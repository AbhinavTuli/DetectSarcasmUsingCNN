"right now it is 11:25. i am sitting by myself in the dorm at hardin house. it is raining very hard outside. earlier i went to target and bought a brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so i got home and then had to drive all the way back. i am from tulsa, oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. i love ut however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when i go out at night. i went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged theta. i am having so much fun and i love all of the girls in my sorority. my friends and i have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. when i walk in the room i don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. also since living in austin i have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. i have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. i have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example hula hut, shady grove, dirty's and much more. as i walk down the drag i notice that there is a large variety of people in austin. yesterday i had my first encounter with the infamous leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street. apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. also today when i went to einstein bagels i looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. college in austin is much different than my small private high school in tulsa. i never knew how sheltered we all were and i am so glad that i have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real"" world. right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. it is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. i live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. although there are many distractions at hardin house, i am so glad this is where i live. i have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50,000 plus people. sometimes it is, like when i walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. but then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. i have already found a group of people i ""hang out"" with everyday and i almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. i am so excited for the arkansas game this weekend. football is my favorite sport and i really hope the longhorns can beat ou this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. on tuesday i joined a group call tag, texas advertising group, because i am trying to transfer in to the communications college. i am a little nervous about that because i heard it was very difficult. i am currently in the liberal arts school as an english major. my classes seem to be going very well. i think after this paper i am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the sex and the city dvd with my friends because they are all avid watchers while i have never seen a single episode. i never really get hooked on a tv series. i always just watch the show when it comes out on video.

"well i am beginning this assignment and already i'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. sometimes i wonder why i care about that stuff but i really don't know, and my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which i why i think i will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because i seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when i begin to let my mind roam free. now i'm thinking why am i thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but i guess thats the idea of this experiment, and i am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that i'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then i would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and i had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and i would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that i am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as i type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and i just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but i think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in yugoslavia, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in pennsylvania, but had to move here to austin for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to austin community college, and i know this because i asked him, and i asked him because i was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. he says he likes it here in the states as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and i guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in international business, and my other roomate, troy, is a business major at ut, and i am somewhat of a business major, with my major being sports management, which is in the college of education because it is a branch of kiniesiology, which i don't know if i spelled right, but i supposed i should learn how, but anyways my major is more of a business major, like troy and djordje, which is pronounced george, so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then i have another roomate named john, whom i have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to nebraska with him, and his sister lynnsie, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in houston at the time, moved to san antonio when i was in 7th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year. i figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and i hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but i guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. but anyways, as i was saying there are 3 business majors, then john is a chemical engineer also studying at ut, and he, along with me and troy, who is 22, are all freshman, and djordje is a sophomore. i sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since troy and i have met. he seems like a very interesting person to me, and i figure i will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but i guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. speaking of parents, i hate to admit it, but i truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. before i was to leave to move in to my apartment i couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and i would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and i was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, i already missed them, and i can't wait to see them again. pretty sad on my part i guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, i just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life i was afraid of dogs, and now i see the clock and i'm running of out of time, and it said my 20 minutes are up, so thats all i have to say.

"so i'm a little nervous because i don't know what to do about my fig meeting today. i'm supposed to have it at 3:30, but last week no one was there. i can't decide if i want to go back out into the heat or just skip it. i wonder if it can count against you if you skip a fig meeting. i feel so stupid about being nervous to email the instructor. i am so excited about this wrist band thing. i wonder who i will go with to the ou game. i can't believe it is so soon. i'm freaking out. i hope i get a date. lets see. i promised to get me, patty, and kelly a ticket so i can get three more for other people. i can't believe i am actually seventh in line. i hope the guy wasn't tricking me or lying to me because then i would feel really stupid since i've told a lot of people. oh well. i don't even know what to right on these things. i really wish i was taking a nap right now. my thoughts don't flow as easily when i am being forced to right about them. and i really don't want to say something that could some how embarrass me. although i do that enough anyways. hmmmmm. this class seems like its going to be really hard. i am so confused about what my major should be. why in the world did i choose advertising when i really don't think i have any interest in it at all. i wonder if its ok that i'm not capitalizing my i's"". i'm so used to instant message typing. it gets hard to used apostrophes and capitalize words. oh well. i hope my cousin is doing ok at her new school. i feel so bad that i haven't talked to my parents so much since i've been here. i don't know if i have even called them twice. that makes me sad, i just feel like i don't have any time. man , i really want some kerby queso. maybe i'll get some later. i need to get this printer fixed if i want to be able to print anything out. dang it. i wonder if i need to print out a confirmation sheet for this. wait that is just for the pretesting. which was extremely long. i wonder if we can backspace on this thing. hah. i'm so excited about this weekend's ""white trash party"" my phone is ringing. i wonder if i should pick it up huh. i guess ill just let it ring and listen to the answering machine and see if it is someone important. dial tone. ok and now my cell phone is ringing. ill just look and see who it is. of course its patty. its always patty. i can't believe i got a yellow wrist band! its so awesome. it really annoys me how i always press the caps lock button when i'm typing. i think i do it like once a minute. i must be the worst typer in the world. it really grosses me out to find my roommate's hair all over my floor. i don't know why she can't just pick up the dust buster once in a while. oh i need to unlock my door so patty can get in. oh well, next year's living arrangements will be better. but that really stresses me out! i can't believe i have to get my roommates together like before october. how do you even know who are your good friends yet. well at least i will be with kelly. i wonder if patty is going to want to room with us or if she is just going to want to get her own group to room with. i'm sad kristin is not going to get an apartment. i don't know why she wants to be an ra. it just seems like way too much responsibility. oh well. man i'm hungry , and it is a long long time till dinner. that sucks. oh good, i thought i lost my advertising syllabus. but its on my desk that is good. oh yah, i have to go do study hours tonight. that is good. that means i don't have to do my homework now. maybe i can get in a little nap. or maybe i should see if my fig is meeting today. i really should work out some. i have totally fallen off track on my working out. it totally stresses me out that i'm probably going to gain like the freshman 45. that is going to sucks. oh well at least its better than being 85 pounds like last year. maybe i shouldn't write that on this. oh well, i tell everybody anyways. i just have like absolutely no motivation to work out. they are right about one thing. gregory might be close, but your bed is so much closer. i hope my parents aren't like shocked when they see me again. lol. where is patty. she called like five minutes ago and it definitely doesn't take that long to ride the elevator 4 floors. maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book. i need to tell her i will need it tonight during study hours. she will probably be upset. its my book though. i really need to put away some of this clean laundry. what am i going to wear at the white trash party. i don't know if i really have anything for that. i guess i should go to walmart and get a wife beater or something trashy like that. i really want to wear a trucker hat. ill borrow one. okay here she is. f ",1,0.08636 1.048763 -0.78581 0.420714 0.873343 0.269481 -0.990443 -0.934361 -0.889986 1.24608 -0.227982 -0.590446 -0.935595 -0.645364 -1.016468 0.0 -0.04277 0.772392 0.807047 -0.31243 0.767362 0.039856 -0.461451 -1.154668 0.826915 -1.036934 -0.212029 0.13624 -0.461961 -0.617236 -1.100231 -0.272201 0.017991 0.778047 0.127039 -0.34885 0.694747 -0.269468 0.607491 1.384895 -0.271266 1.797953 -0.743737 -0.460466 -0.128441 -0.111217 -0.269341 -0.254213 0.358287 -0.530504 -0.497592 -0.375816 -0.940896 0.832418 0.446989 -0.332727 -0.668203 -0.096345 -1.534071 -0.113019 0.116973 -0.582467 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.002615 0.596973 -0.086094 1.077429 -0.829074 0.024709 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.119227 -0.337085 0.28364 0.668045 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.351176 4.923119 4.034047 5.03517 5.215034 4.466787,2074
"i guess i have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. as i'm writing i keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when i'm supposed to finish typing. i think about what i was thinking in class when you talked to us about this hw and how i wanted to talk about certain things while i was doing. but actually i start thinking about what happened tonight. we all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. i wish my roommate would listen to better music. after capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. we put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. afterwards our president asked us to make this a dry event. i support him 100% because one i don't drink, two i don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three i think that all the points that he made were very strong. my roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. i think that they are wrong anyhow because as president i think that ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and i don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. it was an executive decision. i'm debating whether i should go outside to the pool with everyone else when i'm done with that. i was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but i will see her on monday so i'm still happy. this weekend i have lots of things to do. i'm running through my schedule for the weekend. tomorrow i have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. i keep on thinking about what else i'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. i have never really sat down and typed everything i'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that i type just like i think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. my leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. but after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. we'll see if we actually will keep it but i think we will. i'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. i think about everything else i could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing i really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. i am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though i would still have liked to see my friend tonight. i kind of like this girl but i'm not sure. she's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where i can say that i like her but i do think that she's kind of interested. i also think about my friend who is coming up from southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. we have been friends for a long time and we get along great. but the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so i'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. i know that it can't be too much because i have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time i don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. if anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. we will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. i have the full intention of not having sex. i never have and never will until the day i get married. i have thought about being a priest for a long time so i'm just waiting for god to give me my call and i will follow his will. i really hope that he hurries up though cause i don't have a lot of patience. i think that i have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. i can be patient for certain things but i just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. i know that god doesn't count in that but i try to hurry him up. one of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make god laugh all you had to do was to tell him your plans. i'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. i guess that it all depends on whether you are christian or catholic or simply don't believe in god or have another religion. i realize that there are a lot of people here at ut that simply doesn't believe in god and i think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. i keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. i wish that everyone would be able to believe in god and receive the eucharist everyday. it is the most amazing gift that god gave us. it's sad how some people just ignore god or sometimeseven laugh in his face. this was what i originally wanted to talk about when i was thinking about what i was going to write in this paper. i thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that i can write on but then i realized that i couldn't do that because it would have been planned. so i decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. for the most part i think that it worked because as i think back of all the things that i have written for the past 20 minutes i have gone through various different topics. ranging from drinking, to girls, to god. i think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. i realize that the time is up and that i no longer need to be writing but i'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. i notice that i almost finished a complete page of writing.

"i didn't know there was a timer on this thing. this is kinda weird typing all my thoughts. my ring is broken. my ice cream is really good. that place down stairs has good ice cream. i'm tired. i need to go look for a new job today. i am going to 3 different chili's to apply. i like my mousepad. my roommate just came in and it scared me. she just turned on the water. i'm thirsty. this ice cream is making me thirsty. i want to go home today. i miss my friends and family. but i'm not going to go home today. i am going to stay here. 20 minutes of writing your thoughts is a lot of time. which means a lot of thoughts. i have to read like 3 chapters for oceanography because i keep forgetting to read. so now i'm really really behind. i need to catch up so i don't fail. i need to go to the grocery and get some more food and drinks for in here. i'm almost out of cokes because i go through them so fast. my roommate is talking to me about laundry. i haven't done laundry here yet. i went home last time to do it (to round rock). she said the washing machines are really small and the dryers are really big. we just swept in here. it gets dirty pretty fast. and you don't even notice. i want a college of education t-shirt. i saw one today but it was for the education council. and i don't think i want to join that. i don't like ""counseling"" haha. but really i don't like speaking in front of people or anything. so i'm sure that would not be fun for me. but-i don't know what i am talking about right now. klint just came online. yay. he must have just woken up. it's kinda late. but he wakes up late. that's ok though. i wish i could sleep late. i have classes too early to sleep late. it's kinda weird because i don't like to go to bed early. so it would be really good if i had late classes. education council sounds like you just bond with the teachers and stuff. like student council. so yeah-not for me. i like klint. i have not seen him in a while. i also have not seen chris russell in a while. my phone is ringing. stop ringing. it's carl. i have not talked to him in forever. sara likes her pants. i have some like those. i got them from target. i want to go shopping. i don't have any money though. i saw tiffany's sister in class the other day and i didn't know if it was her. so i didn't know whether or not i should say hi. but she had her eyebrow pierced so i didn't say hi. and i told tiffany that and she said i was lucky that i didn't say hi to her because she would have been really mean to me. that sucks. i don't like mean people. i hate making friends. it's so hard to be able to tell who your real friends are or not. i don't really have any friends here yet. i met one guy. and i have a few other friends who i see off and on. but still. all my friends left. which is not very cool. i want to burn a cd. i have a whole bunch left. i need to renew my internet service. it doesn't expire til sept. 23rd though. i need to look for those blue books. my spanish teacher said we need some for monday. and i have some because jenny gave them to me. the lawns outside must be getting mowed. i hear a lawn mower. anywho desiree needs a blue book so i need to find them so i can give her one. so yeah. i like the pictures in my room. they remind me of my friends. i miss them. jenny is having a lot of fun i think. she has 5 roommates but they all share an entire floor. and there are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a living room and everything. that would be cool. i wish i had money to buy that here. but next year i am getting an apartment with katie i think. she wants to get fish but i don't like fish. they die too easily. katie gave me a big texas poster. she knows that i hate museums and stuff like that and she went to the bob bullock museum with her family and got me that poster. to be funny. so now i'm going to put pictures of my friends like riding the horses and stuff. i just realized that my psych class is not 2 hours long. it's only 1 and a half hours. i just thought we got let out early all the time. 20 minutes is a long time. although it seems a lot shorter when you type everything you're thinking. but that's still a lot of thoughts. i would hate to grade these things. almost over. only 20 seconds left. i want more ice cream so hurry up and finish. i need to get a new pencil sharpener.

"right now i am very tired, and i really don't know why. i got enough sleep yesterday, but then again i had a very busy day yesterday. it must have been when i went to try out for the texas crew team. i am not sure whether i should join, and it has been bugging me all day. if i join, i will have to sacrifice many things. first off, i would have to get up really early in the morning and i am not use to that. second, time would be another sacrifice. i would have less time to do other things, and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. i am really missing the girl that i left back home in order to come attend the university. she was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. we got along great, hardly ever fighting. i miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. her parents were really good to me also. this girl was going through a really hard time in her life when i met her. i am greatful that i was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. that time was when her parents were getting divorced. she got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. this upset her a great deal. i enjoyed the fact that i could be there for her when she needed me. as a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. her stepsister is really making her life tough. for that, i resent her stepsister. she disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. this girl is named emily. emily really pisses me off a great deal. why does she have to be that way. nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. i think about my girl quite often, but i know that i am up here for the reason of getting an education. i don't know whether i should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when i am home. but while i am in austin, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. it seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. at first i was bit scared, but i know i can come out on top if i put the work and time in. it is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. but it can be done. i am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at ut. i plan to do the best that i can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing i will make it through alright. wow, it has already been twenty minutes and i've got to make a class.

"i'm just sitting here typing. mu light is pretty bright. i got it at office max. i got it with my mom the last night she was here in austin before she went home. we had gone to target earlier that night and i saw one of my friend's car parked outside. it was weird because he is going to syracuse in new york. my psychology book says gazzaniga on it and i am assuming that that is one of the writers of the book. there's a picture of my sister and me on my book case. we went to florida last summer. it was fun. we stayed on a tiny little island with my entire family . there is a little buddha guy sitting next to the picture looking at me. he is not actually looking at me because he doesn't have eyes, but his carved out eyes are pointed in my direction. my grandparents gave it to me. they are pretty cool. my grandfather was in the navy. i've been to maine many times and i always go to my mom's uncle's house and play with all my little cousins. those are some fun times. i'm taking management information systems 310 with dunn. she seems pretty cool. the book is red and has a little blue box on the side that says prentice hall. come to think of it, i think my econ book is also published by prentice hall. i was listening to a song earlier by a band called outlandish. good song. there's a sticky note underneath my lamp. my mom gave me this biscotti tub. i don't know why, but she did. i keep mints in it. i have a pack of green gum sitting next to me. it's doblement, the good kind. i'm already tired of writing and i'm only 6 and a half minutes in to this. i still have mono so that could be attributing to my tiredness. i have had it since late february, early march. it's a pain in the butt. i was fine for a while, but right before school started, i could feel it coming back. it's weird how i can feel it coming back. my roommate had to go to some scholarship dinner. i don't know when he will be back, but he is pretty cool. my computer speakers were made by harmon'kardon. i had never heard of them before. maybe i had, but they aren't a big named company yet. this could be their way of promoting their product. by striking a deal with hp. my monitor is big. it's a 17 inch flat panel. it's nice on my eyes. i used to sometimes wear contacts. i hate those things. they make my eyes all messed up. by the end of the day, my eyes hurt so bad, i can't even stand to keep them open. so i decided to go with glasses. i wear them at night and when i'm in class sometimes. i can see alright without them, but there is some things that i really need them for. my spanish teacher is kind of weird. i wasn't sure what i thought of him at first. but he seems like an alright guy. i saw him at the gym the other day. i need to work out more. but sometimes i'm just too tired or not in the mood or just don't want to go. my ex-girlfriend used to encourage me to go. i actually started going for her. but then gave it up when i got mono. i used to go to the athletic club. i remember walking in from the cold december days after school. it was still cold in january and february. i love the feel after working out. when my whole body feels numb. i don't know what causes it, but it feels good. it's even better when you work out inside and then go outside where it's really cold. i love that feeling too. but yeah, i went running the other day and got that numb feeling when i was done. my dad runs a lot. he is super cool. he went to west point and all that and still he is a lot of fun. he is serious when serious stuff needs to be done, but all the other times he is cool. my mom does a lot for me too. she helped me move in and whatnot after my dad had to go back. i haven't eaten candy since i have been here. i have decided that candy is one thing that i don't need. i've been trying to eat better and i think i've been doing a good job. i take vitamins every morning and try to eat something too. i have never eaten breakfast and i regret not doing so. i have started trying to eat breakfast but it's just not appealing to me. oh well. my ceiling has all these little bumps in it. my mom painted my sisters room and used a sponge thing and made the walls kind of bumpy. it is cool. it reminds me of a sky kind of. i went to the football game on sunday. that was awesome. quite the blow out. it rained a lot of the game, but it was still fun. it was my first ut football game. my sister goes to tcu and i went to one of her games, but they have no school spirit. here, everyone gets involved and that's what makes it so much fun. i went down to the box office to get a football ticket for a friend, but they said that i probably wouldn't be able to get one because they were almost all sold out and i would have to wait until friday to even try. it should be a good game though. we are playing arkansas at 11 am. early game compared to last weekends 6pm game. last game i went in to the wrong gate and had to walk all the way around to find my seat.

"today all i think about is snow skiing, i cannot wait to be in the mountains, its so liberating and right now i feel so tied down and constricted, my room is annoying me at the moment because i do not like my desk space, it is uncomfortable so i find it hard to work in, which makes me not want to do anything at my desk. right now i feel so lost in life, there are so many things that i want to do and i know i have all the time in the world, but i feel like everything is moving so fast, especially now that my best friend is back at school, i feel we just started summer together yesterday and now he and i both are gone and back our separate ways, which is for the best, but at times it is so hard because i feel like a whole sector of my life is missing and i spend most of my days thinking about it and how it really is not that long until we see each other again and i look forward to the coming years but i get scared because i wonder if my future involves him. we have many of the same passions and we desire to do the same things, but i wonder if we will do them together or own way. i constantly think about my future but not really the success aspect, but rather the things that i want to do the things that make me happy, which for awhile would not include a job. i guess i don't really think about growing up that much but really like i said earlier that all i think about is going skiing this winter, i feel like the mountains are my home, like that is where i belong and i am itching to get back, because i have not been in so long. when people ask where my favorite place to be is, it is definitely the mountains. its like this little place god created where i can get away and forget about everything that drags me down, and just allow me to stand in awe and take in all that this earth has to offer, its like it releases me. not only that i love skiing it is my favorite form of exercise, and its just all i can think about considering how hot it is here and i cannot wait to get away the heat and get where the air knocks you off you feet.

"pennebaker i used to think it was spelled pennebaker and i couldn't logon to the web page cause i kept spelling it wrong, silly me. but that's the story of my life i guess, one time, i thought i was going to psy class, but i had the day wrong, and i ended up going to a chemistry class!! and i said to the guy next to me, ""is that the usual guy who teaches?"" and he goes, ""yeah"" duh. and my eyes are pretty bad and so i was like, okay. and then well, he started talking about chemistry, and that's when i realized that i had the wrong day and was in the wrong class. but i was such a nincompoop, for some reason, i just didn't want to leave the class, maybe it was the really hot girl who sat down next to me, yeah, i guess it was probably her, but anyway i ended up staying in there and finding the class very interesting, and so i wouldn't look like a freshman, which of course i am, i started to take notes. you know, i won't keep them or anything, but i couldn't just sit there while this guy was giving this awesome lecture and not take notes!!! especially when that girl next to me was taking notes so fast like. but there's too many girls are this school. i mean, wait, i mean, too many girls who think they're pretty and try to hard. maybe there's too many guys in the same class, i wouldn't know. but like, i find it amazing. i mean, of course, in highschool, they're were girl who tried so hard to impress everyone and make themselves so beautiful, and all us guys were like the ones who try the hardest are the ones who fail the hardest!!! fail meaning don't do a good job of making them selves look good. i don't know, i just always preferred the beautiful ones who didn't have to paste on the makeup on for hours every morning. sometimes, i would and still wonder how long it takes a particular girl to get ready to go to a college class. it looks like it takes them forever! it's amazing, i just get up, take a shower, do the person hygiene things that everyone does, put some clothes on, and go. i don't know. maybe i should spend more time getting myself prettier. i just find it disgusting, that's all. and one time, one of my friend sent me this email with the most awful, brutal, disgusting pictures i've ver seen. i was so depressed for like days after i saw them. i don't know what they were of, i mean, if it was a war or what not. but it was these pictures of people who were dead, and they way the died, it was just horrid. i mean, i've seen some nasty deadly pictures of hanging and shooting people and everything, but these were just simply horrid. and i never get sad or depressed these days, at least not any more. i used to be though. and get this, it was cause of a girl that i was so depressed!! can you believe that!? i was going out with her, right, and it was all good, and then one day she said not any more, and i couldn't believe it. it was such a shock, i was amazed, and therefore depressed for like, well, for months, probably around 6 months were i felt that i was leading two separate lives!! it was horrible. and you know, with things like that, the only thing that helps is time. lots of it. i guess that's what my uncle is going through. uuhh, lemme see, i think it was probably about 5 months ago, maybe more, maybe less, my cousin was at a party where many illegal substances were being used, cocaine, speed, you know, those terrible drugs. he ended up getting in to a fight over the use of a telephone with some african american male (my cousin and i are hispanics, well, i'm just half hispanic and half white, but he was pure blood) and they got into a fight, and the african american guy ended up stabbing my cousin and killing him. it was instant or anything, my cousin was a really big guy. strong and big and everything. he had a wife and a daughter. she's so beautiful. she had no idea what was going on at her fathers funeral. i mean, she's old enough to walk and talk and stuff like that, but she was clueless. and so i was i for that matter. she probably understood it more than i i did the more i think about it. his funeral was so so, well, the most beautiful and sad thing i've ever seen in my life. that's what my mom said about princess diana's death, but it pertains to this as well, at least for me. we buried him. in a cemetery, next to some family members. he was 21. it wasn't his time. it wasn't his place. but, god has a reason for everything, you know. i wonder if i'm just writing this out and nobody is going to read this, and i wonder if and when you, if there is a you, reads this, when that will be. it's 5:28 p. m. wednesday, august 10th, 1997. i miss him. another really close friend of mine died of cancer on march 13, 1995. but we won't go there, things just kind ad up you know? anyway, did you know that right now and for the past 2 decades neptune has been the farthest planet from our sun!? did you know that!? i didn't! i was amazing, my thumb is really hurrying from hitting the space bat so darn often. i miss my cousin. i didn't know him well enough. my other cousin, all the full blood ones, the true ones, they took it a lot harder that i did. they were into to things like that, and it was like a wake up call for them. for me, it was a wake up call that i don't' think i'm ever going to pick up. it's like it hasn't really happened, still. after all this time, i still hasn't really happened!!! is that amazing? talk about denial. but it's more than just denial for me, i mean i truly still don't think it's hit home yet. it s just one of those things you read about, see on t. v. it's not something that happens to your cousin. my cousin was murdered. my cousin was murdered. can't believe that, saying that, my cousin was murdered!? is it true? was he murdered seriously!? can that be, is it possible!? is that so!? is that so!? i pray to god that the person who killed him realizes his sins in jail, for the next 25 years at least without bail, and i pray to god he repents for his sins, and i pray to god that god forgives him, cause lord knows i never will in memory of shawn albert deolloz ",1,-0.367532 -0.298955 -0.81186 -0.258895 -0.62182 -0.160012 -0.314275 -0.600156 -0.461931 2.170023 -0.157651 0.06915 -1.439557 -0.224061 -0.674755 0.0 -0.04277 0.289335 -0.844648 -0.277637 -0.965935 0.767042 0.741766 -0.462101 0.250899 0.012263 -1.38494 0.174554 0.084874 -0.310633 -0.909462 -0.499286 0.566814 -0.906028 0.056071 0.92879 -0.690461 -1.020899 0.724367 -1.032253 -0.113151 0.278803 -0.604326 -0.403769 0.837016 -0.247893 -0.927831 1.221276 -0.068139 0.829799 1.248144 -0.532688 2.732799 -1.591034 -1.124943 -0.276199 0.363165 -0.609366 0.403613 0.620263 0.30449 -0.781914 2.204314 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.50215 2.901815 0.005427 -0.23436 1.188718 2.169143 -0.337085 0.334481 0.063965 0.042913 1.344146 1.629555 4.938642 3.974314 4.842563 4.381121 4.743914,165
"okay, i've begun writing. one thing i should probably point out as i recall the above statement about disregarding grammar is that i spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as i type are second nature to me, so it's not like i've gone back and fixed all the errors. which doesn't mean that there probably aren't any run on sentences in here. okay. that's been said. right now my roommate is being fairly loud. i find that bothersome. i'm not sure if he's stupid or inconsiderate. i'd rather be at home right now. i was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now i'm having trouble getting the motivation to do anything. it made the summer more fun at the time, but it was maybe not such a good idea. ideas are like that because of that whole 20'20 hindsight thing. i'm looking at the vents on the side of my computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gills. i'm not looking forward to having to do the other writing assignment. which is not to say i think it'll be difficult, but this assignment requires almost no discipline. the other one will require me to have directed thought, and that's not really that big a deal, but it's one thing to sit down ready to do a task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long you're supposed to be doing it. what i mean to say is that the time will seem to pass more slowly because i'll be watching the clock, so i'll probably be more bored, and i don't like to be bored. i'm not very far into this but my train of thought seems to have stopped. probably because my roommate(or actually suitemate; i have a room to myself but share a refrigerator, microwave and two bathrooms with two other guys)keeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly. it wouldn't be so bad if he'd just shut his door, but for some reason he hasn't thought of that. they've wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of my door now. now they seem to have left, so maybe i can concentrate. no, that didn't work. i've found it previously difficult to make my mind blank intentionally, but now it seems to come quite easily. i think probably i'm tired. the cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at my home, so when there's nothing else to do i usually watch something like comedy central late at night and shave a few hours off of a healthy amount of sleep. that's better; time's passing quickly now. which i normally wouldn't like, but this is something i wouldn't have done if it wasn't a grade(no offense to anyone involved in this research)and when you're forced to do something you want it to end quickly. i think the air conditioning in this dorm is screwed up. it's hot right now, and i had to buy a fan earlier to keep it semi-cool in my room. it doesn't work all the time. like right now. the fan's blowing on me, but i'm not cool. there he goes again. i think my roommate's playing 'sympathy for the devil' now. which isn't so bad, because that's a good song. i tried to learn the piano once, but i didn't stay on it for very long. i found that the teacher was really good for nothing, because i could learn everything she taught from the book itself. but when i stopped going to lessons i found too many other things to occupy my time, and stopped practicing. i would have liked to have been able to play the keyboard parts in several rolling stones songs. and several other of the 'older' bands' songs. most modern music is pretty much no good. and that brings an end to my twenty minutes.

"well today i feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. like today i had to do this writing assignment to get it out of the way and do my math homework. by the way, i have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. anyways this weekend was pretty fun since i went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. i am a transfer student and i really miss austin community college (the college i went to last year). at acc you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the university of texas. today i have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on mondays. next week will be my first week to start work so i am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest i am going to get with school and work. it is my first job so i don't know how i am going to deal with it. well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time i don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally i am not a real psychology fan. i mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. i believe that god does everything for a reason so why question what god has done he knows everything. don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. for example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. another example is that i still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all i know. there are other terms that i am not to familiar with also and i hope i understand them better soon before the test. i really want to get good grades this semester so i don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the university of texas. i really don't know that many people here, but i have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to university life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. well i think that is about all i have to say today, hopefully i will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses.

"today was an easy day for me since i only had two classes to attend. in math, i really had a hard time staying awake. i didn't know if it was because i knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. either way, i was very tired and at times, i just dozed off. in my edp class, i had to find information on financial aide. i also had to start a checking account at the credit union. by chance in the corner of my eyes, i could a brochure on financial loans for students. so i picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. right now i'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on friday. it's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. i probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. english at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. i had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. i tries to call tex many times, but had no luck. now i have to get used to waking up early every tuesday and thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. it's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that i can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. i really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on wednesday, i didn't take one and when i attended the class, i had a hard time staying awake. i'm glad that i'm in college now because i feel more independent than at home. my mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. but it gets to a point where i kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick. i can't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother. i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it. he still thinks he can beat me, but that won't probably ever be true until i'm about 60 and he's 57. this weekend, i hope to attend the football game with my friends again. i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot. it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before. it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. i might even paint my face to show some school spirit. maybe not. after i finish this assignment, i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday. i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment. the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it. my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. i think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. i guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo's was out of them. textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. i think my time is up so that's all i'm going to write. i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that's the purpose of this essay. so, that's all.

"i'm sitting here listening to a trance cd of jimmy van m who i recently saw at hyperia in houston, texas. as best as i can express my sensations and reactions to this music something will always be left unsaid. the music is a magical, emotional journey that not many people understand. those that do, however, are purveyors of another plain of consciousness that will forever stay with them. a grammatical explanation is hard to find when most people are entirely withheld from experiences that have the guaranteed potential to alter people's lives. i often think of teddy roosevelt's idea. ""far better it is to dare mighty things than to take rank with those poor timid spirits who know neither victory or defeat. "" i for one am a great example of the power that is contained in some of the things i've experienced. i wish i could really delve into these things sometimes without hesitating with regards to the repercussions. but, then again, the leap of faith is something everyone must do on their own. someone can only be shown the door. you must have the initiative within to step across it on your own. as much as i've seen and endured i sometimes wonder if i really have seen everything that is the best. then i remember what i thought before my experiences and i know that there is still so much more out there for me to jump on. avoiding selfdestruction is also a daunting task sometimes and an everpresent one. one i am no longer fearful of fulfilling. life really is too short to worry a fraction as much as most people do. this is a cold, hard fact. i'll be damned if i'll be lying on my deathbed reminiscing about all the missed opportunities. i'll croak knowing that i choked everything out of life and then some, and then a little more.

"this is getting really old this is my second time doing this because the page keeps shutting down or going back and i have no idea what's happening to my other writings. so now i'm getting really annoyed because i have other homework to be doing . i also have to do the prescreening because i tried doing it last night and the computer kept crashing. i'm watching the sandlot i remember this movie from when i was a little kid me and my brothers would always watch it. they always tried to make me watch michael myers and i'm so scared of him. they used to dress up like him and have his mask and hide in my room at night. they were pretty mean to me. now that i'm gone i miss them so much. mayra and john keep arguing and whispering stuff to each other and i wish they would stop they make it so obvious that they don't want me to hear. i hope i don't have to start over again because that's going to make me so mad. i'm going to the incubus concert next week and i'm so excited the only thing that sucks though is that i have a test on monday in this class and also my precal class which means i have to hurry up and study and not slack off. i don't want to be one of those students who mess up at the very beginning of their college years and then wish they wouldn't have. this timer is going really slow and i'm getting really sleepy i didn't go to bed until six in the morning. i was up watching videos and eating cereal today is nichol's birthday and instead of me buying her something she bought me a glow in the dark wish bear. i thought that was very sweet of her but i feel bad because i have no idea what to get her for her birthday she has everything that she could possibly want. were going to go eat at red lobster on saturday and were going to the movies to watch wicker park. i already saw that movie this weekend but i liked it so i want to see it again. it was about a girl who becomes obsessed with this guy. i wonder why people become obsessed with others i mean does it have to do something with their brain or is it just lust and they want to get their way. i hope i do good in college i don't want to mess up. i'm not even sure what i want my major to be. i was premed at the beginning and i still am but it seems really difficult and it needs a lot of determination and hard work. i know i could do that if i really wanted to but i want to have a life outside of school and it seems that's all that doctors have time for, books and work. so i'm getting really hungry and my head is starting to hurt john and mayra are still arguing and i don't like it at all. i feel bad when people argue because i feel i should try to make everything better. i know its usually none of my business but i like to make people happy. all of my friends tell me that's a bad quality because i never end up doing what i want. but the thing is i don't want to hurt anyone especially those i care about. i feel like i'm hiding so many things from so many people but they would never understand me and plus i don't want to disappoint them. i know that if they really loved me they would understand and be happy for them but i'm not sure i want to take that chance especially if i don't even know what's going to come out of it. i'm probably not making any sense right now and i wish this would hurry up because they are really getting mad now and i'm using johns computer so i feel like i'm using him and mayra is getting mad at him and he is doing me a favor by letting me use it. they left the tv on a baseball game and i don't want to watch that. i need to go and check in with my job because i need to start working already. i'm running out of money and i don't want to ask my mom for money because she has bigger things to worry about i just want to make it on my own and make her proud. they are all doing so much for me to be here that i don't want to make them doubt why they believe in me so much. i really want to go home and watch tv and fall asleep and forget about everything that's going on right now i feel like pretty soon everything is going to crash and burn and its going to be all my fault and i'm going to be left with nothing except regret. i regret not being honest with everyone right now but i'm just trying to take things one day at a time. hopefully everything will get easier and make more sense because i have no idea what i'm going to do if it doesn't. i hope that everything that is happening is happening for a reason ",1,-0.700745 -0.155713 1.087037 -0.35148 0.68874 -1.191782 -0.670643 -0.504641 -0.488804 1.041601

"well i am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering i hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. too bad that i have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study i will be leading for kappa that i have little time to rest i really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because i have so much going on that i feel guilty if i am not always being productive. i know that i need to take time every day just to sit with god and tell him what is going on in my mind. so that's what i want to do with this exercise i am going to type everything i think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to god. i hate that i feel like i constantly need to be watching my money, or what i eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like i am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? i know i human, and that i am sinful and that i can't do anything on my own. so i don't know why i get disappointed in my failures, why should i expect anything else??? i feel pretty guilty about how much time i put into some of my relationships as well, like i wish i was there for lauren f. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. i also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, i need you to make me aware of when i start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when i start to keep a constant tab on how much i spend or what people owe me. lord i want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something i deserve because i know that i do not! i also know that i need to take a nap this afternoon if i want to get any work done later so i pray that i would be able to do that as well. i have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. you and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. lord i want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. i feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when i can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. i really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do! i hate that i was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, i am also so worried about david, mp, and nancy, i just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you lord, and understand your love for them. i wish i knew what to expect on this phl test coming up on thursday, but there i go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. i am worried that i am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as i should be but i know that i am doing the best i can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. i am so glad i got to spend time with ford this weekend and i really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in atlanta because i know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. but i know he was supposed to be here this weekend and i am so glad that he got to talk to chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. i feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason i am really upset that the tuna fish i bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $4???? come on louise you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly i am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but i know that i need to be really giving that to you and i really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. i am really hot so i had to go turn on the fan. i wonder when becca and martha are getting back, is it wrong that i kind of like that they aren't around right now? why is it that i like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? i am kind of worried about kyle maybe liking me, i really don't want him to, because i really love having him as a friend and i really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason i've been getting that vibe lately so i really hope that i can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. man that 7up stuff i got is disgusting!!! why do i always try those things. healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. i really hate that i am always feeling like i need to be repaid when i do something for someone i mean seriously! why can't i just give out of love and show like grace like christ did to us??? i am really excited about this psych class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. i am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep i got on saturday i really need to get rest because i know i don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! i just wish i would enjoy it i pray that i could have a peace so that i could sleep right now.

"i've never liked writing and any other literature stuff like reading. i also feel a bit different because i've never done my homework on the webpage before. it's a new thing for me. everything in college feels different. the schedule is flexible; you can have classes from 10 to 11 and then jump to 3 to 4, not all continuously throughout the day. there's also the good thing that i don't have to go to classes i don't want to go to. this freedom of choice gives me a feeling of relaxation but also fear. i feel great that i can do whatever i want, but feel fearful that my choices might not be the best for me. this assignment gives me a feeling of nervousness. i hate writing, especially when i have a time limit on it. it's hard enough for me to come up with stuff to write about when i have plenty of time, and it gets harder when i have a time limit, whether or not that there is no right or wrong things to say. i feel like i'm saying many wrong things because a lot of this is not so much feeling but some experiences i went through in college. i can't write about my feelings for 20 minutes because it's hard to know what i'm feeling and even harder to write about it.

"i just got out of psychology class like an hour ago so i thought i would do this paper while i am still in the thinking mode. i thought what pennebaker said about how students new to the college experience, like myself are under lots of stress. that is true. and how they are more prone to get sick when they go home because their stress is relieved. but i think i am sick right now because i've been coughing a lot and my nose is all clogged up. i think it's from the air conditioning in my dorm. but i'm not supposed to be sick now, right? anyways i've been here in austin for almost three weeks now and i have had lots of new experiences but i am beginning to get homesick. i miss my mom, dad, and sisters, and the city of houston. i am glad that i have friends from high school here that i can lean on. just ate dinner. it was really good and now i'm really full. my dance class starts tomorrow, can't wait for that. i don't like sleeping on the top bunk, don't sleep very well, been taking lots of naps. probably cause i stay up too late and have to get up early. lots of traffic noises outside. can hear buses. reminds me of when i got on the completely wrong bus the first week of school. i met a guy and have been hanging out with him. he seems really cool. i want to us to be friends but scared he might want to be more than friends. just adds to all the stress. i really need to be at the library studying right now. i think i will go when i finish this. just learned how to play racquet ball the other day. it's really fun, but very exhausting. i am so sore. also my legs hurt from walking around campus so much. i am really out of shape. everybody is concerned about the freshman fifteen but i really don't care if i gain fifteen pounds. it is highly unlikely since i eat like a bird, but i would be okay with the extra weight. i'm not going home until the end of september which means i will be going five weeks without seeing my family. i've never gone for more than a week without seeing them. can't wait to go home and see them and go to a pat green concert in houston. seems like not many people here listen to country music which is mostly what i listen to, although i do like other kinds of music. my twenty minutes is up. got to go!

" as of this moment, i am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. i don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. i notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. i am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. i wonder what he has to say. i have this funny taste in my mouth after eating taco bell food. it isn't too pleasant. my refrigerator is making lots of noise. i think it's broken. maybe i should get it fixed. no, i'm too lazy. i'm thinking about my boyfriend again. i think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but i don't know why i am thinking that because i love him or atleast i think i do. how do i know when i'm in love? i ask myself this question everyday. i don't think i should be because if i was in love i would know. love is very confusing. my boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. i haven't had this bad of a temper ever. i think some of his temper rubbed off on me. the refrigerator is making so much noise still. i feel nauseous. i want to join a sorority, but i am not sure which one to join because i have heard bad things about the ones i am interested in. i also want to join a service one, but at the same time i want to join a social one. i think i'm just going to join this service one i heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. i miss taco bell. i used to work there with my best friend. i wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. sometimes i feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. she tends to do that. i'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but i don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. well i know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. the refrigerator stopped making noise. yay! i'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. i'm confused about the directions. are we supposed to write until the 20 minutes are over or when we finish? that is what i ask myself. i'm really sleepy. my eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. i haven't gotten much sleep in a while. people keep staying in my dorm room and i can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. sometimes i wish i could just tell people how i feel straight up but that never happens. i think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. she used to get mad just because i told her the truth, so i feel like i'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. well this assignment was good. i got to speak my mind and release some stress.

"my first week here at ut, i went through rush. i was kind of pressured into it by family and friends, but i also wanted to meet people. after a week of being fake and smiling a whole lot, i was invited into a sorority. i'm not the type of girl that loves having a ton of girlfriends, doing hair and make up, and talking about boys. i personally like to keep most of my feelings to myself and doing my own hair (which includes washing it only). i'm not into curling irons or the right eyeliner. those things just really don't concern me. that is what i thought sorority girls were like. some of them are girly girls, but i found a few to click with. i'm still not really sure about the whole greek life thing, but i'm going to try it for a while. the part i really don't like is the whole politics of the whole thing. it is very harsh and costs a lot of money. but, like i said, i'm going to try it. nothing about college has really surprised me yet, and i haven't really been that homesick, which is a very good thing. i do miss my pets back home and my best friend, but the people here are all so nice and friendly that it makes it a lot easier. i am a little nervous about some of my classes but hopefully that will die down after the first test. i was thrilled when i realized my roommate was normal and the fact that we get along so well. right now i think i need to focus on getting more sleep and not getting sick. i know i have plenty of time to go out and have fun and i need to learn to study. my parents keep on stressing to me how important it is to go to class and i know that and i haven't missed a class yet and don't plan on it. i want to do well but have fun at the same time. i don't really know what else. the emmy's are on right now and i really want to watch them. i'm obsessed with tv and movies. i seriously think i watch a movie a day and i guess that is good because rtf is my major. i have a really cute picture of my best friend and i sitting on my desk right now and looking at it is making me want to call her, which i think i will do now.

"so much needs to be done within the next two days, it seems practically impossible to get it done. i have to write these two essays, redo the entire freaking' pretesting crap just because i completed 79% of it and then when it kicked me off, it didn't even save it although i was informed otherwise. so, frankly, i'm disturbed by a lot of things. i have a journalism test tomorrow morning, which, by the way, i haven't studied for, and tonight i had a presentation for apo, a service organization i would like to join if, in the midst of all this chaos called ""college"", i can somehow find the time for a decent social life. so this ""stream of conscience"" theory is going to be more of a ""kelli needs to vent"" period, because frankly, that is all that is on my mind. i had a crappy day, and i don't expect writing this will help me all that much, but i'll go ahead and say what happened. some egotistical freak from the male species grabbed my ass today while i was one of the many cross walks on this large campus. granted i hyper-extended is wrest, at worst i broke it, i would like to request respect from the gender that so frequently asks the inevitable question ""why"" when the finger always points to them!! it was freaking' hot outside all day, and running from class to class always makes it oh so much cooler!! and the whole idea of college is running through me now when i have deadlines for tests, papers, and self-indulgent pompous professors who think they know the answer to the world, and what's even scarier than that is that we pay to wake up at 8 am to go to their lectures and believe the handfuls of bullshit they try to feed us. (i was making a generalization about the professor part of course, some lectures are actually stimulating. ) to top it off, somewhere in the midst of all of this mumbling jumble of chaotic words, i feel almost depressed tonight. i met a guy at the apo organization meeting mentioned before, and i really like him, and i heard that he was interested, but i haven't seen him in six days, and i honestly think that he could actually calm me from this feeling of intense pressure. if i could just see him i would relax and then take a different view on all the crap that i still have to do. i guess i just need him right now, and the longer i go before i see him again, the more distant and hopeless i feel toward him. i guess you can say i've been lulled into inertia by my subconscience feelings to see him. anyway, my twenty minutes of rambling has come to an end, so it was great venting and i hope, in some weird way, this has satisfied your requirements and calmed your thoughts and revelations about the stream of conscience in a frustrated, tired, and ticked off college student.

"it's been almost a week since i have moved to austin to study. there have been times when i miss home, as well as times when i call my dorm room home. i don't understand why exactly i am here. none of this makes any sense. i've grown up, studying at a small school, small church, small community type settings, and i've thrown myself into the largest university in the nation, surrounded by many diverse students of all kinds. my friends have made the transition easier, as well as comforting. however, there's still a little void inside of me. where did it come from though? i see that naturally, god has some sort of plan for me here. but as of now, i have not a clue. no reason, no rhyme. and here i am writing my psychology assignment on the day it was assigned. this never happens. i am the one who's lazy and always procrastinates to the last possible second before even lifting a finger towards any assignment handed my way. yet, i feel like a change is about to occur. a transformation possibly, from a cocoon to a butterfly so to say. leaving behind the old, and embracing the new as it comes my way. i look around my desk, seeing my personal belongs as it reflects my own personality, my soul, my spirit. and i realize, that i'm lacking. i have my mere clothing, and books for my classes, my computer. the only thing that resembles anything about myself is my jars of clay poster, given to me by a friend. this poster is the only tangible object, image to represent myself. do i lack a soul, or have i yet to express it in a more productive manner? why am i even writing about this anyway? why did i begin writing this so early? regardless of it all, i know that he has a plan for my life. everything i do has a purpose for the sake of his glory. whether people acknowledge his existence or not, he is still there and is all powerful. two plus two is four, never five. god is here, and always will. people can choose to ignore him, but his existence still remains. i miss my youth pastor, gary, who taught me to seek god with everything i have. he was the kind of man who'd parents would approve of as a personal mentor. his wisdom and knowledge of every concept in the world baffles me, and kept me curios. but it's his compassion that i miss the most. the tears he shed, when he heard of a young boy committing suicide because his peers perpetual teasing. the affectionate, unconditional love he expresses towards his wife and children. these things, i miss the most. but the one true divine aspect about gary, is that he's a man of god. a man who sought after god without ever holding back. he dove in. not caring where or how, when or why, he dove in. will mankind ever see a man like him again? i look at the clock, and my twenty minutes is almost over, only a minute left for my required writing time. did i do the correct assignment? did i do this the way my professor wanted me to? oh well. blah.

" yes, i'm finally in college. it feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and i'm finally here. it feels good to go home every now and then because i feel important. just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. the smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times i've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at u. t. noticing all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. there is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. i'm feeling really good about my classes and i'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. i can't wait until the weekend comes because the music i'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. i'm glad i'm in college because i here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.

" well i just got back from houston, where i live. it was weird going back. kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though austin isn't my home. it's just my temporary home. it's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that i won't see them for a long time. it was good to see them again. i hope i'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. school is my number one priority. i want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. i don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. i think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. i bet it would never get boring! i just hope i'm not getting in over my head with this class. i've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but i'm afraid i will be over my head. hopefully not. it seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work i know will come. it's very strange being in a class that's so huge! i'm used to being in classes with no more than 30 people. i guess all freshmen are though. i still feel like i'm kind of out of place sometimes here. luckily i've been making friends with the people on my floor. everyone here seems really cool. there are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! i could see myself being friends with them for awhile. i hope so at least! everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (at least the people on my half of the floor does. ) the other side seems very anti-social. we all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but i never see any of their doors open down the hall. it's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. i don't think this makes me a bad friend, i just think i was ready to separate from them. some of them at least. but i thought i was going to miss some of them so much, but in reality, i don't miss many of them. especially some of the friends i was supposedly best friends with. i sometimes wonder if i'm missed. i wonder if i was as good of a friend as i thought i was. i don't know. one of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. she's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. she's a lot like me! surprisingly. it's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. it's cool though that she's like that. it's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! i've only been back for a few hours, and i don't miss my parents! i thought i would miss them more. i think this means i'm grown up now! haha, grown up. that's weird to think. i don't feel like i'm grown up. i still feel like the same old nerd from houston. haha. i finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. they were starting to smell a little funky. danielle, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. i hope she bought good food! hehe. the food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. not like home, but good enough to eat. some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. i could talk about food all day! haha. i can't wait to watch sex and the city tonight with some girs from the floor. since we don't get hbo here my mom taped the last 2 episodes and i brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no hbo! hopefully emily gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at sw in not too long. i have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. especially since it's a class of 14 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. i think it will be a fun class. it's jazz and literature. i love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. hopefully the writing will be fun. i love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. but essays and stuff aren't that fun. i don't know anyone who likes writing them though. my rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. yuck. oh well it's a class i have to take. hopefully i'll enjoy it though. otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every tuesday and thursday.

"so many things i need to get done this week. all of the thinking and remembering gets stressful, but at the same time it's so much fun to be on my own. i had a great workout today at world's gym. i feel bad that i couldn't do a step aerobics class, but their schedule didn't blend well with mine. tomorrow i will accomplish more. i think my day and my feelings are dependent on the amount of exercise i get. i love the feeling when i'm lying in bed at night that i ate very healthy and gave my heart a great workout. i wonder if i'll be happiest being a nutritionist. i've never been able to put my finger on exactly what i want to be. it makes me wonder about those people who become something great and recall in an interview that it's what they wanted to do their whole life, since they could remember. could that actually be? i know i've wanted to be very successful since i could remember. i've always wanted enough money to buy without thinking twice about my purchase. at around thirteen or so i decided that becoming a doctor was my goal and nothing could stop me. now, in actuality, it's possible. i've always made the grades excelling in math and science. i do know it takes a great deal more, but i feel i'm moving in the right direction. my ultimate question is, did i set my goal on becoming a doctor at such a young age because of that profession's stereotype? doctors have lots of money and great cars, and i wonder if that's what made me so determined? but, at the same time biology is my favorite topic to study. i have this strong love for the learning channel when they're showing a surgical procedure. nothing can take me away from the tv. but possibly it's my subconscious telling me that i need to love it? i think i'm thinking about the whole thing a little too hard. i need to start going with the flow of things instead of always feeling i need to have my agenda totally planned out. i feel so much better if i've sat down and scheduled my next day. sometimes i follow the schedule minute by minute, and sometimes i don't. it really doesn't bother me either way if i actually stick to the whole thing. i'm noticing my times up and i almost feel sad. no ones probably going to read this whole thing, or maybe not at all. but i now see why people find diaries therapeutic. this is just like having a diary. i like it and it made me feel better than i did 22 minutes ago. thanks, whoever!

"my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty'sweaty boy. i came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. i am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. i'm usually a really fast typer, because i've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and i did as well, but when i came to ut i found out it is totally wrong for me. i just switched to retail merchandising and i'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than cs was. i think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, i can't even see my life without one. don't think i'm a dork just because i said i was in cs, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy'simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and i believe it. there is just so much to do online. i feel like i might be typing bad, but i'd like you to excuse that. i'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. i wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. i mean i'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so i totally love paris hilton, she is such a riot. i think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but i wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. i want to read it, i think it will be amusing. on a side note, i'm not really sure why i'm eating cheetos, i don't really like them, just every now and then i crave them. i absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. i just dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in your teeth. i really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. i never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because i'm starving and i just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. i hate that. how are you suppose to do something that feels like eternity. i feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. i was going to do it earlier but i was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once i did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. i still have to go back and finish that and i dread it. however, i think my boyfriend is entertained now because i can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh i'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. i have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. i feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, i know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. i hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. i hate how little kids are so fat today. i wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat anything. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done all their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day. crazy crazy. i wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. i'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. i can't imagine it not being computer timed. i can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important? that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere i guess. i'm so hungry its not funny. i'm glad i don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. i feel like my mind is going blank because i'm so bored. i wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. i'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because i know i'll be over the time if i wait till 4 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so i'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even. i feel like i started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm i can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. i don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because i don't know when i started so i dont know when i can end and just go on with my life. i wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. i feel like this is pointless and i'm past my typing time. i have no concept of time, but i don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach'boredom. ouch i just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad i'm not on my computer cause then i could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting. 3:55 will be the new time for completion. 3 more minutes. and i'm stumped. i don't know what to type'talk about. ooooooo 2 minutes and counting. ok randomness: i am not sure what i'm going to do tonight, i might go to a party or something, however i'm not going to dress up really cause i'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . times up.

"okay the way my mind works. well at the present moment many things are running through my head. everyday i think of the same things over and over again until i get them resolved. my mind worries a lot. right now i hope that i get all of my assignments done including this one, and that i do them well. my main concern right now is doing well in all of my classes. i'm so scared that i am not going to do well here and that i am going to have to drop out and go back home. then i won't get as good as an education that i hoped for, which will inturn will prevent me from getting into any good law school. then i won't get a good job, so i can't support myself much less a family, and i wind up a bum for the rest of my life. it's amazing how the littlest things have the biggest affect on something. actuallly, i was just thinking, i hope that my parents will even have the money to pay for my education. if i can't do that than i don't even have to worry about any of this, because i won't be going here at all. i miss my family. for eighteen years i have never been apart from any member of my immediate family. i don't know how i have survived the last two weeks without them. i miss my mother especially. yesterday, i left home again because i went back for the weekend, and i felt as if i were leaving for the first time. the same feelings overcame as they did when i first left her. i wanted to cry. i want to cry now just talking about all of this, but i won't. i tend to do that a lot. hide my emotions. i guess i just figure that by hiding them, i am not as vulnerable to other people as i would be if i were to actually show them. i just realized how incredibly slow i am at typing because twenty minutes have just passed since i began this writting assignment. so on that note i will end my writting entry.

"these past couple of weeks i have felt kind of out of place. not that i haven't been having fun and meeting new people just that it is taking some time to adjust to everything. i sometimes think that i have too much going on and that i need to quit something. between school, texas pom, and soroity i am always on the go, and i never have time to just sit and relax. however, when i get a little time to just relax, all my friends start to come in my room and ask me to go do something or just talk. i don't want to be rude about it, because i don't know all them well enough to know how they would react. for example, i've been feeling sick lately and i really should stay home and get some rest tonight, but all of my pledge sisters are going to a mixer tonight, and i feel that i should go with them. i don't really want to go, but i feel like i need to meet some more people and not let my pledge sisters down. i know that they understand, but i also feel that they might think that i don't like to go out and have a fun time with them. these thoughts have also led me to revaluate why i did texas pom. we have to practice so much a week that i have to miss some of my pledge meetings and give up time that i could use to study or rest. however, i love the girls on the squad and all of the fun that we've had together so far. also, the games are such a rush and make me feel so privalleged to be out there on that field. i would feel like i was letting the whole team down if i quit something that i've been committed to a lot longer than my soroity. plus my coach has been so understanding lately with the adjustments that i'm going through, that it would be hard for me to tell him that i might want to quit. i guess i just need to sit down and eveluate all of the options that i have right now, or maybe just give it another couple of weeks to get adjusted before i make a decision.

" so. stream of consciousness, right. well, i'm in the computer lab right now because i didn't want to do this on my home computer which is pretty messed up at the moment. i don't feel like writing about it. it's quiet in here, and the computers are quite nice. all i hear are the tapping of keyboards. tap tap tap. and what else? i don't nkow. i wish i was doing this in my room so i could be listening to music. the flaming lips which i'm especially into right. i recently bought zaireeka, a fusion of the words zaire and eureeka by them but haven't been able to play it yet. it's a kind of confusing record i guess is the word to talk about. but i've still got like 16 minutes so why not? it's a 4 cds played in unision concept record by the flaming lips. wayne coyne says it's supposed to be about chaos and inspiration or something. it makes sense, trust me. but when i got people over to play it with me (you need 4 cd players and 4 people who want to help play and listen to it with you to play it) it was all chaos and no inspiration. no one really had more than passing curiosity, and when it wasn't going all that smoothly people gave up quickly. but yeah, i still want to play it, just need some people with passion? to hear it with me. what else? blah blah blah. i can't think of anything to write about. 933 934 i'm almost halfway done. some people are talking in another language across from me now. i don't nkow what language. oh, now they're leaving. i think they're indian? so what language does that mean they speak?? i just wrote a sentence and deleted it. i think maybe you're not supposed to do that? don't think it really matters. man, i think this assignment is kind of too long. ten minutes would've been enough. all these people are leaving around me. they're going outside into the sunshine. and i'm staring at this screen. i just spent a while trying to figure out how to do that prescreening stuff too. i registered but then i couldn't find a link anywhere on the site that led to the actual survey. what's up with that? i emailed wendy or whoever. got to remember to do that later now. prescreening survey. do it before sep 9 i think. that's like 1. 5 hours credit. we've hit the fifteen minute mark, friends. that makes this the homestretch. that's sports lingo. not that i know anything about sports. man, that football game yesterday was annoying. it brings out all the rowdy yelling people in the streets. and it's so crowded, you know? i hate it when it gets so crowded on campus, i dread going through it. so many people! why did i go to a school with fifty thousand students? i'm spelling out the numbers now, did you notice? because why rush? no reason, that's why. type tyep type. stream. of. conscious. yep, that's what i'm doing. almost done. nineteen minutes complete, one minute to go. come on, so close. i'm so close to being outside away from the flourescent li ",0,-0.828618 -0.207572 -0.2303 -0.677608 0.022885 -3.411901 0.432372 1.018213 -0.038655 -0.351887 -0.25023 1.904545 0.262334 -1.866803 0.642143 0.0 -0.04277 -0.9909 -1.335027 -0.517127 -1.547815 0.609975 -0.887142 -0.062195 0.630195 -0.189053 0.212675 1.24451 -1.114964 -0.302447 -0.690027 -0.228975 -1.277262 0.064472 -0.028198 -1.109326 -0.302882 0.388952 -0.599162 -0.623589 -0.375317 -0.3001 -0.637348 -0.542403 -1.429535 0.932074 -0.381077 -0.272915 0.690234 -0.858015 1.589963 -0.760551 0.398557 -1.132952 -1.205458 0.394194 0.392727 -0.954251 0.164221 0.148115 -0.415905 -1.248257 -0.480161 -0.267683 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.940452 0.234534 -0.073676 -0.23436 3.577125 -0.153508 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.752509 0.611666 -0.09467 1.586181 4.178423 3.33415 4.427942 4.441286 5.107626,2346
"this is probably the weirdest writing assignment i have ever had to do. usually we are always told almost exactly what to write, but i like the idea of doing this a lot more. i'm not too sure what you guys actually do with this things, but that's fine with me, because i'd much rather me doing this than writing some boring long paper. today is a friday, the second best day of the week. thursday is the best, because my classes end at 12:30 and i only have one class on fridays, so my weekend pretty much starts on thursdays. college life is so much better than high school life. i love having all the freedom. the only part i would change is having someone making sure i get up in the morning for all my classes, i seem to be having problems with that, but i don't think it will happen anymore. i joined a fraternity, so i think that is helping making college more fun. usually when most people think fraternity, they imagine the typical fraternity and everything that goes along with it, mainly the hazing. i joined lambda chi alpha, and it is a national policy of theirs not to haze, so i have nothing to worry about. i've heard stories about other fraternities hazing already, and i don't understand what the point of it is. completely stupid! why would you want to put people through the different kinds of suffering if you're going to live with them for the next 4 years? yes, i understand that it can build strong bonds between each pledge class, but it just means you are always going to hate the class above you that hazed you. being in lambda chi is incredibly awesome, i can't imagine me ever having any regrets. by joining my freshman year, it makes me feel more comfortable at ut than i think i would have been if i had not joined. i no longer think of myself as just another random person, or number, at ut, because i know belong to something. i'm just kind of rambling on here, not really being able to think of much to say. i'm wondering if these are going to be used as examples of things in class, or if they have some other purpose we are unaware of. i think i'll talk more about me, because i'm such a great topic(hint of sarcasm there). i feel incredibly comfortable with my life. i think i am extremely at ease in most situations, and i think i have a good grip on life. i've moved around a lot, so i think that has helped me. i was born in scotland and lived there for two years, then i lived in england for seven years, then california for three years, then new jersey for a year, then i moved back to the same city in california and lived there for almost five years, then three days before the start of my junior year in high school i moved to texas, where i graduated, but my family now lives in california again. being moved around a lot and thrown into new situations has probably made the transition from living at home to being at college a lot easier for me than for other people. when i moved before the start of my junior year, i absolutely hated my parents for taking me away from my friends, and my life, but now i think it has made me a better person because i seem to just go with the flow now and except everything as it happens. alright, well time is up, so i'm going to go.

"being new in texas and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that i've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. all my friends knew me and i knew them. they didn't care about my little flaws. my family was there to support me and care about me. now, i'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. at first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. they have this different feelings and thoughts about me. i may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but i am a forgiving person. i do not hold grudges like others. which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way i talk, the way i dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. i'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. i try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. maybe i'm scared of what people think about me. maybe i'm nervous and afraid because i'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. people who know about their mood swings and personality. but, i don't. at first i didn't think much about all this stuff. i was having a good time in rush and with all the new people i have met. but, things have changes and i kind of wish i had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, i guess the reason i'm hear is because i wanted to get away. or at least i thought i wanted to get away. one thing i don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people i don' know. they usually end up telling me that i should think better about myself or that what i'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. i tell myself every night that tomorrow i'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, i can't change how i've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but i had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. my mom calls about three times a day. we're pretty close. but, when i was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and i thought i just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. i call her too. i tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. i thought i would be that kind of person, but i was wrong. i can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. i don't' remember the last time i had to work at being someone's friend. i wish i didn't have to write this for so long. i just feel like i'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. i can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. i'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. a couple of years ago i used to cry everyday. about nothing about something it didn't matter. i was going to go see a psychiatrist. i've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if i went. i think for a little while i'd tell me parents that i had to go to one. i convinced them. i dot' know what that was all about. just a phase i guess. i'd still like to go to one. i can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. that would be totally crazy. when people tell me their problems i just think about mine and feel bad for myself. i guess i'm self centered or something. i hear people talking in my hall and wish that i could go out there too, but i promised myself that i'd get some work done before i went off to class. i really haven't eaten a lot since i've been here. i skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. its crazy. my appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. oh well. when i get home i'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. my boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. i'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, i learned o accept it because i loved him. or at least i thought it was love. i don't' know yet, and i'll probably never know until i find someone who i feel the same way or more about. that hasn't happened yet. okay, times up.

"at this very moment i am feeling slightly depressed. my roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. that's great. the first weekend of school and she decides to go home. she left me all alone even for the first football game. it's not that i am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. it gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. i'm also a little stressed. moving to college has been fine for me. i haven't gotten home sick, really. and i'm having a lot of fun. but adjusting to how much work i have now is hard. i one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. that's impossible here. and if your not computer literate your screwd. so that means that i am screwed. but on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. i have no option if i want to succeed. succeeding is important. i was valedictorian of my high school. i think that is a curse. it seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. and it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. i want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. i hope it happens. i really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. he is 26 and lives in dallas. what a bummer. not that he is 26 but that he lives in dallas. it is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. most of the time i don't know how to read him. what is he thinking? that worries me most of the time. i don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. we once got into a fight and he told me that i had become to dependent on him. that really pissed me off. i don't believe that i had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. bored because he had moved and i had nothing else going on at the time. how dare he call me dependent. how am i suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to dallas and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. dependent my ass! it just really irritates me. but i don't know what to think about it. moments like these, when i'm all alone is when i miss him the most. and i try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time i can't help it. then i have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. its him that has the problem. why does he have to be so independent? i don't believe that someone can be totally independent. everyone from one time to another needs someone. everyone. so why does he have to act as if he doesn't. i wonder if my time is up yet. i honestly don't think that this has helped me much. its just made me think more. great. yes my time is up. good.

" last night i laid down and i couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, i have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. i have music psychology and ceramics. i'm good at ceramics though cause i got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. i have a lot of great memories. i miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. i feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. i am finally realizing the value of that too. i think its the art . i love art its constantly running thorough my head. the way i look at everything, the way i find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way i am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. i am going to incubus on wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. i feel like i am taking 15 hours but i'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. i am going to work at the frank erwin center hopefully . i was a waitress this summer at el chico. i love mexican food. i am so damn hungry right now. oops can i cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and i felt it necessary. i feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately i've been dead set on being responsible and i am hell bent on making all a's , so when i can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because i was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and i could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that i've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. i remember when i moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and i remember after my dad left standing there looking around. i had no phone, no friends, and no clue and i think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when i look back i have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? i don't know i am just writing as i go along. i like to write. i write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. i like to vent, i need to vent. its almost like when i write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. i don't know maybe i'm weird. i wish i could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so i do poetry as well. but i am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? i am in love. i am not quick to say that either and it is not something i was trying to do or even wanted, but i have found my soul mate believe it or not. he is perfect, and believe me i am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the adhd ) and i love his mind because i appreciate things i cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all i want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. i love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why i like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. i make myself laugh too. i am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. i love that.

"today i bought the new omoide hatoba cd. pure noise and noise art are very interesting forms of music. sometimes there are lyrics to these songs. most of the time they are just phrases being repeated, or just screams. some bands have gone so far as to create their own languages. this type of music bypasses your brain and hits you straight in the gut. words are a very limiting way of expressing how this music makes you feel. i need to remember to go to the video store tomorrow and rent ""purple rain. "" prince is very talented as a musician and actor. i would love top see him in concert. i really hope that the october 24 pavement concert will be confirmed soon. i cant believe that my english teacher is good friends with the lead singer. this is a strange assignment, it makes me wonder what other people will write, and who will read this. will anyone read this? what if someone writes something truly ""offensive"" it's not their fault. one cannot be responsible for their words when they free write. can you imagine if there was an assignment where the teacher tells the students, ""ignore all social constraints and act freely for the next 20 minutes""? that would be pretty wild. in my everyday speech i often swear. by not swearing in this am i limiting myself. but how far can one free write? how much can you open yourself up until its just words thrown together? grammar is not important to this, yet i assume you expect some common grammar to hold this together. am i not free writing now? i would like to go on tour with a professional wrestling league and write about their tragic lives. professional wrestlers mutate their bodies with steroids to the point where they no longer seem human. they destroy their bodies and on occasion fight in steel cages. i wonder if they ever look in the mirror and ask themselves, ""what have i done?"" ""i'm not even human anymore"" their job is to fake fight. the world of celebrities is quite interesting. i wonder if their is an equation that could make someone famous. i could use the scientific method. my hypothesis could be ""if one writes a song on the piano (elton john style) about celebrity after they die, it will be a success. "" i could have started this when versace died and continued it when diana died. of course this would not sum it all up, but after numerous studies, i feel i could ultimately find a mathematical secret to success in the entertainment field.

"okay, well to start off, i'm really not sure or confident of how my experience here at ut will effect me. ""will i succeed, or fail, only time will tell"", i really have a hard schedule for my first semester, a lot of memorizing, which i can do, but just don't want to put that much effort. sound like i'm a no brainer, but if i have to do it ""ill do it"", that doesn't mean i want to. my goal is to have a midrange of a 3. 5 to 4. 0 avg. but right now i'm right this short writing assignment for psy. and i reallly just can't seem to expand my thoughts on the consccious, i guess it's because the prompt says, think spontaneously, but how the hell do i do that if i'm under pressure. excuse my language. but just thinking spontaneously. well i really like this prompt, because there is no right or wrong answers and its just basically a written expression of how one's mind works. i'm not trying to kiss up or anythin, but really i do enjoy this. i would have hoped though, that the class would be a little smaller, so i could ask questions freely and not feel bothered, but that's no excuse i guess, what kind of reputation will i have amongst 50,000 people. well my goal, is to continue doing well academically and also create a good social life. becoz i can't just study and have no fun, that's not in my domain. i've never had stress before, but i might break that barrier this semester. first day of class was pretty cool, because the professor , mr. peddebaker was pretty funny, and i hope i spelled his name right. anyway its a nice experience. i wonder how long it will take me to study for biology, thats probably my toughest class, coz i don't really enjoy it. i loved it at first, but then i took ap biology in high school, and my teacher made it so much work, and i didn't reallly get to enjoy it. it was not a fun learning experience. well it's been ten minutes, and ten more to go i'm really counting down dnow. i just say that click once to submit button ( click just onece on submit when you are done) right now i'm watching this girl, while i type, write the longest email i've ever seen, and on lmy left that girl's writing one too, god, don't they have somethin better to do? wrong statement, i was judging them, the truth is i probably write more emails then them. that 's because i lived in three different places less than thrree years. los angeles for 13 and dallas for 2, and austin for one month. i'm movin like a train. but. well i forgot what i was going to write, ooopos oh well, i just got off my spanish class, and that profesor was pretty cool, although i understood his spanish better than his english. but it was still enjoyable. i want to join a fraternity, but i'm afraid i wont have time to do my schoolwork. but i still want to be social and everything like that, i guess is just another decision to think upon. oh my god, this girl stopped writing her email! the lab must be closing, nope, its not , just being sarcastic well i've got exactly five more minutes and i'm officially done with my first college assignment. i wonder how many words i've written, babbling on and on is something i could do. well i just got a new neighbor in the lab, she's pretty cute, i wonder if i should talk to her, naaaaa, seeems to involved with what shes about to do, oh well, maybe ill see her around, yeah right!, in this place no way. man i wish this one girl went here, lindsay, she was my high school crush, she was a good friend of mine but i never really asked her out or anythin, i thing she was dating someone at the time, oh wel, thats why i got to be aggressive over here, its a fresh new start. two more minutes left, well i just had to rub my nose it was itching, and fix my hair. well i got one minute maybe ill start on the other assignment, but i don't know how long that would. done ",1,0.784317 -0.038623 -1.752391 0.262292 -0.065767 -2.204462 0.006716 0.378358 -0.470243 0.367577 -0.088116 -0.240538 -0.294147 -0.779356 0.139706 0.0 -0.04277 -0.353922 0.085189 -0.795527 -0.124348 -0.538725 -0.24554 1.283562 0.320303 -0.753332 -1.508811 1.42926 0.138227 0.772642 0.444035 -0.525938 -0.623288 0.190044 -0.521148 -0.779358 0.740597 0.920268 -0.547998 1.013857 -0.039731 1.300292 -1.205025 -0.5846 -0.582724 0.087723 -0.288899 -0.694052 0.448262 -0.687685 -0.020205 -0.535507 1.130887 -1.336409 0.16308 0.499913 0.481494 1.279203 -0.394777 0.86531 -0.983701 2.10899 0.705146 -0.026129 -0.189227 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.656319 3.007888 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.365442 -0.042943 -0.337085 0.802897 0.671092 0.348975 -0.172277 1.101995 4.939042 3.769125 4.518068 4.345336 4.614656,871
"well, here i am in my computer lab in kinsolving. i just finished emailing my boyfriend. i really hate writing him sometimes because he never responds as much as i do. then again he is in houston and still in high school and probably doesn't have as much to say as i do. oh well that's life. god why the hell did i wait until the last minute to write this. i should have done this last week. well, then again i did. but the stupid computer didn't send it. so now i have to retype all that crap again. life sucks! well, it is not that bad, but to me it is. i really wanted to go home this weekend. my cousins re so stupid for not going. what the hell!! now i have to depend on someone else or i have go to their house this weekend. the last thing i want to do i spend a night there with that stupid sima. damn does that girl have a mouth or what. i can't believe that she made all that stuff up about mayur and me. i hope paras doesn't get mad about me emailing about that. god, he believes everything that i tell him. i know that he is wooped in a way. just because he doesn't drive around everywhere for me doesn't mean that he loves me any less. or just because i drive to his house a lot, doesn't mean that i control the relationship. well actually i know that it probably would not have lasted this 9 months if had not driven up there 28 times. do you know how many miles that is? take 28 times 60 miles each trip. that is a lot of mileage that i put on all the cars. i hope he appreciates everything i do for him. actually, i know that he does. he is the most perfect person in the world. he has never caused any grief in my life. if anything has gone wrong it is because of his stupid parents. why the hell won't they give him a break? i mean, what the hell is wrong with them? that boy deserves a car more than any other child. i hope to god that comes to ut next year. that would be the bomb!!! we would be like living together. but i hope we don't break up like all the other couples that come here and do. they have it made, don't they realize that!! i guess being around a person all the time can be a little too much. but that's the thing, i don't think that i could ever get tired of seeing paras. i haven't gotten tired after this long what would change my mind now. oh well, we'll see when the time comes. i hope we're still together then. i really don't know what would give either of us a reason to break up. i mean he adores the ground i walk on and i love him for that. just joking. i adore him just as much if not more. i mean, that's why my room is like a shrine to him. anyway, my time is almost up and i have to go get ready for neesh's b-day party thing. what the hell do i wear? i guess i'll decide in a minute.

"i am in my dorm lost in my own thoughts. my roommate went to houston so i am left here to do homework and what ever else i decide to do to take up time. the tv is blaring, however, i hardly ever watch it. the people next door are playing their music and i hear some bustling in the hallway. the air conditioning is making this high pitched squeaking noise. somebody just got off the elevator. my stomach is growling, i have been up for several hours and haven't eaten. i love my computer. i feel sorry for people who do not have a computer in their room. almost all of the classes ise the internet so it has to be difficult to do much work. i have a really short attention span. that is why i can't watch tv every thing i see reminds me of something else and i start to not watch the tv. i like it here(ut). i thought that i wouldn't like such a big school because my high school was so small, however, i found that i do like it. it is good to have a change. some people think that change is not good but i think even the best things need a change every now and then. i have to use the restroom. the light in our bathroom flickers every time you turn it on. it doesn't bother me i'm just glad that my roommate and i have a bathroom to ourselves. i don't know if i would have been able to deal with someone who does not keep their bathroom clean. dishes in the sink are kind of like that for me too. if there are any in the sink i always do them. i guess you could say that it's a pet peve. burger king ad is on the tv that sounds good. this computer light is giving me a headache. for the past couple of years my eyes have been giving me a headache. certain lights hurt my eyes. it is a miracle if i go a day without my head hurting. i like to drive standard cars. i really makes me angry when people buy a sports car that is automatic. it would be so much more fun if it was manual. i am the worlds worst speller. and i think i have dyslexia. i confuse my left and right especially when i'm driving. it's not that i don't know the difference i know which way to go i just say the wrong one. really i'm just a hypochondriac. my best friend came to visit me this weekend. i had a blast. now i have to go visit her. she lives in jacksonville, texas. never heard of it, well no one has it's just below tyler. basketball is now on tv. i don't know who is playing. my cell phone just rang. too bad they are just going to have to wait i'm in the middle of something. i wonder who it was. oh no my twenty minuets is up. it was nice talking to you. bye.

"i'm pissed. i just sat here for twenty fuckin' minutes thinking i'm all bad ass and shit, trying to do this assignment and all along i was doing it wrong. oh well, i really shouldn't be cussing. i find this rather relaxing in a way. i'm feeling lazy the last couple of days have been very draggy. so right now i'm thinking that i'm a fat, short girl with a high self esteem is that possible? anyway right now i'm feeling let me think of what i am feeling. i'm feeling exited because i get to go home this weekend. i get to see my boyfriend and family. i was just noticing that i worded that differently. wrong it's family and boyfriend. i haven't been home in a while, so it will be great to eat some home cooked food. so do you get some freaked out nutcases in these assignment? i meant to put an 's' but i was too lazy to go back. yesterday i killed my roommate and her soul will be back to haunt me as i sleep. she was a weird little bitch anyway. i got the kitchen knife and stuck it in her head. i didn't like her head anyway. it was weirdish. and of coarse i'm just joking. i am a pathological, no compulsive liar. right now i hate my stomach it sucks because it is so damn huge. you see i'm pregnant and it gets in the way sometimes, all the time. that is why i have not been home in such a long time. my dad would strangle me. yeah so my boyfriend and i had a fling one night, an unprotected fling and this is how i got in trouble. he then left me because he couldn't handle the publicity, it would be bead for him. seeing as how he's a politician and all his wife would freak, so i got myself a new boyfriend and now he believes that the baby is his. men are so dumb!!!!!!!! my roommate is always forgetting shit, it's fuckin' annoying the hell out of me i mean you can't carry a fuckin' convo. with the girl i wish could kick her ass right here in front of all these ugly people. they can't stop me i'm mega bitch. she wants to go into mass comm. this is my message to her ""good fuckin' luck!!!!!!!!"" oh well, i'm calm now. well, i was going to go on but it has been twenty minutes . yes type very very slow.

"we got a new couch today in our dorm room, i think that i like it but it has a kind of weird smell to it. i put some febreeze on it , i mean what can you expect from a 10 dollar garage sell couch. i am becoming kind of concerned about the study habits that i am developing here in austin. it seems that every day i do nothing and at night i realize that i have all this work to do and that i have not actually done any of it. i stay up late doing work and don't get enough sleep. so all day i feel tired. i wish that i had not ate so much tody. my stomach is seriously hurting me. i think that since i have come to austin i am still eating a lot but i have stopped all physical activity. i really should go to the gym or go running or atleast get some of the guys around here to go play some basketball or something. i feel realy guilty right now, i was supposwd to go to churh tonite at 10, but i didn't get back from eating out with my friends until around 11. my mom called me after i had got in and i told her that i had gone at ten and that i was just getting back. i don't feel so bad about lying as i really do about not going. i consider myself to be afairly devote catholic, this is the first time that i can remember not going to church on a sunday. i tried to remember, i was sure that i had missed atleast once before, but i thought about it for along time and this is the first time in forever that i have not been on a sunday. i'm thinking right now how easier it would be to write this if my roomate and his girlfriend were not here. i keep feeling like they are reading what i am writing, and i think that i am right, those bastards, just kiddin they are both reallygood friends. they just called me out on calling them bastards, they thought it was kind of funny. they just put on mtv, man i hate the backstreet boys. and that would be 20 minutes.

"i met this guy mark thursday and today we had breakfast together. i really like him, but i don't know how to express myself around him. i get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. i have a nervous tick in my stomach when i think of him, like now. i feel like calling or emailing him, but i can't find the guts to. at breakfast, it took my five minutes before i could stop shaking. no one noticed but i could feel my knees quiver. school is not exactly what i thought it would be. there is so much reading, and i don't know if i'm absorbing it all into my brain. so many fun things to do, i make myself sit and read. i try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. i try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but i suffer as much failure as i do success. i have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and i'm lucky if i get the times and meeting places correct. i guess that's why i bought a cool ut planner which i carry with me everywhere! my mom was the same way i am. she procrastinated more in college than i am and did very well. i don't want to fail. i think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and i zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. i miss the familiar faces and places of port lavaca. i miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. tears come to my eyes. i haven't cried in a very long time, not even when i came back from the long labor day weekend. when i talk on the phone with my parents i swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. i want to succeed here and i'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. as a little girl, i came to many ut football games. my dream was to be a student here. considering i was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. i love the university and i'm glad i choose ut over southwest texas. southwest does have the best speech pathology program in the state, but i can not see myself anywhere, but here. when i think of that the sadness goes away, but i'm still left with an incredible amount of work that i am trying to accomplish. my dad works very hard. he only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. i can't tell if he likes work. he almost hates his sister's husband. i don't like him either. a total jerk and i feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. i think my dad is happy. he always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. he loved it. he was an average student in high school, most likely had add or adhd. we've always been close, but sometimes i feel like he disregards my feelings. we're both athletic, but i got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and i, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. i hope he knows i love him very much.

"life, was is it. what can we humans get from it. is it just something we experience and can't explain? but why do i think of this? no one tells me to do it i just to it. do i feel like i have the answers? maybe, maybe we all have the answer to what bothers us. can we decide when the hurting stops and when our happiness begins. i guess i'm trying to evaluate what is bothering me now. kind of strange, or is it? the think that is bothering me now is that someone else is going to read what i am placing down on this sheet. it doesn't seem fare for me to be doing this when no one else tells me what they think. so i'm giving my 2 cents for nothing, and to no one so i will think about something else. school. kind of fun yet very hard to do. what should i major in? i wanted to do something with math but now that kind of seems hard, money wise. i'm guess i'm just going to go for something that is easy for me to get now. then payback loans and go back for a math degree of some type. what to think of now. students in my classes seem strange this year. heck i seem a little strange this year. i've noticed that i have changed about the aspects of what my university has to offer. i can see why most people come to this school for, and guess what, not for the classes. i remember reading one year in a sociology class that the university can act as a marriage broker. i see this statement ""seems"" to be true now. is that why i came to this school, probably. i mean i could of stayed in my home town if i wanted just to go to college. would have been cheaper that way. also family had to do with it as well. older brother went here and got a bs in aerospace engineering. could this also explain my interest in the mathematics? and why do i seem to be self evaluating? should i just go with the flow and not worry about the future, past, or even the present? nah, i like to keep my ideas in sort ""check. "" now i'm remembering what my friend said about the buddhist religion and one of the guidelines in it. it basically said that if you get rid of desire, you will feel no pain. kind of an interesting statement. because it shows a whole set of values that you could change, and this would make you happy. now thinking of what my evolutionary biology teach once said. purpose of life is to pass your genes onward, sense genes are immortal. these two statements seem to conflict with each other. that funny. now beginning to think about what time it is. 7:18, only 7 more minutes to go for this rant. well, guess i can explain what i plan to do tomorrow. going to cal class and spark up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex. reasoning being is for ""help"" on the homework, just needed though. i should just do it and get it over with. that approach never works for me, but never say never right. it should be very simple to do if i get there on time this time. getting a little hungry now, but i will finish this, only have 5 more minutes anyways. damn just remembered an embracing moment in deutschkurs (german class) freaking had a voice crack, och. hate speaking in front of others, don't know why. draws people to look at me i guess, and i'm not comfortable with that. has to do with a self esteem problem. am working on fixing that by making myself get use to attention. don't know if that is the right thing to do, maybe might learn something about it in this class. (one reason why i took the class, and sure for some people as well ) noticed the brackets i have been putting all over this. seems like my consciousness is explaining something to me. that a interjoke. oh times up.

"right now i just sat down to type this psychology paper. this is the first time i have ever typed a paper like this before, with constant writing. i am used to gathering my thoughts, thinking before i speak but now i am writing whatever pops into my mind. i am thinking about how much this different from something i would do in high school; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing. i am hearing the faint sound of the houston astros baseball game in the background, i love baseball so much, this the pennant races are incredible. hopefully i will get to broadcast the game i love in the future. well i have an hour until its time to go to work, its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college. astros, i think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out. i'm enjoying the fact that i am able to do this from my own computer, god i would hate to live in a dorm. sharing and small places are no fun for me. looking forward to this weekend, big barbecue put on by my friend mike; we always have legendary times at those. its just starting to sink in now as i hear god bless america in the background that today is september 11. it's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago, it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago. i really don't agree with what is going on in our country right now, by the way. the wind is blowing pretty good outside right now, for some reason i have not opened the blinds in the house yet. i get really lazy when i am at home. anyway, this a little easier than i thought it would be. it has really gotten me thinking. i mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking, and are we thinking about something all the time? consciously? well i think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2, i really hope we don't lose to milwaukee. man i don't want to go to work today, although 4-9:30 is not that bad, better than 12-9:30. i feel like i am writing in a journal more than doing a project, that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page. big props to the person who set that up. i was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment, but i quickly realized that was not necessary. i just found out i have discussion section class for geography. i don't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section? i don't get what that is all about, is it for the ta's to feel important or something? must be a college thing, i guess. it seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now. i just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that i have about a minute left. i hope i did alright on this, i mean i wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts. p. s (i submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code. my class code is 316 not 315) ",0,0.233996 0.066494 0.069308 -0.01826 -0.559545 0.580562 0.839172 0.894688 1.064028 -0.32538 -0.119604 1.04912 0.522342 -0.584519 1.28873 0.0 -0.04277 -0.855061 -0.457121 1.955208 0.044223 -0.207892 -1.466104 -0.376255 0.615213 1.664798 0.58846 1.217704 -0.514285 0.17266 0.520984 0.15252 -0.919942 -0.906028 -0.69198 -0.243301 -0.517483 -0.520246 0.410045 -0.79235 -0.383242 0.106856 -0.9365 -0.566183 -0.688696 0.291222 -0.389587 -0.821518 -0.330846 -0.683429 -0.476429 0.785547 -0.105598 -0.123072 -0.966819 1.077844 0.673479 2.709414 -0.263529 0.106259 -1.187024 0.833583 1.593789 0.198427 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.593967 0.381748 0.262444 1.683221 0.664471 -0.37208 0.651887 -0.422267 -0.853924 0.598966 -0.098422 -0.297995 4.207836 3.812751 4.652857 4.399011 4.930799,2056
"well i have to say i'm alittle nervous about this assignment. writing for twenty minutes continously will be a challenge sine i don't think i can even sit in the say seat for twenty min. but anyways. michelle i hope this is sufficient, and i'm sorry that you have to look over all of these. that's quite a task. i'm in the computer lab and there is a guy using a typewriter . i think that's kind of odd. but whatever. then there is a girl next to me who could probably type 1000 words a minute and i'm over here using my index fingers. anyway i don't really know where to begin maybe i'll talk about the use this exersze would be to a psychologist. i bet you can tell a lot form one of these. people are probably honest and least once they get going. and honesty is hard to find these days. we are all actors on the stage of life. "" i take this to mean, to our outside world we put on plays. we are afraid of truely being ourselves {whatever that means} and we end up conforming into a type of behavior that is acceptable to our society. i know if everyone followed this belief, then we would all be the same. but good thing about it, is we all have different wviews of what society is, and we have diiferent feelings toward that society. such as rebellion, isolation, acceptance, contentiveness, that's not a word is it. but you know what i mean. i do know this isn't crazy the way things work, how well basically the same but we can be so different. it's very humbling to me. to be just another face in the crowd but there is so much there twhen you look at it. sometimes i like to look at life{my reality} as a fractal. if you don't know a fractal is geometric chaos. it has an infinite amount of surface area, so if you look at one point, it turns into another point, and so on and so on. that's what i think the human brain is like. you have human race as a species, then country, then state, then county, then town, then extended family, then nuclear family, then the mind itself, and in comparison to the rest of theat one hasn;t gone anywhere. there is so much learn.

" right now i am listening to a great song. it is a song by bob dylan called hurrincane. i really like and it is a true story. bob dylan is probably my favorite artist of all time. he is an amazing songwriter. and i love how he can play harmonica and guitar at the same time. i realize other people can probably do this but i just love to listen to bob dylan. in this song hurricane he tells the story of a boxer named rubin carter who is framed for a crime he did not commit. his lyrics are really great because he plays with his rhyming and his rythm changes a lot too. i have seen bob dylan perform in three different cities. the best one was in austin. i think austin is just a great city in general. that is one of the main reasons i wanted to go to ut. i really liked the idea of living in austin. and now that i am here it is working out really well. the school is huge but it is a very friendly, very beautiful campus. i am always surprised by how many people i run into in the course of a day. sometimes i hadnt even known that the person went to ut or even that they were in austin. yesterday when i was eating i saw a guy that i had no seen since eighth grade. he recognized me right away and said his name so that i would remember him. it was amazing that he recognized me froms so long ago. i thought that was really cool. and i love ut because there are so many interesting classes to take. i never thought i would be able to take a whole class devoted to classical mythology. i have learned a little about mythology in other classes but now i have a whole class for it. it is really fun to read about all the deities and gods and demigods in different types of myths. my roommate right now has a sociology class about juvenile delinquency. i think that is also very interesting. she is reading her textbook right now. my roommate is cool. i got very lucky with the pot luck assignment. shes from san antonio and her mom is a judge. yesterday i met her mom and she is very nice too. she took us out to a really great chinese restaraunt. it was one of my first non jester meals since i've been here. i don't mind the food at jester. some people complain that jester is gross but i really like it. the people on my floor are very friendly. two girls across the hall always come over and hang out with us and its a lot of fun. i have lots of distractions from studying though so i have to be sure to try and concentrate and actually get my work done. there is just so much to do here. tonight i am probably going to go to hear a singer play named mike nicolai. he is playing at flipnotics. i have never been there but my brother tells me that it is cool. it is fun having an older brother go to the same school as you. he looks out for me. i sat with him at the footbasll gamme and it was really fun. i even got to go out on the field during halftime to help form the tunnel for the players. my very first ut game was a big success. the second half was very uneventful but overall i had a really good time. i don't usually watch a lot of football but i am excited about going to support the ut team. i even watched a girls soccer game the day after that. we beat duke 2-1. it was pretty fun to watch. i love to play soccer but i have not been on an organized team since my freshman year. in high school i mainly played softball. but now that i am at ut i don't play that anymore. i am going to sign up for intra mural volleyball and possibly flag football. my roommate and i are going to try to be on the same team. it should be a lot of fun. it is coed so we got some guys to join our team from down the hall. when i was in eighth grade i played volleyball and i was a setter. i think that will be my job on this team as well. my favorite sport to watch is baseball. i like to follow the houston astros. my dad is a big fan so he has had season tickets to the astros games for years. now that there is a new stadium, our seats are really good. we sit right behind home plate and it is a great view of the game. last time i watched one the astros won. they have changed a lot of stuff about astros baseball. they used to have cool rainbow uniforms and an alien guy for a mascot. but now the colors are navy blue and red or something like that. and the mascot is just some bunny thing. i like the old, vintage uniforms better. i wish i still had my old astros tshirts because it is very hard to find that stuff now. i had a big poster of orbit the old mascot.

"well, let's see, what am i thinking and feeling? my thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. i guess what's really on my mind is this day and this week. it's been really, really stressful. the only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. the week did not start off well, as i lost a really cushy job, and it was just because i procrastanated and that made if even worse. then, i got an interview, off campus 15 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and i had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so i was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where i was supposed to go and was freaking out. i could have cried. right before i was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance i called back a lady that i had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. it was my dream job but i was sure it would already be gone. just my luck though, i impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and i got the job! it was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. so things got better after that but today things were just shit. one of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. my other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. i cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and i hate drama. i guess i can't complain though, my job is great. i love working with art. the lady i'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. there were just a lot of jobs cut though and i feel really bad for her because i know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. but my other co-worker is really funny and i like her a lot but i'm really sad that she might be going away soon to washingtone, d. c. everyone else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. let's see what else. oh yeah, of course boy troubles. boys suck, that's all there is to it. sometimes, i wish they would all just die. or at least those that suck. not my friend da byron though. i love him. he e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :) also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. know what i really need? a break from all people. i just want to be alone. i want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. i want to go to a dig in greece and get away from everything. i hate feeling i owe something to other's feelings. i guess i'm just tired. the minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. i guess i'm just tired of that. it would just be great to start all over again, but i know that i can't regret the past and that i learn from everything i do. i have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, i mean i have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if i do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. in the end, i guess it's worth it because i know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. it's just what you have to put up with. i only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. well, i'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but i'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :) ",1,0.014168 -1.049172 -1.133887 -0.795689 -0.083666 0.339285 -0.061774 -0.281012 -0.276244 0.428163 -0.125684 0.007313 -0.469097 0.177622 -0.958715 0.0 -0.04277 -0.275152 -0.52724 -0.795527 -0.770508 1.053061 0.156614 -0.31023 -0.161499 -0.239749 0.286625 -0.378817 1.378712 -0.550648 0.715117 -0.544383 2.62845 1.957257 1.415467 0.83013 -0.681357 -0.454045 -0.844889 0.070424 -1.038726 0.564334 0.462135 -0.77115 -0.876501 -0.858162 0.74562 0.33714 -0.33779 0.404517 0.602623 -0.951947 1.064619 -0.470899 -0.422574 0.426689 -0.03565 0.139715 0.282504 0.779274 -0.066446 1.514315 -0.480161 1.015838 1.204754 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.423823 0.559824 0.177236 -0.23436 -0.132941 -0.210866 0.216614 -0.422267 -0.142776 0.332658 0.286254 -0.046397 5.030089 4.61915 4.257845 4.376293 4.915128,1710
"i'm thinking i don't know what to write this popsicle tastes good, i'm really bored, my roommate is gone i'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything i'm thinking i miss my girlfriend and i should probably call her when i am done with this the popsicle tastes good. i hear the bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and i think it's kind of annoying. tonight is going to be fun, i am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good. i think i need to clean my room, it's really messy. i need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, i hear loud voices in the hall, i wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, i need to put my papers and homework away. i am going to get another popsicle. it tastes good too. i wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly. i am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest. i'm really bored. i think i will turn the radio on. never mind, i think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness. i hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody. i can't wait for that to start, but i am upset that i have to play coed instead of men's. this other popsicle is really good too. i feel papers in my pocket and i take them out, its my bank statements. that makes me upset because i see all the things i wasted my money on. i throw them on the floor. i'm thinking that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because i am looking forward to stop typing this. when i am done i think i will take a shower, and then maybe, i'm thinking about something interesting i can do after that, i'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that. i don't know, maybe i can figure something out when my roommate comes back. i'm hungry. now i'm eating chips. i'm laughing because i'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think i have an obsession with food, which i kind of do but that's just because i am hungry all the time. i really like the chips. i'm kind of sleepy too, maybe i'll take a nap. i was thinking about typing and how i am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because i haven't seen him in over a year. maybe i will call him this weekend i love chips and salsa, it's damn good. my roommate is going to be pissed because i am eating them all without him. it doesn't matter though because i am really hungry. 2 minutes left i can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but i want to do other stuff. i'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class. i really like these chips. well times up and now i'm really happy because i'm done.

"the reality that college isn't just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that i have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. i think somewhere in my mind i thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there'e more free time. well, i know now that this will not be so. all my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. i'm really afraid that i won't know what to expect on examinations. i've spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can't imagine what i'm going to do. reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. i also started reading my economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that i recognized as being covered in class. i've discovered that going out every night and staying out until 2:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. the first week of school i tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. there are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and ""party"" and meet people every night. externally, i'm a member of a sorority and we're supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. internally, i feel like i'm missing out or something if i don't go. maybe there's a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. i ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of utc that i had met at orientation. we recognized eachother and talked for a minute. a couple days later i saw him in my economics class. it would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. but, great things like that usually don't happen to me. my roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. i really like them a lot. we all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. everyone is so nice and we get along well. i especially like my roommate. we have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. we aren't in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together. last night we stayed in and worked on our psych pretesting which took me like two hours after the ut football game. we were pretty bummed that they lost.

" i wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean. what can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes. i'm not a very good typist for one. none too good at spelling either. i hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes. this computer screne is far too birght. i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this. i wish i could read some other students writtings. maybe i'd find some insight to how i'm doing in this rat race. maybe i'd figure out what the girls around here are looking for. how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it. i wish i were at the lake right now. no books, no tv, no phone, just a hamock and a cold drink. maybe a seadoo. a little bit of water sports never hurt anyone. accept the ones that crash. god i hope never see anything like that again. why did that have to happen, all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower. all they had to do was look around for boats. they could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldn't understand that a jet ski isn't a toy. a goddamn toy! how could anyone play with their life like that. i hope i go in my sleep. i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now. those poor bastards. i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though. i could never live with that kind of baggage. they didn't even know where their parents were. for the love of god, what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call. mrs smith, your daughters are dead. there was nothing we could do, i guess these things just happen. and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek. maybe i am ill. maybe i should get a bike. i could get around alot faster. maybe i should just leave early, then maybe i could loose some weight. mayeb i've got it all wrong though. maybe they don't even care about that. i should loose some weight anyway. its unhealthy. who ever reads this thinks i'm a nutcase. hello out there. welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind. its cold in here, but you'll get used to it. watch your step, there are some loose screws here and there. don't poke at that, i'm affraid it might fall apart. don't trip on that, its allready fallen apart. i know its messy in here but i'll get it all organized sooner or later. i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady. i hear they are very affordable. i guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole immigration mess. maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess, or our terrorism mess. or our youth mess. or our drug mess. who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are. i'll just let trusty george w. handle it. err, imean cheany ",1,-0.756603 -0.730423 -2.019153 -0.784908 -0.350125 -0.19167 0.080875 -0.144508 -0.656541 -0.276154 -0.237341 0.95453 0.588112 -0.145687 -1.03266 0.0 -0.04277 -0.71214 -1.294931 0.549992 -1.218145 0.303384 0.324717 1.024291 -0.017868 -0.167972 -1.59444 -0.457222 0.283154 -0.381851 -0.307216 1.279941 0.847353 -0.43698 0.576564 -0.685711 0.724178 0.022352 0.010019 0.59641 -0.397468 4.032754 1.246822 -0.031585 1.469509 -0.944628 -0.404864 0.414655 0.121695 0.662414 -0.211434 -1.316672 -0.149325 -0.155757 -0.982741 0.100382 -1.515704 -0.954251 -0.591699 1.11495 -0.95784 -1.600134 1.041544 0.177948 1.289556 -0.280398 8.151203 0.887822 -0.225627 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.881541 -0.160806 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.068601 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.431648 4.421222 3.749366 4.514712 4.062673 5.183564,1656
"ow. i just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. i bump intot stuff a lot. i think that it's because i don't pay much attention or maybe because i'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about the wall in front of me. i ramble a lot too and i don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. i've told the people at the management place and i don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and i'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if i don't like having the lights on? what if i'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way i can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing i'm not like that. i don't type as well as i wish i did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. i forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, i hope it's not overdue. i already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when i told him i scratched the car? it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when i messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and i don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if i ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when i know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because i have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. i don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and i don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. i like sharing my opinion. i even like it when people get mad or offended. i don't know why, i just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. i can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid i thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what i think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that i think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but i would never tell her that, and i certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. i think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because i only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if i can't talk to you i don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, i'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be evil, god forbid. god forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. i hate stupid people. i'm sorry, i'm a mean person. i don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. i hate when people ask me how i like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, i hate asking people stuff like that so i don't and i expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that i hate that. they don't know me there's no way they could know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. i am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. i wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do i mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. i don't think i have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then i feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. i think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up ",1,-0.222044 0.604996 -0.417213 0.441007 1.291645 -0.580302 -0.382782 -0.31002 -0.54071 1.670185 -0.169181 -0.240538 -1.760184 -0.725304 -0.913621 0.0 -0.04277 0.978821 -0.736692 -0.650699 -0.952496 2.353076 2.56978 0.780552 0.680906 -0.92789 -1.909818 -0.707649 2.151805 0.67738 1.460503 0.444875 2.415764 0.103711 3.616045 -0.65336 0.429821 1.103394 0.383926 -0.315653 -0.348495 0.184577 0.757106 -0.254789 -0.649424 0.710283 -0.352274 2.597976 0.53071 2.778164 2.014278 -1.171807 -0.809988 -0.128384 -0.927928 -1.087799 -0.323748 -0.182676 -0.858505 -0.074778 -1.411387 -0.684874 0.88477 -0.496789 1.67688 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.099192 0.386754 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.272889 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.837053 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.614319 5.227687 4.013714 4.218695 4.390717 4.984981,1981
"the on e thing in my mind right now is obviously college. i didn't really have to study to get past high school, but i foresee a lot of changes in my schedule, just 20 min ago i did all my math homework for the first time in maybe a year. if studying was my chief concern than i would be perfectly satisfied. unfortunately that is not my only concern. i am originally from houston, so as much as i hate to admit it i miss my home, and even my parents. there are so many things about home that i miss, thing that i nerve thought would matter, things like going to the bathroom. well i miss the past, and i am worried sick about the future. how will i do in my first test? how will i register for spring classes? will i have enough hours to graduate with a bs degree in biology? will i get into medical school? if i don't get into medical school, then what will i do? obviously time is the only thing that will answer these questions. but you can not help but worry about them. ever since i was little i wanted to be a doctor. well not from the beginning, i have wanted to be a doctor ever since i was 11. that is when i had a brain surgery. after that i wanted to use the life that was saved by another as a tool to save other people. there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in me but one thing that has stayed consistent within me is my passion to help others. the one thing that made me feel occurred when i was 5. my grandfather and i were walking down a street when we ran into a beggar. my grandfather had just bought me my favorite kind of ice cream. when my grandfather took the ice cream from me and gave it to the beggar. at that time i hated i'm for it. . but when i went to sleep that night all i could see was the gleam in the eyes of that beggar. it was at that time that tears starting coming out of my eyes. i felt proud that i had participated in something so beautiful. being a doctor to me is the best to repay god, and my family, and those doctors that saved my life. the one thing that i am afraid of is the one thing most people are afraid of. failure. fear of failure has always driven me forward, it is my opinion that fear of failure is the one thing that keeps this world going. everybody has a goal in their life and the fear of failure makes them work as hard as possible. hopefully one day i will walk out of a doctor as a doctor, who just helped saved someone life. . that would be a dream come true.

"wow, i'm pretty tired right now it's been a heck of a weekend. staying up for diana's funeral was pointless, but nevertheless interesting. i wonder if i'll have that kind of burial when i die. i think my grandfather should at least had a funeral twice that size. he was the second greatest man to ever walk on this earth besides jesus christ himself. i'm listening to the live dctalk album right now and it rocks. there is no group of celebrities that i admire more than them. their music has meaning. it isn't just the meaningless stuff about drugs, shooting somebody up, or scoring with someone. it is stuff that is relevant to our world and to our generation, not to mention it is the best musically sounding stuff out there. i wish more people knew about them. i know they would agree with me. the game this weekend surpassed my expectations. at first i thought it was going to be lame 'cause the crowd was soo dead, but as soon as we scored the crowd went wild and the atmosphere from then on was electric. ucla will be a very tuff game next weekend. my parents are coming up for the game. surprisingly i don't miss them all that much, although i do care about them a bunch. maybe it's just because i'm soo busy with school i really hope that my edp paper is not that hard because i lack the motivation. i really wish my acne would go away. i believe life would be soo much better if it were gone. the confidence and social skills would be so easy and fun. i wouldn't be soo much of a hermit. i hope i can get my hair to grow out to the right length and get it colored they way i want to. i also hope that i can acquire the presence i am seeking as far as my appearance goes. it would really be awesome if we won a national championship this year and ricky williams won a heisman trophy or even james brown( by the way i hope he is okay). richard walton did a great job backing up and filling in. gee i hope i make it to class on time and i really hope my future girlfriend is there to ask me out.

"i got very bored doing my chemistry homework so i decided to do my psy. i am very excited about tomorrow night because my sorority is having a mixer. i am a little confused about what is going on with my ex-boyfriend. i guess since that is what i am thinking about i might as well write about it. i don't understand why boys expect so much from girls when they are starting college. sometimes it really gets on my nerves how they expect you to come see them in another town every chance you have. they must not understand that we have other things to do. they are not always more important, but they are things that we are obligated to. for example, all i have heard about for the past year before i even came to school here was how bad sororities are. that is the biggest bunch of bull i have ever heard. i am now in a sorority, broken up with my boyfriend and having the best time hanging out with my friends. now he is telling me that it is great that i am in a sorority, but i just think it is a bunch of crap. he is just telling me what i want to hear. i have done it plenty of time. anyways, why worry about that. well on to a new subject. i love how brain wanders in very different directions all the time. like tonight, i planned on staying in my room and making the most out of my time. well since i love my friends so much, when one of them called me and asked me to take him to his truck, i got up and did it. i wasted an hour and a half just out talking to people i did not know. oh well, i made a couple of new friends. i also hate it when the phone rings non stop and every call is for me and i have to stop reading to talk to these people who call asking me how i like college. what do they think i'm going to say, that i hate it and want to go back to litttle bitty bay city. yea right! i was excited though when my aunt called and told me to come over any time i want to. and when i got to talk to my best friend in the world it was a lot of fun. anyways, i don't even have the slightest idea what i am writing about because i can't remember what i have said. i guess i am getting crs like my mom. i guess it happens when you have more things to organize and think about. i am really glad that my parents made me take typing in high school because i would have a problem typing all of this if i could not type. i am really pumped up about the football game this weekend. i am so glad that a group of us are going. well my time is almost over and then i can go up to my room and mark off one assignment from my list that i made. i am really glad that i am an organized person and take on responsibility well. so far organizing time for all of my homework and all of my social activities has gone rather well. i have not had to miss anything and i have kept up with my reading. well since this is not a grade, i guess since i rambled on it is o. k. my mind is not thinking very complex right now. just very simple no brained thoughts after a very long day of classes!

"as i sit here in my dorm room, i am really tired, probably because i stayed up late doing homework last night. my body feels sore but i like to workout so that doesn't really bother me much. i can not really concentrate right now, but that is probably because i just woke up and i still feel half asleep. i feel very stressed out right now because i have a chemistry exam on friday and i need to read to the chapters. i guess i should not have procrastinated, but i do that a lot. my roommate is actually going to class for once, and i am very happy for her. hurray! i thought this assignment was going to be a lot easier than it is, but i guess not. i am really thirsty right now. my hair has gotten really long, and i am very happy about that because i cut it all off recently but it is growing back. my knee really hurts because i am out in the hot sun, but then go in the freezing classroom, so whenever there is a temperature change my knee aches. my junior year in high school i tore my acl and had reconstructive surgery, so i have screws in it. my roommate just left and it is so hard to do anything around here because she just keeps talking to me even when it is obvious i am busy. how annoying! and she uses my computer all of the time to talk to her boyfriend and it is my computer. like when i got on to do this paper, she wrote that she had to go and she was sorry but hopefully i would be quick about it. i wanted to tell her something so bad but we have to live together for a year and i don't want to make it a living hell. i don't know how to approach the situation with out us hating each other, but if this keeps on, i will end up hating her. living with girls sucks because we are all so petty. i skipped my calculus discussion this morning, but it is my only class on tuesdays and thursdays and it had to be at 8 a. m. in rlm, which is so far and i hate that building! well my time is just about up and i am really excited because i am tired of typing.

"well i was a little worried about using the internet because i have never used before. i have used e-mail last year a little but for the most part this is a whole new experience to me. today has been a good day i really enjoy my monday and wednesday class schedule. except for the fact that i do have to get up at 7:30, but that is actually a good thing because my day is done at 10:00am and i have the rest of the day to do primarily whatever i want. i'm a little worried about the amount of stress that college has been. it is entirely not that bad because i do tend to be a organized person and good with managing my time. although i do have to admit the reason why it has probably been so hard to get back on track this year is because my senior year in high-school i got that little thing called ""senioritis"". i was hoping to be able to do this assignment from my computer in my dorm room, but the communications company has had a hard time getting my ethernet link set up. this is kind of nice though coming to the undergraduate library and getting acquainted with their systems. i have not decided what i am going to do this weekend, because it is one of my really good high-school friends birthday and she is going to school at a&m university. so therefore a lot of my friends are going to go down to college station and surprise her. i really want to go but i want to stay here and go to the football game that is if i get a date. which as of now i don't have one, but i am in a sorority here on campus and we have a mixer tonight with a fraternity so maybe i will get lucky and someone will ask me. anyhow though these little events such as a mixer kind of make me uncomfortable because my boyfriend goes to school at louisiana state university and it's strange trying to interact with other guys. well i think i completely said that wrong it is not hard at all to interact with the opposite sex, but we decided mutually that we needed to try and date other people and not stay completely focused on someone who is 8 hours away. anyhow this is really strange this assignment because i keep getting this urge to go back and re-word what i have just said. i do realize the point of the assignment and that is not what matters. i am really hoping that i have a great first semester at college. i am already enjoying it tremendously but i am a little nervous about the academics. my father will not allow me to bring my car up here until ""my grades have proven worthy"" as he says. i thought that was going to be a big deal but everywhere you go is within walking distance so it truly doesn't matter. well i just glanced at my watch and it has been 23 minutes so i will be going back to my room now.

"honestly, right now that i have this assignment all i can think about is what to write about. i wonder and wonder what i'm thinking but all i can think about is that i want to get this done because if i don't i will eventually get behind and then i;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while i sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. i guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what i am and am not doing. i sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments i need to do and all the things i have to do but i never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. i am so scared that i am going to fail now that i am here because i don;'t quite think that i belong hwere. everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and i am the black sheep. it scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and i don't i just miss my friends that i had in high school. it is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and i have just changed. i wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. my roommate and i have been friends since like the second grade, so i didn't get to meet anyone new when i moved into the dorm. it scares me to even be in the dorm because i am more homesick than i ever would have imagined being. i miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. i only live 30 miles away but i worry that i will look pathetic if i go home all the time, but i so much want to pack m7y stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to hutto. there is absolutely nothing special there, but i miss it so much. my parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when i do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. i also feel bad because i don't have a jobn yet, i have never gone without a job, i've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to i'm a bigt girl i should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. i feel so dependent on them aned all through high school i felt so dependent and now that i should even more, i don't at all. i don;t even know why i chose this school, i think it is becuase everyone thought that i couldn't and i wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. i am happy tht i am here now because i think it is a good school but i didn't have good reasons when i applied and i worry that will effect my future here. i feel lonely being here. my friends are at other schools in austin and i still have some in hutto but i feel like i am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. i feel like everyone already has their groups and i just don't fit into them. today is the best that i habe felt in a long time becausr my friend bonnie is coming by from st edward's and her being here might make me feel like i have someone. i don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. every time i sit outside i see people being picked up to go do things and i jsut sit outside by myself smoking my marlboros wondering when i will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. maybe that will mak e me look important but why do i care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell i am anyway, i think i want them to though. maybe then i would feel as if i was a part of the university. right now i feel like a blacksheep and i have never in my life felt like that. is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do i not make efforts to speak to them. i guess i have a fear of them not accepting me therefore i don't even make the effort to approach them. is the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. but then again maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe i am a good person and then i would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (i feel so dumb writing this becuase i don't say what i feel ever. my mother thinks that i am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how i feel, i create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. instead i act like i don't care either way and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. if no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. only one of my really close friends knows that i do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. but i don't think so becuae i love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who i was then they wouldn't care. it wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that i was human. not that they think i'm, not but i don't show feelings so they wonder what i am really thinking, but if i tell people whta i really think then i open myself up way too much for dissappointment. i don;'t know what to do, i htink that is why i haven't gone home because if i am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually i will have to open up and let people in and if i run home every other day, i will have too much security and i will think that i can remain closed to new things forever. this way i am forced to accept myself and that way i can find out if people accept me.

"right now i am feelng a bit anxious to be done with this writing assignment. i don't think i have ever written for 20 minutes straight and i don't know if i can do it. i feel full because i ate a big lunch and i am looking forward to being done with all of my homework so i can sleep good tonight. i feel relaxed and stress free and it probably has to do with the fact that i have been sitting down in front of my computer for several hours now doing my own thing. that is, anything i want to and not things that i need to get done. i feel good after doing my own thing because i don't feel commited to anyone or anything. okay, 5 minutes have passed. i can't do this. what am i going to type about? i don't know how to describe the way i feel or my sensations. this assignment is a trick isn't it. it is meant to show that there is no way to express them and you just feel them internally. oh boy, i am excited about the coming week because i just joined one of the choirs here at ut and i can't wait to practice. music makes me feel good and i love to sing. singing takes me away from all the daily stresses of this world and helps me appreciate the finer things in life. also, there is a girl i met in the music school that i might get to see when i go to choir. she is nice and i wouldn't mind talking to her and getting to know her better. i am know thinging about maryann. i don't know why but maybe because the girl at the music school has brunette hair just as maryann has. i wish i would have told maryann the way i felt about her along time ago. the choir director is really nice. she took time to audition me with on days notice and accepted me without many questions asked. i don't know anyone in choir and i hope i make friends in there pretty quick. in fact, i don't know many people here at ut yet. i feel lonely when i eay along or i don't have anything to do on weekends. it is different from back home when i could call one of my friends up and we would just hang out together. i am now thinking about my weight. i just lost a lot of weight and i want to make sure i keep it off. eating here at jester is tempting to get a lot of food because it is all you can eat. if i gain weight. i am going to feel down about myself again and that is absolutly what i don't wat. the pastor this morning was powerful and i liked evfree all together. i will probably visit grace bible next week but i anticipate i will join evfree. they have great worship there and i like the pastor. their first service will take awhile to get used to because it is so traditional, but i know i can handle it. i think that church would be a great place to grow as a christian and meet other christians. i hear chris' voice in the hall and i am thinking about him rollerblading and the cop telling him to take the rollerblades off and walk home. that's funny. okay. i have 7 minutes left. i can do this. wow. time flies when you are typing about your feelings. now i am thinking about my roommate mike. i am wondering what he thinks about me. i don't know if he is mad at me for anything or if he likes me. i hope he likes me because i want to be able to get along with the person i am living with. i hope to be a witness to him this year and maybe he will accept christ soon. that would be great and i want god to do that through me. i feel so sorry for bernie right now. she has the problem with aaron and she doesn't know what to do about it. i wish aaron would grow up and realize that he needs to back off. he's been ticking me off lately. it makes me mad when i think about him and i'm mad now. why does he act like a baby and whine to everyone? why can't he take things like a man. all he has been doing is whinning to bernie and telling her how ""he gets lonely eating by himself everyday"" and trying to make bernie feel sorry for him. ah! three more minutes! i'm excited. i didn't think i could do this but it went by really fast. i am not looking forward to doing laundry this weekend. i have never done laundry in my entire life and i really don't know how to. what if i turn my clothes different colors? what if i have to buy all new clothes because i messed up on the laundry? ooo. i'm worried about that. it is so cool that i found all these old nintendo games on the internet that i can play in my spare time. i haven't played some of those games in 10 years and they bring back good childhood memories. my email program just dinged so i have email which is very exciting. i can't wait to read it. it is now time for me to stop writing so this is it. i leave with a good feeling of anticipation.

trying to track my thoughts. that's weird because i don't even know were to start. at the moment i am wondering who just called because i thought one of my roommates would of answered it but they didn't and who every it was hung up. i am also worried about my food that is cooking in the oven. it is suppose to be done in thirty minutes and i sure am hungry. i kind of mad at the moment because the cowboys just lost to the cardinals and they shouldn't have. to tell you the truth its kind of hard to sit here and just type what i am thinking because i not thinking of anything. one of my roommates is talking on the phone and being really loud but she does have a big mouth. she is talking to my other roommate and asking him if he wants to meet the person on the phone for lunch tomorrow but they never ask me but i don't mind because the guy they are meeting gets on my nerves. that was weird. an icon came up on my screen and said my connection has been idle for twenty minutes and will disconnect if i don't click on the stay connected. i guess that means i have been typing for twenty minutes or maybe not. it is weird the way i have been typing for so long and i am just on the second line. i know i have typed more than that i hope. my back is starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly in this chair and typing but i guess i have typed for twenty minutes so i can stop now. i probably didn't type that much but i am not a good typer and i make a lot of mistakes. i guess i'll stop now. ,0,0.506358 -1.296302 0.555702 -1.707944 -2.218531 -2.530554 -0.613393 -0.707878 -1.753726 -1.355349 -0.092581 -0.590446 0.970763 1.220418 0.071916 0.0 -0.04277 0.018901 0.337528 -0.795527 0.141889 -0.243638 0.24202 0.345535 -0.624052 0.748085 0.21909 0.810807 -0.355882 -0.801229 -1.100231 -0.692134 0.37333 -0.011251 -0.409603 0.506887 0.735479 0.7514 0.374984 0.451464 1.407858 1.270958 -1.011965 0.036439 -1.429535 2.450209 -1.093488 0.701787 3.269079 -0.328444 -0.263872 -0.047308 0.533787 0.436416 -0.331296 0.29133 2.516581 -0.954251 -0.046302 0.262384 -1.939937 -0.95129 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.490768 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.142776 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.262055 4.512484 3.969099 4.209468 4.19627 4.666213,263
" i was so excited about coming to ut and i still am but alot of things just over whelm me. for example, people in austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools. basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. i am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example psychology i am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and i am always worried that im not taking the right notes. what it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. i always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. i worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say f*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. i think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. i nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. that really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. i know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. one thing that i don't like about living in austin is that it is so expensive to live here. every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. i really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. one more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. but i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. i wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. that is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. and now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. for example, in dallas she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to tcu i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. my goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. i can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams.

"when asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. let me see. well today i went to this sigma phi omega rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? maybe i'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. during this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. one of the question was ""what quality do you have to contribute to the organization?"" the thing was i couldn't think of anything to say. i mean i am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. i am just me. isn't that enough? then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! how embarrasing! they asked questions that will catch you by surprise! like ""what song best describes you?"" i was like ummmmmmmmmmm oh oh the first thing that popped in my mind was butterfly by mariah carey. i just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though i had no idea at the time what butterfly was about or was talking about. i wonder if they know!? oh well. i've been debating with my friends if i should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. the only thing that i am worried about is will they accept me for who i am or do i have to be the typical sorority chic? and i forgot to mention. pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks! do we have to clean toilets or what? maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the rushees know about it they will think again before they join. makes me wonder what pledging is all about. a lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. i would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but i can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? it's just that some people i meet is just that i have no idea what to talk about, it is as if i freeze and don't know what to say. it is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. i think the reason why i sometimes feel that way, is that i feel intimidated and i feel really awkward. like i do right now because i feel like i am runing out of things to say. actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. just to go to rush events i have spent approximately 8 hours already and i haven't even been in it yet. it was for two organizations. tomorrow is the party and i am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside i want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the club. lately i have been lazy and haven't been doing much but i promise myself that i will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. and if they ever find out i went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. but i think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. i guess going and rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. i know it sounds weird, but that is how i feel.

"right now i am thinking about this writing assignment. i am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort i will have to put into it. it appears to be low effort on both fronts. i have two conflicting thoughts now. on one side the easies gives me more time to relax. it is night now and i am not really in the relaxing mood. i want to go out and do something but somehow i am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than i was living with my parents. my expectations of independence have not been meet yet. i am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that. i tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out. speaking of throwing things out, the trash is damn full. this assignment is already starting to bore me and i just started it. i wish i didn't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that i could dedicate my time to. i find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging. when things aren't challenging, i must event a challenging task or at least a large one. physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed. now i workout for relaxation and for selfimage. naturally i am shy. this bothers me because being shy involves things that don't make sense to me. i really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if i don't remind myself of these things talking to someone isn't a natural reaction. i am pronature in many respects. i am against the taking of medicine to the point won't take aspirin. i am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods. i am surprised i haven't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing i am more surprised at is that i have had none. and now that i think about it i haven't had any for a long time. i used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it didn't matter any more. i got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed. i was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed i haven't. i don't let anything affect me anymore. i have been away from my mom, dad, brother, sister, and dog and i don't really miss them. talking about the past too long also bores me. i like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement. it gives me excitement because i look forward to bigger and better things. right now i can't define things. things used to be money, wife, good friends, and children. i dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear. bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind. i have had a spiritual awakening. i not religious, in the sense i don't go to church. but i try to communicate with god in more subtle ways. i have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen, something good will happen. i never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe. the first night i was here i left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when i came back it had been found and returned to me. i left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me. when i came back for it, it was gone. i emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and i was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars. luck is one of those things i don't have. i would never rely on chance more than i had too. it was not luck my book was returned. i am glad i am at ut or for that case away from home. my mom is very pessimistic and impatient. these thing irritate me to the point where i like avoiding her. a categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in god but they don't truly. they are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me. i have a friend who is always lying. i think he does it to make people envy him. but i don't think he realizes i don't envy people i just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them. my mind is at a blank now. i am only thinking about the humming of the computer. time is up.

"i think college is going to be the best part of my life. coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where i'd fit in. ut has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that i think, i will have no problem finding someone like me. of course, right now, i'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. i really want to join a soroity and become active in as many hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. even though i only know a couple of people on campus, i feel more comfortable there than i ever did in high school. outside of school, things are good at home. i have all the love and support than i can ever ask for from my family. without them i don't know where i'd be. i love them very much. i don't know why i can't tell them that. i guess i'm just too stubborn. i also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. even though i didn't really want a boyfriend, i'm glad he's there. he brings a lot of fun to my life. i hope school doesn't take away my time for him. i know its going to though, ecspecially if i join all the organizations that i want. overall,i'm satisfied with everything. i know its going to be a long and hard four years, but i'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.

"i would guess the only thoughts in my head right now are on weather or not i doing the things i should be. is the sorority right for me? i really don't like my pledge class that much but i like most of the other girls in alpha phi. i don't know i'm just so afraid that i've totally missed god's plan for my life. it worries me. what if pharmacy isn't where i'm supposed to be. i love listening to people's problems and just being there to help them but i don't know what to do with that. where are my thoughts headed i'm not exactly sure i let my though wonder lots of times and they just kind of go in every direction. sometimes the end up to will i ever find the guy i'm supposed to marry? i really do wonder that sometimes. he has to be out there somewhere but where? i don't know. i hate watching emily and justin. its really kind of stupid but its not that its stupid its that i want that too. that guy has to be out there somewhere and i just haven't found him yet but i always want a boyfriends it just seems like lots of time i have bad luck finding one. and it seems that everyone here has one all the freaking time. its annoying i want to find that christian perfect guy out there for me. maybe it is chris but i doubt it. we're just way to different. i don't know. its crazy being here at college things are so different. i don't know exactly where i'm supposed to be. hopefully i'll find it soon. i like the things i'm doing but something's wrong. i have doubts anytime i'm not doing them if that what i'm supposed to be doing but then i'm with those people and i have a great time. it's really confusing. i just need to find that close best friends that i haven't quit found yet. and i really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. i think god is putting me there for a purpose but what it is i'm not sure. i just can't wait. i just hope by that time i'll know what it is i'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. its like i feel sometimes i'm putting on a show. it's weird. i hate that i'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. it makes it really hard to fit in. i just need to find my group but hopefully i have now with joining hyde park. it'll be all good. its weird i think that with all the moving i've done it changes things here because i'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. it's weird. i can't wait though to see some of my old friends. it'll be great fun i miss them lots but then i don't either. i just need to find my new group its what i've been waiting for for a while now and i know that group includes a boyfriend. i guess i'm more ready to find that guy than i wanted to admit. its not like i'm ready to get married just to find him and start getting to know him better. i just want to find my best friend and that best friend will be the man of my dreams who i will marry and i guess i'm just being impatient to meet him. very quickly. because it'll be so neat to find him. i can't wait for tonight because i""ll be going back to church and that's always fun its my favorite thing to do. it's a good thing. and i don't want to go home this weekend but i know i need to so i'm not to happy about that. its really weird as i am wiring this i'm seeing more into me of feelings that i've tried to hide but i guess are there more than expected. its funny i don't know what i'm looking for but i need to find it. i have god and i really want to deepen my relationship with him tremendously. i think i'm on the right path for that. i'll get there soon. i just don't know when. i'm so glad though that i found my church home that makes me feel lots better. really it does. i just know i have a home now. and my impulse group is great. i know that will be tons of fun. i just can't wait until wed when we have it again. i think that will be something i'll look forward to each week because its so much fun. and i think i will get along with my group very well. i really miss my grandma lots. she was like my best friend last semester and i could tell her anything. it was nice and i still can except she doesn't write me long email back. i wish she would it would make it better. but that's ok she's still getting the hang of the internet. some day she'll learn how to use it and become a pro. i know she will. i hope there isn't anything really wrong with her leg. that wouldn't be good. i'm sure there's not but you never know and she loves to hide it form everybody which is bad because what if there is something really wrong. it doesn't do any good to hide it from everybody. she didn't let my grandpa do it so why should we let her do it? not fair and it won't happen.

"good morning. eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours. they say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but i feel ten is a little more at par. i'm trying to wake up so the music of the late elliott smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to. it's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, i don't think i could have got better roommates. i love sitting at my laptop when i wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath. our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying. it's absurd really. so monday night i found out from some of my friends in college station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there. damn aggies. can't live with them, can't kill them. it's a cruel world. but i'll be better off without her i think. i talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart. where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit. but you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face. but i suppose it's like morgan freeman says in the movie seven, ""love costs, it takes effort. "" that's true. back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves. he told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases. for instance alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt. god she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author. but she has no conscious knowledge of art. ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money. and well obviously she doesn't know what ""love"" really is. but then again maybe i don't either. but i know i loved her, i believed her lies. i bought the false love she was selling for cheap. i still love her i suppose, i can't deny it. but she loved herself, before she loved me. and now i have to do the same. i have to be strong and let time heal all. another thing my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing. like i was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life. she had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing. and i quote ben harper, ""so many people to love in my life, why do i worry about one?"" i know there are better people out there so. and i have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever. i honestly felt bad after i chewed her out and she was crying. try and figure that one out. i suppose i'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last. but i don't believe that saying. nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end. i believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them. i'm glad i don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much i enjoy college compared to high school. high school, what a joke. you are not pushed, you are not inspired. in high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd. to conform and be normal. i always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country. but then again i am just one person. so i try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by. i guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace. i try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions. i think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not. for instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car. just relax and roll down the windows and cruise. but if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable. it's sad when people don't care important issues. i guess i just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc. i think life is a crazy thing. a conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action. i think that maybe one day, i'll have all the answer, and then i will die. maybe one day i will find a love that is true. maybe. maybe i think too much.

"i am the egg man whoo i am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and i could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what i was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, i was ashamed. as if i had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. i'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. i am positive god has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. i mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or god? so my friend and i are walking in a park and i said, ""wow what pink skies, i am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, i mean its all celestial, you know all of it """"hey, want me to burst your bubble,?"" she says. ""i know i'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!,"" i said. ""its because of pollution. the gases in the air. "" and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. i wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. ""no"" i said. ""that's not true,"" i rebutted. ""because if you look at the painters of 18th century romanticism, you notice the delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or turner's exaggerated oranges and stuff ""she didn't know what i meant, and i don't think i was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, i guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. i think that if she, my friend, would have told vincent van gogh that same monstrous factoid she had told me, i could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn beatles tune.

"well i'm sitting in the library doing the writing assignment for psychology class. this is really fun. i just finished writing down my notes for astronomy class because i have a quiz in there on thursday. i went home this past weekend. nothing really exciting happened. i visited with my family for memorial day. my cousin was nominated for homecoming queen. wow. not. anyway yeah. i'm back now. it was weird having to pack to go home. i saw a movie over the weekend, wicker park was the name of it. it was really good. i thought that it wasn't going to be that good but i really liked it, it was a love story and i'm always a sucker for those. well the time is going by really slowly. i want to get back to my room so i can watch my favorite tv show of all time. big brother. it's almost over so it's getting exciting. i don't think i spelled that right. o well. this is the easiest assignment i think that i've ever been assigned. wow. 20 min is a really long time. i still have 15 more minutes to go. ummm. i've been in the library a really long time. and i still need to finish the pre-screening survey for this class so i can get experiment credit. i'm really tired. my friend jennifer is sitting next to me. she already did the assignment. i wish i was in my bed right now. i'm always tired these days. i'm liking college so far. i miss home sometimes and it seems like i miss it at the weirdest times but i think i'm adjusting pretty well. at least i think so. i left my medicine at home so i'm having trouble breathing. but my mom is sending it to me so i can feel better soon. i have to go to a ut football game for an assignment in my freshman seminar class but i didn't buy a sports package which by the way i think is the stupidest think i've ever heard of. i think if you're a student then you should be able to get into the game for free but what do i know. anyway so i need to find somebody with an extra ticket that they want to give me. um i like all my professors except my freshman seminar prof. he picks on me because i'm quiet and i don't talk much. i hate when teachers do that. it really bugs me . i like listening to people talk. o man i still have 8 min to go. blah blah. um a little while ago this guy was sitting next to me and he kept farting. it smelt so bad. luckily he left because i don't think i would have been able to take it much longer. well now i can't think of anything to write so maybe i'll sing a song. ""on monday i'm waiting, tuesday i'm fading and by wednesday i can't sleep. then the phone rings i hear you and the darkness is a clear view because you've come to rescue me"". that was ashley simpson. i like her because she has the same name as me even though she doesn't spell it the right way. that's ok i guess i can forgive her. i like her sister, jessica, too even if she is a dumb blond sometimes but at least she's herself unlike so many other people i know that try to copy what other people do and they can't come up with a unique thought if their live depended on it. well i only have 3 minutes left. thank goodness. it seems like i've been typing forever. well my hand are getting tired of typing and i keep misspelling stuff so i have to keep on pressing the backspace button and i'm really tired. i've already said that but that's all i can think of right now. my eyes keep wanting to close. good only one more minute and then i'm going to go and take a nap. o wait i can't. i have too much reading to do. that's all i do these days is read, read, read, and then i read some more. bye ",0,-0.909982 1.630005 0.655244 1.327108 1.081843 0.701656 -0.577475 -0.499229 -0.226539 0.28427 -0.212148 -0.590446 -0.403079 -1.050639 -0.029957 0.0 -0.04277 0.691049 0.873732 -0.795527 0.707627 0.096193 -0.119842 -1.380934 0.348115 0.209994 -1.370746 -0.455951 -0.841322 -0.310633 0.171566 -1.120356 -0.869452 -0.906028 -0.506516 -0.429954 -0.372827 -0.606321 0.049668 -0.4831 -0.010309 -1.092096 -0.294508 0.090003 1.4763 -0.104031 -0.817393 -0.434136 -0.068139 -0.431937 -0.208773 0.684154 0.482859 0.047904 -1.316787 -1.243463 -0.173248 -0.379443 -1.175964 -1.074471 0.619498 -1.054654 -0.480161 -0.375077 -0.178696 3.246702 -0.086094 0.801693 -0.842695 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.14313 0.208356 1.303699 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.360669 4.790095 3.585134 4.967567 4.935987 4.705448,2315
" ever since my boyfriend got this new job as a community assistant in an apartment complex, it doesn't seem like he has any time left over to spend with me. also, since he is a higher rank in rotc, he is even busier. so i question. what's going to happen to us? i ask him over and over again and he just gets upset. what am i supposed to think? every time this happens, we end up in an argument and threaten to break up which really hurts. i mean, he can't play with my emotions like that. it's not fair that he can have me waiting for him and giving up all my other plans in the hope that maybe this time, he'll come see me or make plans with never happens. it's not fair how he can just have me on the side when it's convenient to him. why is is that he seems like a totally different person now. not the same from the guy that i met more than a year ago. how can someone just change overnight? i am upset that when he does come and see me, it's is timed cause he says he's trying to squeeze me into his busy schedule. it make me feel like i am in prison and getting visitation rights or something. relationships shouldn't be like that. it was never like that in the begining. but he says he's a different person now. he just called right now and hung up on me because i told him i couldn't talk cause i was doing this thing for the psychology class. he's mad. but what am i supposed to do? after all, the reason i am here, is to go to school and learn and stuff. if he expects me to understand everything he does why can't he understand that i need to do this thing. i feel like i'm gaining a little bit of weight and that bothers me a lot. yet, i'm too stubborn to get into a diet and too lazy to go excercise at the gym. i am sooooo stresed out. not just from the crap i have to put up with my boyfriend but also because of school work and the crap i have to put up to with work. work does not seem fun anymore. it was in the begining when i first started working there for more than a year ago. maybe because it was my very first job and i was getting paid more that i thought i would be. or maybe it was cause i'm new in town and was meeting lots of people then who are my age. but now, it seems like work is just a drag. maybe i'm jealous cause my boyfriend has this wonderful job or may be it's cause a lot of the people and managers that i started working with left to another state or for another occupation and just wanted to get away. i need the money that is why i am still working there. i applied at the hospital a couple of weeks ago but they haven't called me back or anything. then last week, i decided i wanted to volunteer at the children's hospital and when i called to inquire about it to see what i got to do, they told me that they were good. they were good? how can that be. they're a hospital. i thought they always needed help. and i was going to do some services for free. it's not like i was going to ask pay or anything. it was going to be free. my boyfriend's roomate's mom works there and the roomate had told me that he was going to ask his mom to give me a job and he did and she said that all i needed was to give her the hours that i can work. i mean, i can do that but it would be really awkward in my position because the mom is my boyfriends ex mom. i just didn't want to be in that position you know? and i really need to start working in the nursing field and get out of being a cashier at heb because that's my major, nursing. that's another thing i was worried about. what if i don't get accepted to nursing school next semester? then what am i going to do? maybe i can switch to pharmacy just like what my friend did. but i don't think it will be any easier or anything. it was funny because one of my friends from my apartment complex is also a pharmacy major and was sucking up really bad to his pharmacy teacher so he ",0,1.50486 -0.805959 0.428043 -1.297515 -0.721614 -0.135987 -0.800561 -0.188325 -0.392098 0.553123 -0.140077 1.575018 -1.426877 1.354091 0.19205 0.0 -0.04277 0.430203 -0.476175 -0.401411 -0.610499 -0.550924 1.566442 -0.162189 -0.180159 0.090219 0.025071 -0.701673 -1.15366 -1.357991 -1.100231 -0.296565 -0.182222 0.124387 0.850246 -0.799124 0.145804 2.218351 -0.665778 -0.348414 -0.099573 1.262984 -0.448172 0.144141 -0.63345 1.303813 -0.337096 1.432568 2.087592 0.914491 -0.099683 0.085402 1.870062 -0.072312 0.051449 -0.234882 0.77075 -0.954251 0.919558 1.009283 -0.321818 1.637738 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.125536 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.503044 -0.470981 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.215073 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.530563 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.42648 4.676043 4.23672 4.367292 4.684144 4.309719,1631

"at 855 i should be done writing this paper!!! i am so excited that i get to go home and see my man today. so my body really hurts right now but i feel great because i have worked out every day for like the past week and now i think i am addicted to working out. it gives me such a rush and whoa!!!!! someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me. i hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating. we have designated quiet hours in the dorm and there they go again!!! no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala i really feel like dancing i think it would be cool it is funny how my typing can't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all i can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it is that i have to do it for 20 minutes which i originally thought would be a short period of time but i look at the clock right now and it says 420 which means it is time to smoke. lol that is if i smoked weed which i don't i actually find that to be so stupid. why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life. sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have. psychology is such an interesting major. i just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems, surprisingly, like it will be a lot of fun! i am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that i can cut it i just hope i maintain my gpa and can be like what now! i love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once i finish it is the best feeling kind of like the ""high"" i get when i exercise i need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale i am excited to be going home to see my b'f but i really don't want to see my family that is probably the one thing i don't miss all that arguing i can't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me is my relationship with my man. he is older i know and i do love him or at list i think i love him and i would never want to hurt him , but i am scared about settling down after college for so many years i saw college as being the perfect time to party and meet boys, but now it isn't like that i love to flirt but i have someone that cares about me and that i care about but i just don't know to i want to settle down with someone that doesn't even have a high school diploma. i'm scared he's going to end up using me or something stupid like that. i know that is mean but so far he doesn't keep his promises to me and he lies and i pay for everything but it doesn't matter he will pay me $200 i think i have spent over $1000 on our relationship. going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks. oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 20 minutes of my life i am starting to get typer's cramp. is that possible? well staring at this screen sure isn't helpful at all!! i am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first i have to wait to finish this paper then i got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile. i wonder what i'm going to wear i want to wear my brown shoes but do i have anything natural colored to go along with it i have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm i really should look would white go ummm i need to paint my toenails!!! i can so do that when i get back from eating actually i think naw i do them when i get back look only 3 and a half more minutes i think my roommate is back nope someone else i wonder where she is because her class got out at 9 but normally she comes back early. i really hope i make the crew team i think that would be so cool. i want to make a team and feel special just something else to tell myself that i can do it everyone keeps saying because i am tall but it will be a whole new experience because i know nothing about the sport man i need to brush my teeth what can wear damn i got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that to the list so many things to do this weekend i think i'm going to take summer courses yay! almost finished 3. 2. 1 ",0,-0.846395 0.524463 1.499566 0.25117 0.375095 0.734206 -0.884015 -0.744051 -0.922693 0.753815 0.072629 -0.112239 -0.810671 0.543464 -0.949139 0.0 -0.04277 0.959971 0.758584 -0.425393 0.68581 -0.382778 -0.157556 -1.052327 -0.624052 -0.960953 -0.231791 0.678679 0.230533 0.142406 0.535875 -0.365588 0.19876 0.384258 0.51725 0.05598 0.622516 -0.407997 0.610497 0.695512 -0.15672 0.03563 -1.115929 0.378238 0.314967 -0.103205 0.090455 -0.389085 -0.150487 -0.1375 -0.370816 -0.115337 -1.163538 1.81863 0.273909 -0.530769 -0.660056 0.524675 -0.652196 0.743667 0.761676 0.037246 -0.131328 0.524526 0.400351 1.736245 -0.086094 -1.583088 -1.140785 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.393827 2.388546 -0.337085 0.118577 -0.570218 -0.451544 0.217629 -1.369085 5.183091 4.377109 4.846599 4.98398 4.332174,2366

"okay i am really clueless right now on what i am supposed to be doing. i'm pretty sure we're just supposed to write whatever is on our mind, but i've never had an assignment like this one so that seems really peculiar to me. my back kinda hurts, does that count? plus i'm wearing christmas socks, they are white with red and green snowflakes, but i like them. now i feel weird, like maybe i'm not doing the assignment right, i don't know what to put. i'm the type of person that always likes to have clear directions on what to do. someone tells me to do something, and i do it. that way i know that what i'm doing is right. but oh well. i've missed two calculus classes in a row, and that is got me worried. i'm really aiming for a 4. 0. people would make ut as a school that is completely hard, and all u do is work. and that's partly true, i always find myself reading, and it takes me a full day to finish a math assignment. the weird thing is that i would never read in high school, so i thought it would be a major drag. surprisingly it's not. i don't think it's that bad. last night i was reading for economics, but i was too sleepy and nothing i was reading was sinking in. i set my alarm clock for 7:40, but it didn't go off so i missed calculus. that is got me worried. but i'm pretty sure that i'll do okay. now i have 7 minutes and 50 seconds writing, still not too sure what i'm doing, still having my doubts. i think of so many things when i'm by myself, i go into my own little world and just think about anything and everything. but when i'm asked what i'm thinking, i go completely blank. and people think that i'm just holding things from them, that i'm keeping to myself. maybe that's partly true, but i really do go blank a lot of times. my memory is really weird. i can remember the smallest most insignificant details about something, and then not remember something important that occurred. okay i just noticed that when i started writing, i was sitting up straight. now i am completely slouching, and now my back hurts. i don't know why i said that my back was hurting earlier, it really wasn't. perhaps it was just because i had nothing to say. but now it really does hurt. i have back problems, last time i got an x-ray it showed that it was 16 or 19 degrees crooked. i don't remember which one it was. and that was a long time ago. i really should go again. which reminds me, i need to go to a dentist too. i have not gone to a dentist in about 5 or 6 years. my parents go, but my sister and i have not gone. they told us to get the dental health plan here at ut. do they even have that? i'm pretty sure they do, i'm just procrastinating. i'm not too consistent on my thoughts or actions. i give in really easily to things i wish i wouldn't. oh well i'm sure i'm not the only one. now 14 minutes and 50 seconds have gone by. a few more to write whatever it is that i'm thinking. and i went blank again. well i started to notice my back again, so i decided to sit up straight. i want to go do laps in the swimming pool. i used to be in swimming when i was little, i was pretty good. i remember that i had a swim meet on my birthday, and i wasn't too happy about that. i hated competition. i hated going to swimming classes, to brownies, jazz dance, and especially karate. tennis too. its weird how when ur little, you hate going to all of these things that ur parents make u go to, but when ur older, u whish u would have stuck with them. i was also in gymnastics, but i think i kinda liked that. i remember the first time i had a swimming lesson, i was afraid to get in a pool, so my mom pushed me in. i have class in like 10 minutes, but its in this same building and hey, for this class as a matter of fact. pretty damn convenient right? well now i've taken care of this assignment, i still need to read like 2 chapters for this class and another one for eco. but i don't even know what we're supposed to read. people told me the first 2 chapters, so i guess that is it. anyways i'm done.

"annoyance is about the only word i can think of at this moment to describe how i feel. today has been awful. why doesn't anything ever work out the way i wish it would? everything i needed to accomplish today has been a filure> i can't find a job because i can't get on a computer because me uteid is all out of wack. i miss my friends back home and i miss being a part of my family. they just seem to go on so wonderfully without me. i guess i am the one who wanted to move out and be independent, but it'd be nice to know they all still care about me and are concerned with how i'm doing. it's so hard being so alone all the time. i wish i were making more friends. i wish i would join an organization or i wish i had rushed. maybe life would be more fun if i were in a sorority. maybe i just wasn't cut out for college. i want to be grown up and finished with college and heve my career so badly. i'm tired of just meandering around with no real purposee in my life. i want to start my real life, and i know this can't be it because i'm not happy with it. i want to fall in love and marry and have a family and a meaningful job. i just needsome meaning in my life. i don't know what i'm here for. i know what i want to do with my life, but time is getting in my way and i'm angry because of it. and i'm hungry; physically and metaphorically speaking. this cannot be the way college will be forever. it's so much worse thatn high school. it's so big. it intimidates me to think that there are more poeple on the ut campus thatn live in my home town. i have a class that has twice as many pople than i graduated with in it. it's a real shock. it's traumatizing to go from being well known and well loved to not being either one at all. it hurts deep down and is extremely depressing and discouraging. but i shouldn't let it get me down, i should hang on to the confidence i've still got, because it's the only thing that can get me through ""the best years of my life"". yeah, right.

"as i listen to this music i think about when i was younger, when i had a friend named casey. but is she still my friend, or not? what about joanna, she thousands of miles away in korea. i really don't know what i feel for her. i want to be with her, but i don't think as much as she does with me. i feel guilty, but what have i done to her, i have been there for her, drove her around, let her cry in my arms. i must sound shallow, maybe not, i really don't know. is she the one, i really don't know how to answer this question. what happens next, if she moves back, then she will probably live with me. i don't know if i can handle that. i have started talking to heather, she is very sweet, but is just someone to latch on to or is she really special. it started out harmless enough, but we have really started talking, and i really like her, as much as joanna i really can't say, shouldn't i be worried more about school, i have astronomy homework due friday. i feel like i can almost tell when heather is going to call or come in. right now she is one of my best friends, in a world that is new to me. in fact since i have been here, the best friend i have had. heather has a very sweet personality and a good understanding of people. much like many people i have met, good or bad i really can't say. sometimes i catch eyes with her and my heart takes a drop, a feeling that i haven't had in a long while. that really feels good, it opens you back up, makes you feel good, alive, a purpose. if i do break it off with joanna, what will happen, will that be a big mistake what if she is the one. how can break it off with someone who is in korea, that is cruel, she hasn't done anything to me, i haven't done anything to her though. you get to a point where living life in a certain way or doing something in a certain way is just not right anymore. or doesn't seem right, being or i am really not with her, just doesn't seem right. but if i am not with her anymore will it not seem right in that respect also. this subject is really what i hide from in life, am a an asshole, or i am just telling the truth to myself, i mean after all the school saying or whateveris ye shall tell the truth and the truth shall make you free is the truth making me free or tearing me apart, i think i do love joanna, that is the bummer part, but to go into it with the scales tipped is just wrong, maybe i am wrong, i really don't know ",1,0.841776 0.023864 -0.403271 -0.554515 0.769825 -1.892697 -0.914864 -1.118534 -1.164179 -0.613166 -0.062404 -0.016598 -0.493977 0.564946 -1.263252 0.0 -0.04277 0.681961 -0.134164 -0.479462 -0.270668 0.792939 1.425984 0.178379 -0.624052 0.225114 0.352174 -0.36259 0.34917 0.790699 -0.634529 1.298165 -0.335499 -0.355126 -0.643403 -0.114246 0.216899 -0.638837 0.055224 -0.19641 -1.038726 1.712199 -0.120073 2.213043 -1.003916 2.320469 1.737296 1.086931 1.59893 1.32431 -0.680129 -1.124892 -0.21389 0.995614 0.828479 -0.800831 -1.409578 0.729598 0.299082 1.258663 -0.498084 -0.401682 -0.480161 -0.203077 -0.007619 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.807557 2.744099 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.24235 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.024113 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.436491 4.745505 4.027388 4.363166 4.918541 4.800329,819

"this is the second paper i have written like this because somehow the other one disappeared right when i was trying to push the finish button. it seems like my life is always going the wrong way or i have bad luck such as this for most of the time. i did just get through working out with my tae-bo tape. after completing that i always feel 100% better about myself and problems. i guess you could say that is how i deal with all of my stress,even though my life is not all that bad. whenever someone thinks their life is terrible i always think about those children that you see on television that are starving or sick. i don't know why but i whenever i see a homeless person on the street i immediately feel sorry for them but then i start to think about why they don't have a job or are not in a shelter. my mind goes back and fourth like that a lot. austin has a lot of homeless and i am so not used to that atmosphere, that is partly why i don't like living here. and because my boyfriend wants me to come back closer to where he lives which is dallas, where i live as well. i chose austin and ut because a lot of people told me that i should not go here, including my boyfriend. that just made me want to come even more though, dispite the fact that i could tell at orientation that i was not going to like it. my boyfriend is very important to me though because i have dated him for 4 years and we have a really special relationship. i can tell just by looking at him exactly what he is thinking about. i have never really had that with anyone before and he always tells me that he loves me. i find this kind of annoying because in my family i don't think that my mom or dad have ever told me those three words. my grandmother has but i used to just say it not even thinking about what it really meant. i guess that is why whenever he tells me that repeatably it starts to get on my nerves. hopefully i don't have love issues or something of that nature because don't get me wrong i truly know that my parents love me but they just never told me. i have had a good life so i really don't need to complain about small things. i am in a very difficult spot in my life, college is a lot harder than most people say. i mean i expected the classes to be difficult and challenging but not the living on your own part. i was always so ready to get away from my house and away from the town that i lived in. now i am not so sure about this because i don't really like austin. i believe that i would have been better at a smaller school but i never really thought about those issues when i was selecting a college. i was too busy talking to or seeing my boyfriend or worrying about stupid high school bull that goes on everyday. i should have not cared where my best friend went to school, even though she was supposed to come here with me and then suddenly changed her mind without telling me. i am not resentful or anything but i feel that it is partly her fault, no it's not it is all my fault. i am the one who chose my future and now i want to change those plans. i guess i should be greatful that my roommate is not some freak with earrings and tattoos all over her body. i always think that things can always get worse and if you're lucky they sometimes get better. at least i did not get stuck in the same room as my suite mates because they are kind of snobbish. for instance, if i see them outside of our dorm then i have to say hi and if i don't they pretend they don't know me. i don't understand why people are like that but who am i to make a judgement, for all i know they are really sincere and nice people. i talk about people way too much but if you do it for so long it just comes natural and you can't stop. my room is actually really comfortable right now, usually it is either way hot or real cold.

"well i guess i can start with my dream last night since that is what i've been thinking about all day. it was so crazy. i had a dream that i was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. i open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in. well she walks i and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear. i don't know what she was saying but at that point i wake up in my dream as i'm struggling to move my body. i couldn't move until i realized i was out of my dream, which was maybe 3 seconds later. how creepy is that. when i woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then i completely forgot it. i don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me. i've felt ghosts before but i never felt a bad sense coming from them. weird. i always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean. i mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? i am a little worried about that but i haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone. that i can think of. oh well. anyways i have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if i want to enjoy the weekend like i should. hopefully i will be studying on the beach saturday night. not that the south padre beach ids that beautiful. after going to cancun for a week though i guess its hard to actually top that beach. that was the best time i believe in my life so far. it is good to know that i will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip. saving the money was super hard but i feel like if i really want to do something i am capable of making that happen. i hope this weekend is as good as last weekend. i am going back to san antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit. i really love the night life over here though. maybe because everything is so new over here and i really love change period. i am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter. i came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city. now i know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale. i really miss my best friend a lot though. her and i hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter. she was all i needed and i was the same for her. now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children. its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time. her relationship with that boy is so lame. thank god i have no time for stuff like that right now. i cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time. hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her. man. this is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer. everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much i am typing. they keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me. hahahahahahaha! lets see well i've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find. but unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal. this life sciences library is really nice. i think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here. there are always open computers in here as well. well my time is almost up. my experience in the psy class is very important to me considering i want to be a psychiatrist one day.

"right now there is really not much going through my head. i woke up about an hour ago from a nice, long sleep and my mind is clear. i guess i have some worries about school, like am i studying enough and really am i going to make it, but i guess that all depends on my actions. i am also real worried about the social things getting involved with my school work. there is just always something going on, and sometimes it is hard to choose to study over all of the fun things, but so far i feel that i have done a pretty good job, but then again it has only been two weeks. i am enjoying where i am living, and as of now my roommate and suite mate situation seems ok. it is weird to think that after knowing for so long that i wanted to attend ut, to actually be here going to school and not just visiting. it really hasn't hit me yet, but it probably will soon. it also feels weird to have to pick up the phone to have to talk to my parents and not have them be in the next room or just down the hall. and for it to also cost money to have to talk to the people that i am used to talking to on a daily basis. i also have some scared feelings going through me, fears that most people have. for example, you hear all the stories of these awful things that have happened on college campuses and in college dorms, which sometimes makes it hard to go anywhere alone. you are always having this fear inside you that something might happen to you if you take one step into the wrong direction. that is really scary for me, probably because of things that have happened in the past. when i was in 4th grade my family was robbed at gun point in our house and the threatened to hurt or even kill. one of my sisters and i slept through it, but my parents, my other sister, and my house keeper all had guns held to their heads. no one was hurt, but it was still really scary. then 3 years ago the sister who was asleep with me was out to eat with a friends family and they were followed home and were also robbed at gun point, and had pillowcases put over their heads, but could still feel the gun against their head. in this situation, no one was hurt either. but i am the only one who has never had a gun to me or was threatened, and i fear that i might be the next, and that really scares me. well, my 20 minutes is almost up, and it went by a lot quicker then i imagined that it would, and i really enjoyed figuring out what to right about. it was really interesting.

"i don't know how to start a paper like this but i'll do my best. i really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all i miss my boyfriend michael. he means so much to me and i feel as if our relationship is falling apart because i live a 100 miles away. i don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. i meet a lot of people but i still always think of him. he is so understanding too. he said he would understand if i wanted to date other guys. but to be honest with you, i don't. i know i am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. i cry every night because i miss him so much. i'm tired of crying and feeling scared. i want michael to be here with me but that is impossible. i went home this past weekend and i realized how much i loved it. i never wanted to come back to austin. i hate it here. nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. i wish i could go back home but i can't. i would transfer somewhere closer but i am in one of the top business schools and if i get out then i might never get back in. don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, i am just so homesick. i guess in time though it will get better. everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. it is such a big adjustment to make. i just hope i will adjust. what if i never do? then what happens? am i to be unhappy forever? that is how i feel right now. that i will never be happy again as long as i am here and michael is down there. maybe i will feel like that for 2 more years, maybe i won't. one can never know. sometimes i write poetry to ease my mind. i find that it really helps me express my feelings. whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that i could take? i think i would really like that. i also want to learn how to play the piano. then michael could play the guitar and i could play the piano. that would be interesting. i wish christmas holidays would come so i could go home for an extended period of time. i never thought that i would miss it this much, but i do. i think i want to live in my hometown when i grow up. it is such a nice town. everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. and there i won't be alone. i hate being alone. i'm tired of being alone. i have friends here but they can only do so much. it takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. maybe someday, we can be together again. at least that is what i dream of at night. he is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up!

"i am feeling very confused at this point in my life. i am thinking about my future and my career. i am also very nervous about my classes and how much effort each class will require of me. i miss having the reassurance of my friends and family. people say that things get better but at this point i don't see that happening. i am glad that i came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then i would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. now that i am here i am sure that i was better off at a smaller school. but i think i will really enjoy what i learn about other people while i am here. at the present moment i am having to learn time management. i have load of work to do in each class and i feel that if i am not doing my work continuously that i will fail. on top of that, i feel that although i am spending most all my time doing work i am still not understanding everything. i guess i wonder why people want to give us so much work. now i just heard that on girl that i went to school with just died. what is going on with this world. i feel that more and more people are just dying. how are we suppose to concentrate on work when all this other stuff is going on. now i am talking to a friend and she just told me about what happened. anyway, i have lots of work to do and i have or i feel that i have no time to do my work. i wish i was back home resting instead of here having to work my hardest. anyway, i hope that this year will get better for me so that way i won't be as unhappy. so i guess i should have a positive outlook on life. wouldn't it be nice if everything went the way people wanted it too. no complications what so ever! i hope that god, family and friend will get me through all my tough times. i should me thankful for what i have because some people are not as fortunate.

"my roommate and i have office space"" on. what a great movie. it cracks me up every time i watch it. i really like my roommate. she is such a cool girl. it's weird how things work out. i was really scared about having a potluck roommate. every day we find new things that we have the same. we have the same toothbrush, hairbrush, hair straightener, contact case, pair of pajama pants, caboodle for our makeup, pair of shoes. it's crazy. i really like living at srd. the food was really good tonight. we had this thing called ""mexican shrimp"" except it really didn't taste like mexican. it was just little shrimp in this sauce with red and green peppers over rice. food is so good. i bought some little debbie star crunch and some vanilla wafers at the store today. little kids snacks are so much fun. i wanted some fruit snacks but they cost too much. meghan (my roommate) and i are not having a good experience with fridges. our first one leaked all over the carpet so we bought a new one but it gets extremely cold and halfway freezes our stuff. this morning i got out a dr pepper and it was all icy. we should read the manual and fix that. i'm excited that i am going home tomorrow for the weekend. i miss my family, especially my sister. this past year we were closer than we had ever been and then i had to leave. i don't have class on fri so i am going home to see her cheer at the garland football game tomorrow night. i'm so proud of her. she is so cute and nice and always succeeds at the things she does. i also want to see my puppies. they are the cutest dogs ever and i haven't seen them for 3 weeks. i am also ready to sleep in my own bed. although my dorm bed is comfortable, it isn't the same. hahah- gosh i love office space. the characters are so messed up and hilarious. i don't know why we have the tv on. i am doing the writing assignment at my computer and my roommate is doing pretesting on her computer and we are both just listening to the tv. i really should go to bed sometime soon because i have an 8am class tomorrow. it was easy for me to get up for high school at 7:30 last year but for some reason i am having a lot of trouble getting up for my classes. i guess i am still in summer mode. now the credits are rolling on the tv and neither of us is getting up to turn it off. i shouldn't leave instant messenger up when i am doing homework. my friends keep talking to me but i am doing this so i can't talk to them so the boxes just keep flashing at the bottom of the screen and it is really driving me crazy. the music on the credits is also driving me crazy. there is just so much rap music i can take. oh man! barenaked ladies is coming out with a new cd and they are coming on tour to austin and i am so excited. i love their music so much. i do hope their new album is good because each new one seems to be more pop-ish than the last one. i love their old cd's when they were just in canada and hadn't crossed over to america yet. their concerts are awesome and i will be going to the one here. i should probably start saving my money. i guess that means i should get a new job. all i know is that i will never work in food again. i worked at sonic for 2 years and it drove me crazy. i would come home smelling like grease and who knows what else. yeah, those i'm boxes need to stop flashing. this is one of the most random assignments i have ever done. i probably sound like an idiot with everything i am saying. i really do like my dorm room. it is so colorful and we have so many pictures and posters up. i can't stand blank white walls. the walls in my room at home are blue so being here with white walls is annoying. i should really put some lotion on my legs because they are itchy. the only problem is that i hate lotion. that is my weird thing. lotion and feet. put the 2 together and it is an even worse thing. my sister makes fun of me but i make fun of her because she doesn't like anything touching her bellybutton. she won't even touch her bellybutton. now our room is completely silent except for the clicking of keyboards. i feel like we need some music or something. i'm glad that meghan and i have similar tastes in musics because i wouldn't want to annoy her with something she didn't like. it's been hard finding a radio stations i like here in austin because i don't really know which station play what kind of music yet. i guess i have plenty of time to learn. well- my time is up!

"people laugh at the same things over and over. there doesn't seem to be any diminishing of reward. no matter how long a joke has been around, no matter how old the recipient is; the same things seem to make people laugh. why is that? maybe it's because we like hearing the same stories over and over, associating them with our memories. like ""star wars"". nobody today looks at star wars and says, ""man, check out those models! no strings? how did they do that?"" or, ""man, that hark hamill is a great actor!"" but most of us can remember a time when we would have said that, so we just watch it over and over and over again. nobody would do that with ""schindler's list"". and the fact that schindler is now in star wars just mucks it all up. that's why everyone thinks episode one sucks they're beyond the point where they want to see any more of that. the fact is that they're all fairly crappy, especially return of the jedi. good god, was that awful! but people go back and say it was the best, because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids. come on, ""care bears"" was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves. why did we ever like that in the first place? well, it was the 80's nothing else was on. how did the end of the 80's manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? suddenly, everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science, or at least enough to talk about them, which was not at all. you barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something. i've seen ""very intelligent"" high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues. they bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument, like the bible. what the heck does isaih have to do with campaign finance reform? all the people in the bible lived under a sovereign government they didn't even have elections! there weren't even ideas at the time to compare to these, because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the roman government, and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government. since most of them got ripped off by being murdered, it's not like they can very well put forth a campaign. the romans had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didn't like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of 35. might as well have been anarchy, but then again, you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart. of course, we know how well that strategy worked, considering the glory of the current roman empire.

" why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty and unimportant things? it seems as though when we leave the mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all the more important. when my roommate and i went shopping at the galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present. girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money onto daddy's credit cards. have many teens forgotten about the value and importance of money? i also this weekend began to wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and homophobic. my new friend kenny happens to be fixated on getting dates'girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes him. the entire time at the mall kenny asked my roommate and i if random people were hotter than he was. this relentless insecurity and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining. why can't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy at that? society's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and relationships. most people seek relationships on all levels with people who share the same interests and personality traits that support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that they themselves may not think on their own. why is love and relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen's life. i myself have realized recently that i've spent a great many years in relationships loving someone and being loved in return. we as a society place so much emphasis on dating, relationships, and marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at such goals. i mean look at the fixation that many college age individuals have on dating shows. in high school many an ap calculus class were spent discussing elimidate and the trashy or sexy guys'girls that were on the particular episode. i myself admit to watching the trash, but for some reason society has aimed my eye to these sort of shows. since i arrived on campus dorm life has truly agreed with me. i worried for months that my roomate would be just dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common. fortunately, my roommate and i have a great deal in common and are turning out to be great friends. the university has also provided me with many unexpected opportunities. besides the rec center, i'm signing up for rock climbing, the music school has turned out to be unexpectedly positive. i have played the violin since i was 8 years old . in the past year i have realinzed that i genuinely desired to teach music in elementary school. when i arrived at ut on the first day of school i was terrified of auditioning for the ut symphony orchestra. when i arrived outside of professor noe's office i was greeted by many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me. my nerves seemed to overwhelm me as i walked in the room. all i could think about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me. i felt that the audition went well but i was forced to wait the entire weekend for the results. as it turned out my audition had gone as well as i had felt. i was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st violin section. i can't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting people. alas, i have to go to work and spend my entire weekend hosting, babysitting, and waiting tables. hopefully everyone will come home from college on friday so we can catch up on all the new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other's company.

"right now i am feeling much rage and it stems from the outcome of this weekend. i had traveled for three hours to visit my family and friends hoping that i would be welcomed with opened arms. half of my theory was right. my family welcomed me with much warmth but my friends pretty much took a dump on my face. well not all of them. a few in particular. my whole weekend was, in my mind a total waste of time. my so called best friends would rather spend time with their ridiculously uptight and stuck up girlfriends than to hang out with a best friend. i had known them my entire life and these girls just walked into the picture less than a couple of months ago. nothing but anger subdued my mind for the following three days. i refused to let myself be depressed so i figured i would go shoot some pool. but to my dismay, one of my friends showed up, this one was one of my female counterparts, and she pranced in with a guy standing next to her. so what. that part didn't piss me off as much as the fact that they were at a party and didn't bother to pick up the phone. not even to say hi. she did not even return my calls or answer my pages. to make it even worse, she pretended she did nothing wrong and pursued to make friendly conversation. to hell with that. i walked out of there without even saying good bye or giving a reason why. my mind was filled with so much raw emotion, the negative kind that can tear a hole through your soul. that's when i realized that houston was no longer my home. i no longer had any true friends in the city that i grew up in for 18 years. like i said, my friends had pretty much crapped in my mouth. i'm not sure if they were aware or not but that is completly beside the point. i am home now. the city of austin where i would rather meet and make new friends than to salvage the friendships that i already had. i believe it is a wise choice otherwise i will just continue to be put in such an unstable emotional state. not once this whole weekend i had a good thought in my mind. i was fine until my so called friends sold me out to be with a girl all night so that they could get freaky with each other. i've got no problem with my friends being horny and wanting to get it on with their girlfriends but at least hang out with me for one damn night out of three. now i can relax and look forward to this weekend where i will undoubtedly have a good time while my friends stay at home with their thumbs up each other's asses. screw all of them. i don't need them anymore than i need the toilet paper i wipe my ass with. austin is a hell of a lot more exciting than houston and my asshole friends can stay there because they were too damn stupid to get into ut in the first place. i hope they are having fun at community college, or high school for those that were too dumb to even graduate high school. good luck flipping those burgers at mcdonald's the rest of your lives.

"ugh! look how nasty and scary that thing is. how stupid he was to stay in the car with that object? well this a very scary movie, and the only i have seen in a log while, its my roomates faults. oh, she is a traitor, how about that, never thought it would be her. isn't there better ways to express your feelings, instead of cussing. the monster got her how gross, and what a painful death. it must of hurt, duh, and the guy trying to save should of just left before he became a victim too. again another ironic thing the teams leader is who never suspected. her naked body proves it, why is he so crazy to believe her words. words speak louder than actions. look how she transformed her body and the other one is one of her. man, boy i am getting really frightened of this. my body has chills has the end is narrowing. i have an itch behind my ear,on my leg, foot and head i think due to the fact that i am so scared of the movie and the events that are about to happen. my eyes are widening due to the good guys escape. my head itches more. yeah he made it i'm happy for. there is one for the good guys.

" well here i am sitting down prepared to type for twenty minutes. the first thing that comes into my mind is how slow i type and it is not any easier typing on a laptop. i wish my regular computer was working. oops i just pushed the caps lock button. thats better. i also can't help but think how hungry i am. maybe i should go down to the cafateria and get a quick byte. than again i could just make something real quick that taste much better. geez this bracelet doesn't make it easier to type either. thats better. maybe if i move the laptop onto my lap. eh. . somewhat better. my girlfriend should be comming back soon. i am glad she joined a sorority. it gives me some space. i wish she would understand that i need my space. oh well that will just be an ongoing argument between the two of us. there goes my stomach again. my suitmate should be leaving soon for a fraternity event. to bad erik's parents wouldn't let him join a fraternity. this song is catchy. but it is played out. i am so mad about my car. i don't understand how a brand new car won't start. at least i got it into the shop quick. i hope i get it back tomorrow. linkin park's new cd is so amazing. i wish jennifer didn't give me such a hard time about putting it on. i think i will listen to it aftter i finish typing. i am half way through. this assignment is pretty cool. i never realized how much i could write in twenty minutes. my psychology class is huge. i wonder how many people are in it. it has got to be at least 400 kids. it is so different seeing a teacher standing infront of all those kids. they even have a microphone. those huge projectors that are built into the wall are so awesome too. i hate commercials. . i wonder when i will get to use my checks for the first time. i have never had to use a check before. i think i will like going to ut. its only been a week and a half and i love it. it is so stressful living at home. always having to do somehting. i know that my parents do everything for me, but they always keep me busy. i wonder what i can eat. i wonder how long i can last without eating. maybe jennifer will get back soon and make me a great meal. she is so good to me. i really do love her. i hope my dad gets me those incubus tickets. i really want to go. eminem is always on the radio. . i wonder what he was talking about at the vma's the other night. something about punching a guy with glasses. i wonder if evereybody thinks the way i do. i know that my mind is really weird. i don't even understand my self sometimes. i jump from thought to thought so quickly. i hope i learn something about myself in psychology. i wonder is college is going to be hard. well i only have two minutes left i think i should see what other homework i might have. 30 seconds left and all i can think about is eating. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. .

"there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well i guess it'll give them more to think about. there is this song on rt now i think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot. i love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest british accent. i've been to britain well i mean england. either way i want to have a friend who is british like a guy friend i guess because i don't think id want to date a british guy, they all have gross teeth, i don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something. oh i don't think i've ever seen a british person with braces either i guess it has to be something to do with the dentist. i just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, i have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending. i'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person i am talking to will be like wait i thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then i'm like well yeah them too. well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, i don't think i have a fav that everyone else like and i don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way i absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and i bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you. i've lost my train of thought, what i was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense. my roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, i don't know if i could deal using one of those for everything, i couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever. i think i should get my blood sugar measured, because i think since i have been at college all i do now is eat, and not healthy foods, i have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure. i was just thinking about how i looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, i'm not as comfortable being in one as i used to be. oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team? and i was like no but i think i want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh aren't tryouts this weekend? and i was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you're really really good, i was happy to hear her say that, just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend, i got back to my dorm room and i was so happy, that can also be because i talked to david rt after my class, we are really doing well i think after this weekend, things have steadily been getting back on track with us, i really think i am in love with him, i think the whole break up only made us stronger, that happened the first time we sort of broke up, i wish we could just spend all of our time with each other, i really do miss him a lot, and the thing is if we hadn't broken up this summer i wanted to break up with him before we started college because i wanted to date other people, but the truth is i've only been comparing other guys to him, i guess that's what happens, i mean i have seen cute guys but i haven't really met any yet, so i don't know if that's a good ting or not, anyway david wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because i can't really trust him and neither can my parents, so that really sucks because i really do still want to be with him but my mom is like seville your a fool and blah blah and sometimes i feel like i kind of am because i start to doubt myself so much about the decision i'm making about us, its like would i follow my heart or mind? it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that's really how i feel, i think things are looking up and i think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind's ",1,0.188259 0.043478 -0.579308 -0.004512 -0.078378 0.06614 -0.488527 -0.976003 -1.000753 1.102187 0.504532 1.941237 -1.298923 -0.731982 -0.728143 0.0 -0.04277 0.684311 -0.018812 1.045723 0.261756 0.721196 0.41363 -0.414871 0.507115 -0.412765 -0.47134 -0.577867 -1.110212 -0.637948 -0.113697 -0.708244 -0.904352 -0.614273 -0.621233 -0.582337 -0.346234 0.512996 -0.106711 -0.501277 -0.240982 0.118651 -0.863265 0.459179 -0.0771 0.875217 -0.23682 1.105815 0.594923 1.059879 0.595425 -1.222493 0.908622 -0.112975 0.085287 -0.885857 0.334909 -0.954251 -0.516269 0.014943 -0.41274 -0.330745 -0.164654 -0.170989 -0.261269 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.91461 0.86196 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.027166 -0.37208 -0.186634 -0.422267 0.260932 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.92072 5.103636 3.849561 4.84608 4.779384 4.858464,2219
"ok so i'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again i love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking. so this is kind of fun. i just wish that my strep throat'tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (thursday) i can do well in the challenge. and so that i can play well for the clarinet sectional friday night, because i need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, i haven't memorized all of it yet. i guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) i was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't i love watching. i really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because i feel like i'm a cheap addition to the band. like i wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that i'm good enough because i'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. i feel bad for thinking this but i kind of want kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. i don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because i put some pants on. do i smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good. maybe gina and i shouldn't leave the towels over the vent. even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through. oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its january, not september! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome. i was warm the entire night, and when i got hot i just kicked the covers off until i got cold. i guess the fact that i was wearing his pajama pants helped. no nothing happened. he's a really good guy. a christian. his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex. it has to deal with a unicorn. yeah i wont go into details. but it proves that he's a good guy. not to mention i spent both friday and saturday nights at his place. he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks i trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'. if only he knew me better, he would know that i'm very skeptical with guys. especially after so many of them lying to me. i'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so i basically play hard to get. i don't think id consider it that, but i don't go easy on them. i'm not the stupid blonde you think i am. i really wish i was one or two steps up on the ladder. my whole life i felt like i wasn't quite good enough. i never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at ut, and wasn't elected as newman representative. i don't understand it. i work my ass off to do the best i can, but that never seems to be good enough. why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if i had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did i all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still. i did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school. but once i hit algebra 2 and precal, shit hit the fan. i just hope i don't have to take calculus in college. but since i don't know what i want to do, i may have to. i really need to get that career test done. i've got to figure out what i want to do with myself by next semester. unless i stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste. not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that. i don't know what i want to do. what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes i guess, but that's not me. i'm coming in with so many hours that i was hoping to graduate in 3 years. that way if i go to law school i can get in and out before i'm 30, ugly, and still single. i hope i meet someone up here. i'm not built to be single or to date for years to come. ahh nose needs to stop itching. why the heck do i have to be sick? i hate this! once hell week was done i got sick. yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good. let me tell you. oh well. at least i did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit. and before my parents decided to come in. dangit! rustin has a kappa kappa psi thing at 8am sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game saturday night, which means i wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour. oh but maybe after we paint his living room on monday i could stay over. i don't have a class until 12:30 so that might work! jeez i'm a dork. i need to stop reading into things like this. the time will come when it decides to come. until then i got to sit back and watch things happen. oh look, i have 10 seconds left. dang ",1,-0.170748 0.82001 -1.120073 0.79832 0.421143 -0.55147 -0.402896 0.839759 -0.662716 1.541438 -0.175666 0.459276 -0.519472 -0.63157 -0.421331 0.0 -0.04277 -0.972856 -0.473518 -0.496744 -0.633368 -0.306961 0.02514 -0.091034 0.722026 0.171968 0.485413 -0.02112 0.348635 0.69204 -0.659994 0.288996 -0.228657 -0.906028 0.75242 -0.874159 0.161654 0.244095 -0.645792 0.54656 1.809197 -0.43301 -0.686036 -0.930777 -0.423669 -1.210663 0.053368 -0.493089 -1.144688 -0.324724 -0.086196 1.327676 0.261155 -0.665712 -0.50514 0.551009 1.758588 0.637525 -0.074817 0.02861 -0.849527 0.099247 0.646192 0.27976 0.472626 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.147147 0.532266 0.017596 -0.23436 0.601387 0.448931 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.610142 1.260037 0.265427 0.48875 4.941358 3.679381 4.775091 4.672581 4.795492,2226
" hi, well. i'll start out by introducing myself. my name is christina acevedo. i am a freshman here at the university of texas. just recently i got off the phone with my girlfriend. aahhh. i love her soo much. we have been together for 4 years and 8 months already. except, just two nights ago we had a little argument, or should i say miscommunication . she told me some things that i really didn't enjoy hearing, and of course, i got upset. and reacted. at that point i didn't really feel like talking to her the rest of the night, or even the next day. but i fell asleep thinking about it. which wasn't really smart because it made me even more mad. so, that morning i woke up at 8:00 am to go to my first class. it was one of my farthest classes, so of course i had more time to think. after that class, i came home and wrote her an e-mail. i was so confused and i had so many mixed feelings towards her. i wasn't sure what was going on. just that i loved her and that i still wanted to be with her. well, needless to say, we talked about it afterwards. and of course, we're still together. thank god!! :) so everything is going really well right now. and i'm glad because we don't live in the same city either, so its not that easy. i come here to ut and she goes to a&m in college station. and i have to admit, long distance relationships suck, but when it comes down to those one or two or three weekends out of the month that you get to see each other, they're great! and i guess that's it for that subject. right now i'm watching shop til you drop. i remember watching this show and supermarket sweet a really long time ago. so, they're probably all reruns. right after i get through with this i am going to go downstairs and have dinner. i'm pretty hungry even though i just had a couple of snacks up here in my dorm. i live at the castilian. it is really a neat place. and it is a convenient location for me because my classes don't seem to be so far. my parents didn't let me bring my car over here to austin my first year. i was pretty bummed out about that, but i wouldn't have used it to drive to school anyway. it would be parked here in the castilian's garage, which by the way, costs $900 for the two semesters. although, it would come a lot in handy on the weekends when i wanted to go out and hang out with my friends, or to go and visit my girlfriend in college station. speaking of which, i saw her this past weekend. (labor day weekend). me and a friend of mine left here on saturday morning, it took us about an hour and a half to get there, and then we drove back and partied here. it was a blast! although my girlfriend got a little carried away drinking and ended up throwing up for some of the night. but it was ok because she was really fun before we went to bed. we also tried going to a club called boyz cellar, but my friend (robyn), the one who picked me up, is 17. so they didn't let her in because you have to be 18, so of course, none of us went in. that pretty much sucked because i was really looking forward to that. i guess we'll just wait for another good weekend and we'll all go because her birthday just so happens to be about two weeks from now. and now about school. let me tell you, the classes here at ut are not going to be anything easy, thats for sure. i am taking 6 classes (15 hours). i am trying to major in biology, but. my strong point is absolutely not biology. and thats because this semester i am taking biology 211, biology 212, chemistry 301, calculus 408k, cardiovascular and weight training, and of course, psychology with you. so, i'm looking forward to a pretty tough semester. i just know that i have to study a lot and listen in class and take good notes and hopefully everything will go my way. i don't really want to start off bad because it is not a good impression on the professors or anybody who is looking for someone to fill a job opening. my goals for the future would have to be that i want to live with my girlfriend, somewhere very nice. and i want to be someone that makes pretty good money. and i want to have a couple of pets. not too many. and i know that my girlfriend wants a lot. she probably has been planning some part of her future in her mind. like, at least what kind of house she wants, or something of that sort. i mean, she already has the exact ring that she wants when she gets married. she wants it to be white gold, with a big rock on it. sounds pretty simple, doesn't it?! :) so yeah. and. well, i think my parents are going to come up and visit soon. i really didn't want them to come up here, i'd rather go down there. because i think that maybe i would feel awkward having my entire family in my dorm for a while. and then hanging out with them here on the weekend. i think i would be too tempted to just be like, ok. well, i'll see you tomorrow afternoon, and go out to a club or something. but, well. that's all for now. i can't really think of anything else to type. my mind has totally gone blank. i have typed everything that i am thinking and maybe even everything that i have thought about the entire day. well maybe a few exceptions. and the time and minutes on top don't seem to be moving at all. i don't know exactly how much time i have left to type. but the twenty minutes have seemed to go by pretty fast.

"i wondering about what i should write here but i know that i'm just supposed to write what comes to mind. i just ate a chocolate cookie and now i'm craving some milk. my nose itches. i can see my shadow on the wall in front of me because of the light behind me. this chair is really uncomfortable. i need to buy a pillow to fit in it. now i'm drawing a blank. now i'm thinking about studying chemistry after i finish typing. but i don't understand the work, so i guess i should just wait and do the homework after i go to the discussion session tomorrow. my chemistry professor was ""sick"" today, but the sickout is not supposed to start until tomorrow. maybe she really is sick. my arm hurts because the edge of the desk is sharp. now my back itches. it's this darn chair that's making me so uncomfortable. now i'm wondering if it matters if i type contractions or not. i know that in a proper english paper, i am not supposed to say ""isn't"" or ""i'm"" or anything like that. but this is a stream of consciousness so i guess there aren't any rules. i wonder when my roommate is going to get in tonight. i hope she doesn't walk in while i'm still typing this, then it will distract me. but then again, i'm not doing a very good job at focusing on my thoughts right now, anyway. hmmm. my thoughts. i wish i had not just eaten that cookie. that's unnecessary calories and now i'm thirsty. i wish i could talk to this guy that i like, j. j. he's on a sixmonth float for the navy and i won't get to see him until spring break. but we care a lot about each other and email everyday. i wish i had some music on right now, but i don't know if i should listen to music right now, anyway, because that might mess up my thoughts, also. i hope i like this psychology class. i'm thinking about being a child psychologist. i love children. i want to have two kids. i think i want to have kids before i'm oh, 26. i don't want to die before my kids graduate. larry king is 74 and his wife is pregnant. that's ridiculous. that's traumatic on the child, i think. i just popped my knuckles. my mom would always slap my hands when i did that in front of her. my nose really itches. sitting here makes me notice all my aches and pains. my ankle hurts and my arms are hurting because of this desk. i need to repaint my toenails, but i'm so lazy. i want to go smoke a cigarette outside really quickly. but i only have 15 more minutes to type. wow, only one fourth of the time has passed so far. i just popped my neck. that's probably not too good for me. i'm going to have arthritis everywhere by the time i'm 30. now i'm trying to get more comfortable so i'm sitting indian style in this little bitty chair. my closet light is on and it's kind of bothering me. i hope i do well in all of my classes this semester. my easiest class is german but the rest i know i will have to put forth a lot of effort to do well in them. but i really think i'm going to enjoy this class. the first day i walked into psychology class last wednesday, out of all the people in the auditorium, i happened to sit right next to someone i had met the night before. it really is a small world, even thought this is the biggest college in the nation right now. my roommate is a raver. she has all of these rave flyers all over the wall. i've never been to a rave, but i think i might go to one this saturday. i'm not too pumped up about it, but i think i should at least give it a chance. i just hope i don't get drugged accidentally or something. and also, ravers wear really funny clothing. i'd look funny if i wore ""normal"" going out clothes to the rave, so i'm going to have to borrow my roommate's clothes. okay, time is up.

"in this present moment i feel slightly irritated due to the fact that earlier today i was not able to surf the internet on america online. the problem of surfing the internet could have been easily solved by going to a computer lab in my dormitory(jester) and logging on to the internet from there. however. my focus was to locate some friends on the internet. this feature is exclusive to america online and not possible to achieve in the jester computer lab. ultimately i gave up and now i am in the process of typing this 'stream of consciousness'. another issue on my mind. even though it may sound trivial is table tennis. earlier in the day my friends and i were unable to get an open table which irritated me. truthfully, i will admit that i am fairly easily irritated. i think that a large blame on this problem rests on my tendency to be a perfectionist. when things do not get done, or do not get done the way that i want. i get really irritated. on a good note, one good aspect about myself is that i realize my shortcomings. i am trying my best to overcome these bad tendencies that i have. in my opinion, college means to me a clean slate in which i can start over. i am trying my best to get off and remain on the right foot. one of my foremost goals is to meet new colleagues and friends. friendship is very important to me. without friends. the road of life would be lonely indeed. whether these friends are so called 'e-friends' that i keep in touch with over the internet, or friends i know in person. they are equally important. while i am on the 'e-friend' topic. i feel compelled to mention an incident that happened to me on the internet. i met a nice female an america online. considering that america online is the largest internet provider in the world. i was very surprised that this person happened to live in close proximity of me. we set up a rendezvous at a coffee house in which we met in person. we had a good time. this just shows how the world is smaller than it seems. in addition. i also keep in touch with e-friends in such places and germany and singapore. it is very interesting to converse with them. as you can probably tell. i am very much a technophile. i love anything electronic and i especially love computers. but of most importance to me as i mentioned already are friends. i guess i could say the prevalent topic in this 'stream of consciousness' is friendship. to tell the truth. if any of my e-friends were severed from my acquaintance, be it by losing touch or just plain not talking to me any more, i would be extremely upset. however. i know it cant last forever. sometimes it seems that nothing will last forever. i guess sometimes we just have to move on.

"i am thinking back to when in class you were talking about sitting in front of the computer and wondering what to write about. i wonder what my roommate is saying ?hmmm? for. she may think it is weird that i am writing about her if she reads this. i like rice krispie treats. i just had one. i went to the vegas getaway for the business school; it was fun. my face is itching. my nose, then my neck. i really like what i've done with my hair today, but too bad it took longer than i had expected it to take. my roommate, erika, is leaving. she is going to go get something to eat. now my back is itching. i wonder why, when you itch, simply rubbing on the itching spot doesn't make the itch go away. you have to scratch it instead. wouldn't it be easier if we just didn't itch at all? i mean, what's the point of itching anyway? i guess it just makes the experience of life all the more interesting. also why is it that when you start to itch, you suddenly itch everywhere. kind of like when someone yawns and you see it, it makes you have to yawn too, even if you're not sleepy. i'm spending an awful lot of time thinking about itching. i want to take a speed reading class at the utlc. maybe it will help me in the future. but will i begin to speed-read everything if i take the course?. i like listening to music. i guess most people do really. my nose itches again. i'm glad it got cooler in this dorm room. last week it was so hot. i had to sleep on top of my blanket. the good thing is that it therefore provided more padding on these rock-hard beds. i really like the movie chicago. it's so theatrical. speaking of which, i think my sister had auditions for the high school's fall play today. i wonder how she thinks she did. i hope that she gets a part, even if it's a small one. i'm looking forward to seeing the fall production. maybe they'll make it to state oap this year. i miss being in theatre. i would like to join a theatre club, but i'm not sure i have time for the rehearsal commitment. plays are a lot of work. i really like this writing assignment you all have devised for us. it's interesting and even kind of fun. i like the box i have on my shelf. it's orange and gold, with a leaf pattern. thank goodness i only have 2 classes tomorrow. today was nonstop; 4 classes with only a 30 minute break. i had a bagel for breakfast. i wonder how early the bagel guy has to get up in order to go to his little stand and be open in time for 8 o'clock classes. i wonder if he likes his job?. he would get to meet and see a lot of people every day; that, i'm sure, is a perk or he would not be living in austin, or any big city. i'm from a small town. austin still continues to wow me with the massive number of people on campus and on the streets. oh good i get to put my pennant that i bought today up on my board in about 5 minutes. it cost $7. one about 1'3 of the size cost $6. they're probably betting on the idea that people will not check the price of both pennants and simply buy the smaller one, thinking it will cost much less. i had economics today. i think i'm beginning already to think more about the economy. at least i hope so, because if i am, that means i'll do better on the tests. there is a study session tomorrow night that i'll be attending. i need to go running later. i'm really glad that the gym is so close by. in my hometown, you had to drive 35-45 minutes just to get to a gym. so it was either waste all that time, or go run on the hard, uneven, gravel-y, county road. gravel-y is not a word but that's okay. i wonder what psychological experiences you all will get by reading these assignments. 5 seconds left. oh okay my time is up but i get to finish my thought. i'm going to go study now. i have to read my psych book for your class tomorrow.

"it feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down. not too badly upside down, but it is definitely different. i had friends come home this weekend and i loved seeing them, but i also realized that college is different for all of us. i noticed changes in my friends that didn't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there. i loved having friends home, knowing i had people to go out with and overall just having a blast. but- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left. i love college and all the new people i've met- i just haven't had the time yet to make the kind of friends i had in high school. i understand this, but it's frustrating to go from always having 10 people to call and talk to down to maybe 4 or 5. i met some people at the longhorn game on saturday and it was awesome! i just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough i will have those close friendships with people in college. my friends and i also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to west point. i've realized that i miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss. in so many ways i wish he were here but i know that wouldn't be right. it doesn't make it any easier, just a little bit more complicated. i'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year. i feel like out of 50,000 students, i am the only one staying at home with my parents. in so many ways it's not too bad, but when i go out with friends and they can do whatever, come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom i'm missing out on. a lot of it is that i am sad that i don't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way. it's also hard because so many of the people i am friends with are all living on campus and so it's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them. anytime i have to come up to campus it's at least 20 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place. it just sucks because that's really the only thing i don't like about my college experience so far. it always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because i don't have that. this is an awful long time to write. i don't really know what else i have floating around in my head and i still have 10 minutes. school work is starting to kind of scare me. it's like oh i have a test in 3 weeks so i don't need to worry about it now and then i know that all of a sudden 3 weeks are going to have passed and i'm not going to be prepared. i love not going to all of my classes everyday. it makes it seem less difficult. the one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that i have these huge breaks between classes. on wednesdays and mondays i have 3 hours between classes and 1. 5 between 2 others. the worst part is that i don't know what to do with the time and i can't go to my dorm because i don't have one. i'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment isn't to explain your feelings about college because that's what i've done in this one so i might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time. i'm listening to the titanic soundtrack right now. i've been listening to it a lot lately. i think it's because it's pretty relaxing and it calms me down. the music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie. i went to see titanic twice. the first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie. it totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well, you can just imagine. 5 more minutes. i'm really glad that i didn't have to work today. i feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday. i work up at the recreation center on campus and i love it. the people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age. this summer when i worked there, there was no one under the age of 21 except for me. it made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that i had no idea about and won't for at least another 3 years. one of my friends from high school works there and i like having her there. i hate the fact that we don't work together, but hey that's the way life goes. i wish i had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus. two more minutes. i never realized how long 20 minutes could be. i've found email to be quite handy with friends because i can email my side of a conversation in about 5 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter, putting it into the mail and sending it. i have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because i have to go all the way to the post office. whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job. well looks like my time here is done. i guess i have one more to do but not until tomorrow.

"ok i have to type for twenty minutes straight. this is kind of odd, i've never done anything like this before so i don't quite know what to do! i should be doing my economics homework but forget it, i'll do it later. i don't even understand it anyways. calculus is a pain in the back too, i'll wait until monday to do that homework. i can't wait to go home this weekend and see all my old friends. it's been a while since we've all hung out. i hope i don't miss any really good parties this weekend, but i probably will. in a little while i have to go take a shower and get ready to go out with the girls at the house. we'll probably go to 6th street or something like that. i'm glad i finally get to go out tonight, i've been sitting in my room for a week straight. ok i'm bored and am running out of things to say already. i have nothing else to think about right now! full house is on the tv and i'm getting annoyed with michelle whining. why is the tv on this channel anyways? i guess my roommate put it on. i'm glad she's gone right now. i needed some peace and quiet. i'm getting real hungry i hope danielle wants to go eat soon. gosh i still have another load of laundry i have to do before i leave tomorrow. i get to sleep in until one tomorrow because i don't have class until 2. that rocks. my room is so messy but i'm way too lazy to clean it right now. it's dusty more than cluttered. oh well, i'll get over it. hold on my phone is ringing. it's my boyfriend matt just saying hi as usual. i wish i saw him more. it's a lot easier now that i'm in austin but it's still not the same as living in the same town. oh i totally forgot that he can't go to san antonio this weekend, looks like i'll be without him again. i really need to catch up with some of my old friends this weekend. we need to party and hang out like we used to. i might end up going to the high school football game if there is nothing else to do. i just don't want to look like a hasbeen with a bunch of high school students and then a college student just chilling out there. ha ha that might be pretty funny actually. i'll get robyn to come with me so i don't feel too stupid. oh i like this song. i wanted to go to the concert but the tickets were all sold out. speaking of tickets i never did get the dave matthews tickets for the september show in houston. i can't believe i forgot to get them. now i'll never get tickets. looks like i'll miss out on yet another awesome concert. at least i'm in austin now. no good bands come to san antonio, so i'll get to go to plenty of concerts here. i still haven't gotten my stupid ethernet card yet. i went to the computer store earlier but they didn't have any more for laptops. this stupid thing isn't worth all the trouble! this song is so annoying. i need to find that remote control right now. much better. i think this is matt's cd. he has plenty of mine so it's ok if i don't give this back for a while. he won't miss it. ok i really am so bored and hungry it's unreal. i need to take a shower but i'll just wait until this thing is done. two more minutes. i can do that. i want to go dancing tonight. that sounds like fun. none of my friends back in sa want to go so i'll find some of the kd's to go with me. my room is so crowded with pointless junk. i should take some of it back home this weekend but i probably won't just because i'll forget or something will come up. i need to get this roll of film developed sometime soon so i can put some new pictures up. i'm sick of looking at all these old ones. well my time is just about up for this thing so bye bye for now!

" well here i am, just sitting and typing. i've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - i've got class til 7, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week! hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me? thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 8 (or 9?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 05 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big l-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that maggie (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong! maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that i've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 1) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 2) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 2 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 1) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 2 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she has her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows! im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never ",1,-0.095343 -0.431067 -1.068458 0.129253 0.410655 -1.862781 0.295243 -0.191493 -0.37548 1.469492 -0.114069 0.103725 -1.310176 0.498752 -0.421692 0.0 -0.04277 0.933885 -0.677549 2.093783 -0.151027 -0.446894 2.202334 0.587839 0.403602 0.093967 -0.945256 0.226242 0.138137 0.010205 0.916347 -0.555534 0.208289 -0.375915 -0.116903 1.284499 0.891718 0.933354 1.099398 0.763178 -1.038726 -0.39048 1.989875 1.164016 0.823036 1.32984 -0.120644 1.740689 0.922084 2.33998 0.096827 0.203175 4.824686 -2.338737 -0.618909 -0.486345 -0.577397 0.26098 0.761533 0.931415 -0.968726 0.706321 -0.193525 0.298132 -0.027967 0.548138 -0.086094 -0.569714 2.037385 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.080301 0.224868 1.4398 -0.422267 -1.050838 3.61373 1.306938 0.63166 4.747247 3.887565 4.56759 4.544108 5.301612,1857
"i finally got to see matrix: revolutions. i don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful. it's funny, everyone i've talked to that loved the 2nd one hated the 3rd one and everyone that hated the 2nd one loved the 3rd one. i'm in the latter category. i've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now. i think it might have to do with our expectations. i loved the first one. i was waiting for the second one to come out ever since i heard they were making a trilogy. i had good expectations for reloaded, and i went to the theatre to see it on opening night and i was disappointed. the interesting thing is that about a month earlier, x-men 2 came out. i liked the first one a lot, but i wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 2nd one to come out (like how it was with reloaded). my expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent. i hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect. when i went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away. after about an hour and a half had gone by, i checked my friend's watch because i was worried the movie would end soon. enough matrix talk. i just got back from vegas, and i got to see david copperfield. hmmm. it might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an ""illusionist"" and all. i saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that i'm very proficient in visual media. i think it might be because i've seen all of those goddamned behind the scenes ""documentary"" stuff for the extended versions of fellowship of the ring and the two towers. in a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use. maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface. i had a point to this. copperfield. yeah, it was fun. i found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological ""illusions. "" what i mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show. again, it might've been better if i had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks. the older audience members must have been stumped. kenji's very cute. he's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, i don't know. next hour at the most. whenever i'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my cd book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot. instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me. big difference! before i'd moved the computer onto where it is now, i had it closer to the bed on ryan's desk. ken would spend most of his time while i was on the computer on the corner of my bed. er, sorry. amanda's bed. i still can't get over the time when i talked to her (a very rare time since the kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and i took her old apartment) and i was so excited that i'd bought this silky linen for, and i quote, ""my bed. "" ""you mean my bed,"" she said. ""i bought it. you're only keeping the things in that apartment while i'm gone working on the campaign. "" bullshit. when we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, ""oh, i have to go now. i need to go to my mom's bed. or what i should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though i sleep in it every night. "" yeesh! she's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent. i hope she'll get over it, because i really resent the fact that she believes i'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers. for some reason that really bugs me. ken's awake and about now. it's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while i'm typing. my times up anyway, so tah!

"the cell phone just rang. it was my roommate's phone so i didn't pick it up. i had a great weekend. all i can think about is my exboyfriend. how stupid am i to be writing about something like my exboyfriend. he makes me feel so weak. he is my achilles heal. he makes me feel like no other can. he manipulates me like no other. in a good way. he is all i can think about sometimes. i'm listening to dave matthews. i am wondering by the time i am done with this assignment whether or not i will selfdiagnose myself with add because i know i will jump from one thought to another. i will stop at 3:33pm. right now it is 3:17. i ate breadsticks today with my good friend ngozi. we have been friends for 7 years. tomorrow i get to see jets to brazil at emo's. i am extremely excited. sometimes i draw blanks on what to type. interesting. the blinking of the computer is bugging me. i am listening to dave matthews right now. he can be a little too jazzy for me. i am not a big fan of the saxophone. i don't like kenny g. even though he doesn't play the sax. i just called my best friend at osu. she hates it there. the thing is, writing for a good twenty minutes is hard. i got all my thoughts out just a minute ago because i wrote in my journal. i have my own website where i have journal entries and pictures and various other interesting things. after this i will do the pretesting. i hear it is pretty long. that's never fun. i hate the food at andrews. it tastes like a bunch of nothing. i also feel like keeling over after i eat the food, too. i am not using microsoft word for this. this is straight typing into the submit form. you think in a room of 540 kids there would be some boy to catch my eye. guess what? not one. i still love my exboyfriend. why do i jump back to him? i went to a frat party last friday. it was fun, but i don't think i could date a frat guy. they are not really my type. i wish i could get over my exboyfriend. but would that be a good thing or bad? who says i need to get over him? he was my first, possibly my last. i think he has very strong feelings about me too. i wonder though. boys can be very ambiguous at times. why can't we all be blunt? my kirby lane experience has been forever tainted. my food was cold and i saw a girl toss her cookies in the parking lot. people can be so irresponsible sometimes. they need to know their limit, or just take care of their business in the privacy of their own place not in front of kirby lane. my hands are crampy from all this typing. this is an interesting project. anyway, i am going home this weekend. back to grand prairie. i miss my niece. her name is ashley rene johnson. she is adorable. she just turned two and i wonder if she remembers me. i hope she is talking more. she is beginning to worry me. she barely talks. a homeless man hit on me today! in front of bevo's! i was startled, but was i guess flattered. he had sunglasses on, so maybe he saw a distorted version of me. he called me beautiful. hardly. it is getting cold. i am anxious to reread this writing assignment. it is 3:33. thank you.

"i am sitting in my room and i look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. trying to make my train of thought come to me so i can type it. all i can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues. he believes in ""boxism"", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. after this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. after we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. my boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as i remember when he first told me this. wow, that only took me ten minutes. i look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, i believe that those are some of the best times in my life. my class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. i have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. i hope it becomes the best time of my life. i have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. i love being able to do whatever i want when i want to. i hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.

" i was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because i've never really done anything like this. so i decided to put it off until the last minute. it is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. so far i havent really met any new people that i would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. i think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ut. it is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. although i know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. i don't know i guess will just have to see how things turn out. one thing that i am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. in fact she is a mere stones throw away in lld. she means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. i mentioned lld well that is a girls dorm, near llb which is my dorm whitis court that i now call home. whitis is a nice little community although i don't much enjoy some of the company here. the rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in jester. however its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. it seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. i guess its just one more thing ill have to get used to. not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. i am also planning on joining the marine corps and going to the plc course this summer. it is a big step in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. my father was a marine and his father was in the army and i feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. one thing that i would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. it seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. i know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. he came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. i really do love and care for my family but i believe they think much to the contrary. i guess i don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. this short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much i miss them.

" my nose is really stuffy right now and i had a fever earlier today but i think it's gone now. i hate not being able to breathe. i can hear the television right now. there's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. i can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. it's really cold in my room. i'm glad i decided to put my sweater on or i would be extremely cold. i can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. my stomach is growling. i have a craving for pizza. maybe i'll go get some as soon as i finish this assignment. my room mate seems to be frustrated right now. i just heard her sigh. she has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. she is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the ou game in dallas. i kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. the television just mentioned something about getting pizza. now my craving for it is increasing. i can taste it now. it's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. the phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. my room mate just left the room to go open the door. i can watch the television from where i am sitting in front of my computer. my room mate's brother just walked in. now all i can think about is what he is saying and i can't arrange my thoughts now. i just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. i can't think of what to type any more. i am quickly running out of ideas. time is passing really slowly. typing for 20 minutes is really hard. my room mate is still talking about the ou football tickets. she is getting rid of her wristband and now i am thinking how i need to take mine off too. what other homework do i have? i don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. it is the most boring class i have because all we do is work out problems. i should go to the discussion session today, but i would rather go shopping with my friend. i keep sniffing. i still wish i could breathe. i think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. i feel as though i want to chop off my nose just so i don't have to feel congested any longer. is this feeling normal? wanting to chop off my nose? everytime i get congested i feel the exact same way. now i am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. oh well, i bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. i wonder what caused me to become congested. i heard that a lot of people have been sick today. maybe something is going around. i always get sick. i have the worst immune system. my stomach keeps growling, but i am not sure if i want to eat because i feel as though i shouldn't eat because i want to lose weight although all my friends say that i am crazy for feeling this way. they keep telling me that i am perfectly fine the way i am. i still don't believe them because they don't see what i see in the mirror everyday. i've been told that i have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when i look in the mirror i see something different from what everyone else sees. but isn't that true for a lot of people? don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see? i think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. what isn't normal though is acting upon it. oh well. i can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because i begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. now i want goldfish because i just heard the commercial. i can't think of what to type again. i think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. my room mate just laughed. i wonder why she laughed. i can hear the people out in the hallway. these walls are really thin because i can always hear what is going on outside. the refrigerator noise is really annoying. it's so loud. i feel sick still. i just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. i never get enough sleep. i always end up staying up really late and then i feel dead in the morning. my foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. i have the worst circulation in the world. why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position i put them in. i think it has to do with the fact that i don't get the proper nutrients. my hands are starting to get tired now. i can't wait until i am finished typing. i have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. i wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. i bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than i can. oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. i could try but then it would just seem pointless. my contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. i hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. i am almost finished now and almost time to stop. the window just appeared saying that i am finished now and i can stop typing.

"i'm sitting here thinking that it's rather nice that the ethernet in my dorm is finally up, although i feel bad that my roommate is still having problems with her computer. she has an ibm aptiva and it seems that the wireless ethernet card just doesn't agree with her system. i staring at my philosophy book in front of me, and i think that drug legalization is an interesting subject. i've never considered drug legalization before. i always thought that drugs were bad and that was the final end to the case. however, all these philosophers (who aren't all that old and ancient) think that legalizing drugs might be a good idea. not that they want to promote drug use and make it easy to obtain for everyone, but legalized in a restricted fashion like cigarettes and alcohol. i also need to write some letters to my friends and stuff back home after this assignment since i haven't talked to them in such a long time. i can't decide which sort of stationary to use since i collect stationary and stickers, so there is a wide variety to choose from. i miss them greatly since i don't have as many friends in austin as i do back in houston. i haven't been here long enough. there are my roommates, though. as a matter of fact, i'm curious about whom my roommate is calling right now since he seems like a close friend. she's talking about food since she didn't get any before she came back, and that makes my stomach respond slightly. i only had 3 slices of pizza for dinner, and that apparently isn't enough since my stomach rumbled when my roommate mentioned food. she also asked me if a friend of ours was 21 or not, but i don't know. he's a nice guy since he helped me with my phone jack. i couldn't plug in my phone since the jack had been painted over to the point where the wires can't even register each other. i think i'm running out of things to say since i can't imagine what else might be of interest to occupy my mind. i've nothing to look forward to this evening except reading assignments from all of my classes. i realize that reading is essential to the learning process, but all these long chapters are tedious. there isn't too much of great interest in reading these heavy textbooks. i wish we had textbooks like they do in japan. their textbooks are really small and light so they don't get backaches and have to lug around huge backpacks. perhaps people in america will slowly grow shorter since the weight of backpacks stunts the growth of young people in this country while japanese children grow taller with the freedom of light backpacks. it would also be nice if international music from japan and other countries would be more accessible here. it's hard to find japanese popular music in texas. you have to either order them off the internet, or look for the small stores that specialize in importing these types of cds. it is rather expensive, too, but it is kind of ironic that japanese cds also cost about $30 in american dollars in japan. cds are cheapest in taiwan since they only cost about $5$10american dollars there. it would be nice if i could visit taiwan often, but i don't have the time and plane tickets cost more money than i have to spend on leisure travel in a year. i think that is a pity since i would like to see my uncle and my grandmother more often. and the fruits in taiwan are of a much greater variety and sweetness. the same type of fruit here is much smaller in size and a great deal more expensive. they don't taste the same either. i think my dad misses taiwan the most, although he has made many friends in houston. i miss having chinese food every night, too. it feels weird not using chopsticks for two weeks in a row. i have to remember to bring some the next time i went back to houston. i really miss my dad's cooking. he cooks really well. and he knows where all the good chinese restaurants are. it's hard for me to order food myself since i don't know the names of the dishes. the names i do know are in chinese, so sometimes i pronounce them wrong and the waitress gives me this funny look. i think the food i like best at this particular time is vietnamese noodles, dim sum, and this chicken steak with rice. i think i can get vietnamese noodles here, but dim sum is something best eaten in a big city because it's a specialty that only some cooks can get right. i am not sure about the last one since i am unfamiliar with the chinese restaurants around campus. it is something i may do during the weekend, exploring the nearby food places to see what is good to eat around here. i really talk about food a lot when i'm hungry, it seems. there isn't much in my room's refrigerator since i haven't gotten anything as of late, and it would be rude to eat everything that my roommates bought. i shall have to go to the store in the morning or after school to obtain some snacks for when i am hungry like i am now. the cafeteria here closes at 7 pm so i can't do anything about being hungry at the moment. i have a screen mate program that creates little lambs to wander around my computer screen. there are five of them wandering around right now, and one of them just sneezed. i think it is funny since i just sneezed recently. these lambs are very adorable, and they don't take up much computer space. they sleep and jump around, basically entertaining me while i'm doing my homework or just when i'm surfing around the internet. i love being connected to the internet at all times since all of my classes post important information on the web, and because i like to do personal research of my own into the subjects and hobbies i cultivate. it is also good for multiplayer games, but there seems to be a firewall in my dorm network that prevents me from hosting such

" well i finally found the website for this place, and now im not really sure what to say. im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. im also very angry at my roommate katie right now. sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. i signed up for an experiment thing in my csd class, and i have no idea where the room is! all it said was totten and the time and i have no idea what that means. i hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. oh i also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. i almost forgot! the ink on my hand is already wearing off, i should go write down the time on paper when im done with this. i really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. but its cool because i want to major in communications. the lady from there never called me back! i should call her again soon. well maybe i can get the application online or something. i wonder whats going on with the guys next door. they're always coming over here to say hi. i think im going to ask vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. poor kris. i can't believe hes sick now because of me! i hope hes feeling better. this chair is really nice! yesterday was pretty scary, i get really nervous about stuff like that. the bells at the tower were really pretty though when they were playing god bless america. i guess its a pretty historical moment, and im glad i was here for that. even though this wasnt my first choice i guess its ok. its kind of big, but maybe i need that. wow its been 8 minutes already. i don't know if this is due by 5 today. wait what is today. ok i ha 3 classes so its thursday and oh ok sept 13. thats tomorrow. this is crazy. i should get started on that map too. i wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. yeah i bet it does. why else would i be writing it. i think it said it was going to give me a printout of what i wrote and something else too. an analysis? i don't think a computer could do that. wow tomorrow is friday already yay i get to see all my friends back home! i have to go see peter and see how forbidden gardens is! he said hes still going to work there until the end of the year i think. i wonder what college he'll end up going to. he could get into princeton, i hope he does. if not hs coming to ut so that'll be cool. uh i can't believe this morning! im so mad at her! i wonder when shes getting back! should i act mad or just let it go? its probably better if i tell her. yeah i will. i think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. i guess im doing that. kind of just whatever pops into my head. oh feelings. wasnt i supposed to write about my surroundings too. i hate messing up and having to backspace! well i still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because i had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. i wonder what chapter im supposed to be on for this class. oh man chapter 2. ok well i have 1 done so that shouldnt be too hard. those notes took me forever! i need to think of a faster way. well i could highlight like in my geography book, but i think i might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. i hope nothing happens today! thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. its hard to type out all my feelings because i think faster than i type, so as soon as i think something, i start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. plus i think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe im not really recording exactly how i think. hmm. gosh im hungry. that breakfast was really good this morning! i thought it was going to be weird since i went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. thier theirselves. that doesnt look right. hey i have 45 seconds left. uh! as soon as i finished writing that the time was already off. this is annoying. ok well i guess im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what i actually wrote nonstop for 20minutes.

". it's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. currently i'm ecstatic because i just found out that my soccer team may be going to clemson college and that is where my best friend, kristen mckinney is going to school. i miss her so much! when i think of her i never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that god brought her into my life. with my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend i have ever had. i had so much trust in her, that many times i found myself dependent on her when i needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. i remember a time when i was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how i felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. immediately after i left i drove two blocks to kristen's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. people say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but i know that the friendship kristen and i have can't get much more intimate than ours. through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. that's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. although i miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because i am confident that god has prosperous plans for me at ut and kristen at clemson. also this will each me to become completely dependent on christ and his promises and not on fleeting things of this world. i really hope that i will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. already i find myself not making time to be in the word, which is the armor i need to remain strong against the enemy. i can relate with paul who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. but glory be to god who makes me free of guilt through jesus. why he chose me, i have no idea. my mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny chris farly lines or petty worries of the day. already i am thinking of other assignments i need to complete after this and of how i need to get in touch with certain people. yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to god, and i have such trouble letting christ shine out of me when i am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. lord, please make me a bondservant to serve you daily on this campus or where ever i am and who ever i run into.

"i have no clue how to start this. i haven't bought my psychology book yet. is that bad? i wish i could do that dj thing at the beginning of class. the guy last time played horrible music. i made a friend in that class named kelly. she seems cool. i hope we get to hang out. this feels like a diary entry. is that what it's supposed to be like? today natalie and i went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. one girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. it really got on my nerves. not because i'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. rob is really annoying me. i'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. but hang out with him at the same time. and eric. i don't know what to do with eric. i don't know if i love him or not. i don't know if i'll ever really be in love. he says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for me to say sweet things back to him. but i don't know if i really feel it or not. i think i'm really heartless. and i haven't been in english for a long time! i'm forgetting whether to capitalize the i"" in some words. odd. my arm hurts. am i going to have to keep this up for 20 minutes? i wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. mine is all boring teenage bullshit. let's try and write something deep. it's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. all the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. the faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. aaaand i'm spent. that was so lame. bullshit, as my english teacher would say. he is really cool. he made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. and he taught at pomona, which is my harvard. i would love to go to school in california. hopefully next year i can go to sfsu and be near eric and see if this thing will really work out. are boys the only thing on my mind? am i really that shallow? at this moment, i'm afraid so. i blanked. i have to start a new stream. i'm losing a lot of weight, i think. my wrists are smaller than they used to be. i don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. i want to be super skinny. and if not eating is how i have to get there, i just might do it. i don't think i'm fat right now. there are just parts of me that could be smaller. and i'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. i'll be the anorexic that always eats milky way. because those are so good and i could never give them up. when do i become an adult? i have no clue where that came from. but really. when? it's really quiet in here. i can hear natalie typing on occasion. she is a good student. always on top of things. our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. the other day it smelled like clam chowder. not pleasant. i miss my family. i never thought i would. i don't miss them so much that i'd cry or be terribly homesick. i mainly miss the meals. and the fact that if i was sick they would go and buy me what i needed. i took birth control for the first time on friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. it made me appreciate my mom so much more, which i rarely do. yes, i am a spoiled brat. i didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but i am one nonetheless. and i have no concept of money because i am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in october to go see eric again. and my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. i'm not going to tell her this time. i'll give natalie all the information. and pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. i like our dorm room. it has a lot of character. i love our posters. natalie and i have the same tastes in a lot of things. of course, i'd much rather have my best friend monica as a roommate. i miss her so much. and with her, i do miss her to tears. she is the only one i could be myself around. i love her so much. and feel horrible about what i did to her last year. i blew her off. i wasn't a good friend. and i'll never forgive myself for it. the girls across the hall from us just got home. i don't like them that much. jenny is nice. she listens to morrissey. and, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. most morrissey girls are lesbians. and paige, the other girl, is really stuck-up. and she listens to lots of local bands from dallas that i despise. so yes. it takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. i'm very selective with friends. which i shouldn't be because i'm not the coolest person to hang out with. and boy do i have low self-esteem. i constantly put myself down. eric gets annoyed with it. and i type really hard, too. i think natalie is annoyed with this sound right now. oh well. seriously, is someone going to read this? is there a right or wrong way to do it? i hope not. i'm sure i'm doing it the wrong way. rob just told me that he is joining the army. i don't want him to. and i told him why. and he told me not to be punk rock because i'm an indie princess. that's so lame. just because i listen to that kind of music doesn't mean i can't have political views. and this was a good exercise. very therapeutic. thank you, professor!

"stream of consciousness that term reminds me so much of virginia woolf and my long semester studying her and mrs. dalloway. i can't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how mrs. dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad. i feel so bad for her. i wonder how fast twenty minutes really is i bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but i guess it is kind of interesting i just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing. i am so glad that it is labor day weekend and i am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and i guess some studying too although that won't be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal. it is so interesting how i am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and i some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that i can concentrate on just about anything. i hope this year goes well because i think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year i if the semester goes well. i'm getting kind of sad now that because i am leaving town tomorrow i am going to miss the first football which will be my first texas football game and i have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun, but at least there are plenty of other games that i can attend. my hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering i haven't even typed for 10 minutes. i wonder if i am missing out on anything while i am sitting her typing this but i guess it isn't that big of a deal i don't think there are many people her anyway and i don't know where anyone is. i was thinking about how when i graduated from high school that i would be balling my eyes out but i didn't cry then i thought i would cry when my parents left me here all alone. but the weird thing is i haven't cried or anything yet i haven't even gotten homesick. i mean let's face it isn't like i would have anything spectacular to do even if i was home so i guess that helps in the homesickness department. it is so cold in my room i am absolutely freezing and there is no way in which to control the air, i need gloves and winter boots. i really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings i mean i know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat, but then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like i am surprised i haven't gotten frost bite from these frigid places. well the time has actually gone faster than i expected it to it hasn't been all that bad once i got over the whole virginia woolf suicide and her book that i had to suffer through and analyze. it has actually been kind of fun i mean all i have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how i am feeling and that isn't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you write because personally i don't' want everyone in the world to know how i feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part. i am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best. that is real comfort food. wow i am beginning to feel hungry now but i don't know for what also i really need these twenty minutes to over so that i can run and go get a drink i am really thirsty. oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer. but hey i don't have to type for too much longer.

"well, i don't know where to begin. i guess it started when she came over for lunch. i never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. she swooped in and plopped herself on my new pappason chair. she was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. as she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the hit or miss store i noticed it. how her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. i mean, don't get me wrong randy is the best friend i have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. as she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. it was barely noticeable that my over grown lab dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. then the words just fell out of her mouth. ""he's come to rescue me, and i'm going to go. "" i have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. i was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. my best friend was on her way to her life long dream. all i could do was cry and hug her. then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. there was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and celebrate! wow. she's gone. what is left of me? i sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. i mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. i don't know how long. it seems like a whole season passed. then one day, i got tired of crying. i knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and i'd be darned if i was going to let it rot inside of me. so, i did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. i joined a club. i went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. but you know what, i didn't find it. so, i began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. i left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. but, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what i'm going to do? i'm going to meet myself a man. i will find out what love is all about, and i mean real love. so, take that! thus, my man hunt began. i browsed the video dating services, the internet (big mistake, huge), i scoped men at the grocery store, i bought some roller blades and tried out hike and bike trails, but nope, nothing'. oh, i met men all right, but the kind of guys i met made me want to swear off of them forever. yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. he's out there, my prince is going to come rescue me, i just have to have faith in real love. after some serious time had passed, i stepped out of my life and looked at what i had, and noticed that my many hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. so i just plum gave up. i was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. and that was it. so, i dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then i began to pray. it helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when i shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? my heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. how in the world can the words i choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the lord? he is the absolute perfect gentleman. i began to talk with him every day. i began to listen for his voice and i began to find him everywhere i went. i realized, i was never alone. i was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. the lord god in heaven loves me, and i love him. and you know what else, after i gave my heart to jesus, i met mark. would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 great danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as dixie bolted out my front door. we met, just that simply. he has arrived at my front door now, so i better go. we are on our way to jamaica oh how i love to be rescued!

"ok, so i am supposed to write about what i am feeling, hearing and thinking. all that, so, the trucks outside my window are driving around backwards for some strange reason and the beeping is really a pain. it starts at 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning and the beeping goes on all day long. my roommate wants to know how much work those trucks can actually accomplish when they are driving backwards! lol, i agree and would really like to know, all i see when i look out my window is a big whole in the ground, not to much progress. but i am sure the construction will be moving along slowly but surely. oy veh, i have not typed in such a long time, i have gotten so slow. i am just like my grandma, new technology drives me nuts. my computer, phone, everything, too confusing! i like having no alarm clock or phones or computers or anything, but its all just part of america i guess, so along the lines of beeping, the door to my floor is beeping again, the alarm has gone off every time someone goes in or out of the door. it's all part of dorm life i guess, luckily i can sleep through anything so it doesn't really bother me much, just when i am trying to study but that is why we have libraries. i am a little worried though that i won't wake up is there is a fire drill or something. my roommate (i wonder how you spell that - room mate? roommate? or roommate?) anyhow, she will wake me up. thank goodness. my suitemates just made dinner even though its late and it smells yummy! i think it's pork though so i'll have to miss out on this one. it's amazing the things you can cook in the microwave these days. ezmac seems a little scary but most food turns out pretty good. i really miss my moms cooking, i think that is got to be one of the hardest parts of being away from home, the food and the fact that me family would always eat together. it's so quiet here i can tell the weekend is winding down. friday and saturday nights are so noisy and something is always happening. now its all hush hush. i've only been typing for nine minutes and i can't believe how much random stuff i have thought of. i took a yoga class today with a friend, i had never taken one before and somehow you move around for like an hour and come out of the class feeling like you just took a great nap for the whole time. the instructor played this awesome music (the only word i can think of to try to describe it is zen""), it was happy and sad at the same time. very interesting. i have taken up going to the gym because it is about the only past time that lets me avoid my school work and procrastinate without feeling too guilty. it's a great excuse, so to the gym i go. it's fun though, i made friends with all the crickets that live in and around the pool. i have never seen such big crickets before in my life, only in pinnochio and stuff like that, they are huge here, it's like they are on steroids or something. bugs are not my favorite but i guess they can enjoy swimming too. i want some popcorn, ya know, like the really good but really bad for you movie theater popcorn. how come everytime someone pops a bag, it seems like everyone in the world can smell it! yum! so, my walls are covered in post-its, i always need a reminder for something and my room is finally starting to look a bit ""lived-in"", the walls are so bare and the rooms are so boring. i like things bright and busy busy busy! my roommates favorite color is pink and her whole side of the room is light pink, which just happens to be my least favorite color, i think that may have something to do with me never wanting to hang out in my room, it's really awful. she is awesome and we get along perfectly except for out choice of color so i really am lucky. but anyhow, it's amazing how a color can affect your mood so much (or at least mine). i really wish i could type faster. mas rapido! i haven't used my computer hardly at all, i got used to living without technology this summer and i loved it. people here rush all the time, we need to learn how to take it easy and just enjoy everything that is around us. we are so silly even though we pride ourselves with being so advanced, i think we just get caught up in it all and forget how to take a break and chill. i am tired of thinking, i have been doing it all day, i wish i had a switch to just turn my brain off for a few minutes. my roommate just walked in, she opened the door and i jumped, now she is looking for her key, what a bummer to lose. that or an i'd, your i'd is like your life here, ok, well, my time is running out, hope you enjoyed reading what all was floating around in my head! wow, done at exactly the right time. woo hoo!

"i am watching mtv cribs with chris pontius. today was hot and i'm supposed to go running with nathan but it's still too hot so i want to go later. maybe i'll get some of my work done before then so i won't stay up so late like i have been lately. i'm really tired so i took a nap today and slept like a rock. i don't know when i'm going to supper though because i don't want to eat before i work out or i'll feel sick so i might just get nathan to cook for me tonight. i am starting to miss everyone from back home because i'm not usually away from my family, friends, and sam for this long. i guess i will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. i want to go home to see everyone but i really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. i'm running out of things to think about because the tv is on and it's distracting me. the song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. i like all my classes so far but i'm still kind of scared. especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. i'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but i can't get tired and go to sleep now because then i won't get anything done and i won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night i couldn't fall asleep forever and then when i finally fell asleep i kept waking up so i felt like i didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. i'm kind of hungry but lately i haven't felt that good so i don't feel like eating. maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so i'll have someone to sit with. i hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then i sit with people i don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but i want to meet them and not be rude. i'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well i have way too much school work and other stuff to do and i know if i would have rushed i wouldn't have time for anything else and i really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. my back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but i can't get into a back specialist for a while so i kind of just have to live with it. and i love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. i decided that i'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because i really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in lubbock at texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so i went and got him a present saturday with my mom at the mall in san antonio. she wanted me to go back to hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but i wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but i really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake austin and it was really good like seafood'mexican food. i've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while.

"i don't know what to expect. by best friend's father passed away monday and i am really worried about the family. his mother does not work and he is in college without much financial aid. i hope he will be able to continue school, but i don't know what's going to happen. i am scared to face them, though. i can't see the family being whole without the father. they were always so close to one another and could share anything with each other. i envied that relationship because my family was broken up at an early age. when my father and mother divorced, i was only about two or three. i actually don't even know when they divorced. i really can't even picture my parents being together at all. they are so different now. i guess that is why i was envious of my friend's family. i never have had a very close relationship with any members of my family. i feel alone inside my parents house. when i went to my friend's house, though, they were always so open with each other and there was never any tension or anxiety between them. i don't see how a family like that could be torn apart, or actually why. some people think there's a reason for everything, and some people believe that it's all a part of god's plan, but i, personally, have no idea what reason or higher purpose there could be for this man's death. maybe there isn't any reason. maybe humans have a natural tendency to search for reasons, causes, purpose. are we all just misleading ourselves? could it be that humans are merely just another species on the face of this planet? who knows. james' father knows. he has all the answers to all the questions in life. it's funny that the questions of life are only found in death. he is dead, nevertheless, and i still can't come to that realization. traumatic experiences just never happen to me or people i know. until now, i guess. what the hell happened? five minutes to go. i remember just before i left, coming back to austin for my second year, shaking his hand, and hearing him wish me luck. how can that man be dead? then i remember that death is a part of living; death is the price tag of life. we all have to face it sometime, and i guess it's not going to happen at our convenience. we have to prepare ourselves for anything, but how? i don't know of any way i could have prepared for this. if i would have known that he was going to die, i would have tried to stop it from happening. i would have wanted him to keep on living. why is that? if death is so common, why do humans try so hard to prevent it, rather prolong it from happening? i can't say that it's selfishness, i wouldn't want him to live just so i could live happy. but that is a part of it. but, the answer awaits me as well. i guess i'll have to prepare myself for my death. that means i better start living my life.

" currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. today is my 9 month anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. she is the best thing that ever happened to my life. i want to by her a ring and i have been giving it plenty of thought. i have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. i thought about my grandmother, who is affected my alzheimer's. i felt gult come over me when i thought of all the times i yelled at her. i live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. i generally understand that i am not truely mad at my grandmother when i yell at her. i am mad at the disease. i don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. i got addmitted to the business school thats the reason i am here. and i have been thinking that i have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that i am living. i worked harder than most and i played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my senior class. but again i feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. what should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words i could say, i'm in the business school. people look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which i can officailly say bothers me. i love my mom. . she called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. she is so worried about me. oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind i have. my roomie says that i complain alot. . do i. my girlfriend has said the same but i disagree with them both. i just want to be the best at everything and i have to win or im not happy. just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. god made me competitive and thats the way i live. back to that business thing. . i worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. see my parents had a divorce my junior year of high school. thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. my dad left us and i can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. besides that i'm in love and i have the best girl i could ever dream of. her mom says we can't be together but all through our senior year we stayed together. sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. not loyalty and all the universal answers to what makes a best friend. she sacraficed her family to be with me. her mom said, either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him. she chose me in an instant. . for a long time i woundered why. . and to this day the only answer i could find is love. true love is what we share and today is 9 months. love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. my grandfather had to raise me since i never had a father. that hurts me more than the world could ever know. oh another thought came to me. i am suffering from sexual frustration. i'm not sure if i can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right? well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1'2. seems like forever but we will be fine. we pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. i nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. if i complain too much sorry. thats just me right?

"i hate driving in austin. there is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. people are so impolite when it comes to cars. jay just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. and now i have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. my mom didn't want me to take it with me. i hope the body shop does a good job. that is my main concern. i had a headache this morning. i think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. my roommate was being nice to me this morning. jerry told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. and boys are so much trouble. why does sak always have to do this to me? i think i will finally answer his question truthfully now. i thought i had been, but he was right, i'm still hiding something. i don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what i want. and then he says not to want anything. why must he always try to be the good guy? i don't know if he is telling me the truth. if he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? this boy is driving me nuts. i don't understand why he keeps doing this. deep down, i think i know the answer. but i guess i hide from things a lot. people always say i hide myself. sak says i hide myself in questions. i do. i never answer personal questions. i answer them with questions. i don't know why. maybe i do need a psychiatrist. i think too much. i think i scare sak. because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. i don't like her. she doesn't like me either. i've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. she looks at me funny. i think she's stringing him along. that's why he does this to me. but then he told me i was wrong. he said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. i think it scares him to let himself go. for some reason i think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. he saw through me hiding behind questions. but i think it's because i don't doubt him. i trust his opinions and his thoughts. that's something i don't do with most people. i trust him. which surprised me. it usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. maybe because i am always hiding. for some reason i think he has the key to unlock whatever it is i am hiding. and i think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that i can't open myself. that's what i want, i guess. i want to tell him the truth but i can't. because like him. i am hiding. we're both hiding. only he does a better job at it. probably because he is a guy. why do i trust him? i don't understand that. but sometimes i think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. why do i trust him so much? i think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. i remember when i first met him; i was not attracted to him. he looked cunning to me. like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. but then i think he also has the heart not to. that's why i think i started to like him. he has a good heart. and i think that's one quality that is hard to find. oh my gosh! i guess this answers his question of what i think about him. i think i will give him a copy of this one day? i will tell him the truth. the entire truth of what i thought when i first met him until now. but i also want him to tell me too. because i don't want to be the only one who opens up. but i don't think that will ever happen. i think my twenty minutes is about to be up. and i have such a bad memory; i don't remember anyone's name. i feel so bad. why can't i remember? that's unfair to me because people know who i am but i have no idea who they are. i need to work on my memory.

"i can't believe i'm doing this assignment should be asleep right now i wish that my roommate would quit playing his music. my other roommate is a dork he's always talking about god and crap and telling me that i shouldn't drink and this and that fuck him he's no better than me he's just as bad in other ways i really hate it when all his friends come over here it's like fucking chinatown that's what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the 22nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and that's where all the hot girls are i need to get on that floor i should have just lived in towers that would have been better. speaking of hot girls i wonder what stephanie is doing right now. i really should call her and try and hook up with her i can't tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but it's hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did i just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that i am just a perverted moron but that's not true i don't know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think i am stupid, especially when i am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and i can't believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable. i wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game i really hate my pledge brother nayel that guy seems so shady if he's not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch he's acting like a fucking tool that should be nayel's new nickname, tool. oh well its been 20 minutes and i am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye.

"my love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as i sit here and write this assignment. i don't understand any software but everything for ibm, and the macintosh is completely foreign to me. i must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey i am new to this whole apple thing. apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. every time i type the word a lot, i am reminded of my english teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. i'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that i should have written it as two. i think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. i see a lot of people around campus just like that although i remember their faces and words, for the life of me i cannot remember their names, and i would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, azi, do you remember me?? more than likely i would not, or i would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. i do that a lot. people will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before i responded by just looking up. my thoughts consume me sometimes. i have a problem with daydreaming. i know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. it is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. i was talking about my thoughts, and how i daydream. well, lately all i can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man i am to marry. it seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. i have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. i went to a summer church retreat, and i think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because i met guys for the first time that i could honestly see myself marrying. this has never happened before, and as i glance around the campus, i just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and i am here longing for there company. it is not like i need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. i miss them a whole lot because i have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that i met at this church retreat in california. i think i forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout cali, and i have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless i actively seek a job to where i can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful golden state of california. all of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and i miss them terribly. i have to go back some day, i haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as i had in california. i know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little bit of why i would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason i would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a baptist church, or a jewish synagogue embodies. that spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. it would be ideal if i could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and i stress this because that is a big part of my life, but i am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. it's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, i am not asking for the ken and barbie playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, i just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. i just don't think that i can have that right now, and that is why i spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. the challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. and if i may i would like to end with a statement that linda ellerbee made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes.

"my roommate finally just left for work! i don't mean to say finally with such a relief, but my head is just pounding from her music! i really like her a lot, we get along great, we just don't have the same taste in almost anything. now, i'm not a neat freak, but living in such a small place for the next nine months, i would kind of like to keep the room picked up. i don't think she feels the same way! this morning, she ate cheerios, but threw most of them away, so our room smelled like rotten cheerios all morning. she finally threw them away, it's not so bad. i think some of her habits and ways come hand in hand with the fact that she is an art major. i don't mean to be stereotypical, it just seems that the artist in her contributes to her taste in many things. twenty minutes sure is a long time to write! that could also be because i'm not much of a writer. i used to like to write for fun, when i was younger, but being forced to do things makes me tend to not enjoy them as much. now, this is not so bad because i'm not worried about correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. , so i sure hope those things don't matter! i can't believe i waited until three hours before the due date to do this paper. actually, i can, i am such a procrastinator. i think it is the worst feature about myself. especially now in college, when there really is no time for procrastination. there always seems to be some sort of studying or reading i could be doing, but then again, there are a million other things that are just so much more appealing and at the time seem to be just as important as that homework! like for instance, it would almost be a sin to not see the final episode of my favorite tv show, or to miss out on what the rest of my friends are doing! only three other girls i went to high school with came to ut this year, and two of them live right across the hall! it's so strange how things work out. speaking of strange things, i saw a girl that i was best friends with when we were very young, like kindergarten through second grade! i couldn't believe we even recognized each other! it was so crazy! it was great to see her. then last night, i saw a boy that i went to junior high with, he actually lives on the same floor as me! i moved around a lot when i was younger, so the people i see, most likely don't even know each other! wow, i just looked up at the timer and it's already been more than fifteen minutes! that sure went by a lot faster than the first five! i wanted to go home this weekend, but i'm waiting until next, our town is having the county fair then. i don't want to admit that i miss home because i told everyone that i couldn't wait to leave! i was tired of the small town gossip and the close minded ideas of all those small town people! i do love it here in austin and i even have some family here, but i miss my parents! i think i might even miss my two younger brothers, now that's crazy! i think i just miss everything! i miss my kitty and i especially miss my best friend! he went to texas tech and i keep telling myself that i'll never see him again, but i pray that i will!

"coming to ut has to be one of the best choices i have made. living in dobie has to be one of the worst. i wish i would have stayed at one of the honors dorms because the people seem so much more sociable. it seems that this place is extremely cliquish and such. my roommate is cool, although he seems to already have a group of friends here and isn't at all interested in making new ones. i'm a very social person. i have to be in contact with people all of the time or i get severely lonely. i don't like to feel cut off. i wouldn't even stay at my dorm the first night because i didn't have the internet or my cable connected. it is odd how we feel like television, internet, and phones make us feel so connected. i would die now without the internet. i love being able to chat with all of my friends about how they are doing in college. it is so odd being here at ut with so many students from big schools. i'm from such a small school i feel like i don't fit in or i don't know enough. it is odd how being from a small school can make you feel so inadequate at times. i feel like the others have some greater advantage than me. being at such a big university is such a big advantage. that is why i chose to come here. i really love how much a university this size has to offer. i mean look how awesome the stadium is and the the academic programs. the theater is wonderful and who can top gregory gym? it is so awesome to be surrounded by so much, but it is also so odd to feel so lonely sometimes. there is so much to do, but not always someone to do it with. i have one friend here with me from school. she is so much more than a friend. she means everything to me but she has hurt me so badly. i don't know if it is possible to overlook what she did to me last october. i can't tell if i could possible love her more than anyone else i'll even incounter, but it really seems possible. how else could you forgive someone so easily for hurting you so bad. she wants to be everything to me and all she wants is for me to say the same. but it is hard to base my life around someone that has thrown my life off balance once. she is such a good person and all she needs is someone to really love her and i really do love her a lot. i hope i can put the past behind us. we are so perfect ogether. we love similar things, yet we are really different. she loves art, i love art. she loves music, i love music. we are passionate about many of the same things. the sexual relationship is so nice too. i like feeling so hot and passionate. sex is kinda a thing in a relationship that is sybolic of acceptence to me. i mean when i bare myself to someone else it makes me feel good. i feel like we are really together. i've never even been with another girl. i feel like i am so unexperienced but it doesn't matter i guess. if you find someone you are willing to stay with why does it matter how many people you have sex with. i guess it is just society that tells us that we should have many sexual partners before marriage. that is so different from what the church teaches. i really don't agree with much of what the church say about sexual represion and not going with basic instincts or enjoying ones self. i kinda am a member of my own sect of religion. i think that there has to be some supreme authority but how am i supposed to believe that man can concieve this preterhuman figure. it doesn't seem like man should be able to explain the creator and so why try. i think that mans purpose it to better himself and the generation following him.

"right now i'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. i made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. i don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. i have tears in my eyes as i'm typing, which is strange because i have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. my mom has always told me that i was overly sensitive, i thought i could overcome it, i think i can overcome anything. i had mono a few years ago, and i overcame that one. my mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that i've talked to are just not to stimulating, i guess i should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. i always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. i am this close to packing my bags and going home. last week, i was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. my roommate and i are just not compatible, i mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but i find her incredibly dull and childlike. she is a sophomore and i am a freshman. she has a really low self esteem and that's something that i don't deal well with, because i used to too. i don't like to think about those times, because i've overcome them. i fear that she is what i will become and it makes me resent her a bit. i don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. i make my life incredibly competitive, and i like to win. my cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. but we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. she and i are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. i know that i've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. she's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and i've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, i walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but i really enjoyed myself tonight, i haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. i don't know if ut is the right place for me, and i don't know. this is ridiculous. i'm here, and i'll graduate from here. is this the sort of paper you're looking for? my mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. this his how my mind works, worry after worry. i'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. on a happy note, i saw a guy in my philosophy class today with absolutely amazing hair. it was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! i admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, i'll just stay the way i am. i miss my dog. i talked on the phone to my parents last night and i heard her bark in the background. i am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. it has been the first time that i've gotten homesick. i think it's because i am going home tomorrow. before, i didn't get homesick because i didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but i saw a dallas morning news today and got all choked up. what is all of this about anyway? where do i benefit in the long run of living with someone i don't like and being forced to eat bad food? i'd much rather be in my own apartment. ha! my folks would really go for that one. they are so overprotective. the people that i was originally going home with are going to the dave matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, i'm also not allowed to go to the tx v. ou game. that is stinky! i just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. i swear! if my roommate asks one more time if i want to talk about anything that's bothering me i will scream. i told her already that i'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. okay, deep breath. back to grandma. she is the cutest old lady in the entire world. she is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. it's fabulous. i told her i was coming home and she got so excited! my twenty minutes are up, but i feel much better now, i'm glad i got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! i don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though i am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this.

"you know, being in a relationship is great. and i absolutely love college. but i have discovered that it is really hard to put the two of them together. i mean, jason and i have been together for about 8 ' monthssmall on the grand scale of things, i know, but it seems like an eternity. in fact, i find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before jason. he is, after all, my first real serious relationship. and i don't know. i mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn hard to keep what we have in college. i love him. i mean really love him. he says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. i think that if you're in love, then you know. so that means that he probably doesn't love me. we're lopsided. so that kind of sucks, but i deal with it, you know? i mean, sometimes it gets me down because when i say, ""i love you"" i don't hear one back. so, i get depressed. but he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and i guess that's enough to suffice. maybe sometimes i feel like i just have enough love for the two of us, but other times i become really doubting. maybe i don't love him either. i mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? how do we know that love even really exists? how do we know? i mean, yeah, there are songs, books, and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity. but how do i know that it's not just a really big ""like. ""? i mean, maybe that's all i have for jasona really big like. that makes me think. because, if it is just a really big like, then where did all of this ""love"" stuff come from? do i say that i love him because it's my first real relationship and i just don't really know any better? am i really just enamored with him because he was my first? is the fact that i'm questioning it at all mean that it isn't real love? don't they say that if you have to question love, then it isn't really love? i mean, i know that i would do anything for this boy. and i mean anything. i know that i wake up in the morning and i can't wait to be with him, to see him, to touch him, to smell him, to make him smile, to make him laugh, to hear his voice. i know that when i'm not with him, i am wondering where he is or what he's doing or wondering if he's wondering about me. but, it's like deep down, i know that he's not. he doesn't feel about me the way that i feel about him. and because he says that he likes me a lot, and he's not sure if it's love or not. since i like him more, that makes me think that what i feel must be love because it's on a higher level than that of which he feels. logical, right? i didn't think so either. i guess i'm just confused. most guys aren't as confusing as jason. actually, for the most part, he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy. but he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him. i mean, i'm always wondering ""ok, he says he's fine. but does that mean that he's really ok, or does that mean that he's still upset but doesn't want to tell me?"" i mean i secondguess myself all of the time with him. i have a really low selfesteem when i'm around guys. i'm tall, so i always think that guys don't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter, cuter girl. i mean, jason is in a frat and he doesn't want me to go to parties with him. that really hurts my feelings. i feel like it's because of a lot of reasons, but the main one being that i'm not pretty enough for him to ""show me"" to his brothers or whatever. also, because he wants to not be attached to anyone at a party so that he can hook up with other girls for one night standssomething that he tells me he's done before. that really bothers me. he tells me that he's cheated on all of his girlfriends beforeso how do i know that he's not going to cheat on me, too? what assurances do i have???? how can i trust him? especially when i know that he's done it before? how do i know he won't do it again? monica tells me ""once a cheater, always a cheater. "" is she right? should i not trust him? do i have a choice?

"i just came back home to austin from houston this morning. it was not a bad drive today. i am now at home relaxing for the remainder of the day. i really kind of miss home but i guess i will get used to living on my own after a little while. i miss my parents and girlfriend. it is hard to leave the people you care about the most knowing you won't see them for a period of time. hopefully though i will start to meet many new people here at the university of texas. i really like austin, now i just need to explore it. i know a few people up here and they have helped make it a lot easier to be here. i hope school is not too terribly hard. i know i must study and do all of my assignments and make sure i do not fall behind. i think reading and attending class are two of the most important elements of college. i am somewhat scared though at the fact that three tests comprise your semester grade. if you do bad on an exam, you will really have to work hard to pull yourself back up. i just don't know? i need to get into the routine of college before i can give a valid evaluation of what college really is to me. i hope i do well. enough with school. i am so excited to be living on my own. i have new responsibilities as well as many new freedoms. there is nobody here to tell me when to come home or what to do. i am the superior. with this new freedom though i know i must watch and take care of myself. no one is here to pick up after me and no one is here to watch over me which is kind of frightening. it creates a sense of happiness, but at the same time a sense of fear also.

"well today i went with my friend kai to his texas crew orientation. he tried to get me to join, but i just don't think that crew would be the sport for me. i prefer to play volleyball above all other sports. just this past week, i signed up for the volleyball teams here at ut. i would really enjoy to play for the school, or at least on a team, competing with others. i used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in houston, i guess that's why i like it so much. i miss being around my family, but i know that they are proud of me for being here at ut. i wanted to go back this weekend, since it's a 3 day weekend, unfortunately, i am a little behind in my classes, so i wanted to take advantage of this time to catch up and maybe get ahead a little. the reason which i am behind in my classes, which is so unlike me, is probably because i am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time. i believe that this is happening because of the long summer. well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me, which for some reason i have been avoiding. i guess because i don't want anything to do with him, i don't even consider him a good friend. just now, my friend whom which i met through hang out, a gay organization here on campus, instant-messaged me asking me to go out. he has been taking me out, to places i wouldn't even think of going, since i arrived here at ut. now him i do consider him a good friend. he is a really good guy, really fun to be around with. i don't know if i am starting to develop feelings for him, which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school. i spent last night at his house, just hanging out, talking about whatever came to our minds, and fell asleep on his bed. nothing happened, but for some reason, i sort of wanted something to. i believe that i wanted something to happen because i have been feeling very lonely these past few days, maybe because of i need a boyfriend, or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give, or not going home for the weekend. or maybe i just genuinely like him. well i guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in houston 2 days ago, and my mom is going to mail it to me, and if all goes as planned, i will be able to keep the money for myself, if financial aid allows me to. so i will use that money to pay off my bank bill. and today, my mom called, and i felt like i was there even though we are 3 hours away, which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend. right now, i don't want a boyfriend for various reasons. one, i have decided to put off sex until i get tested for hiv. i don't have suspicions that i may have it, but i have had unprotected sex, and so i just want to be sure. second, i need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me. third, i just don't know if i can handle going through what i went through with my ex all over again. not that it would necessarily happen again, but i just don't want to take the risk. or maybe i should just be brave and take a risk. i need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision.

"i have no idea what to type. am i supposed be be capitalizing and what not? oh well. hmm its mike's birthday today. he is 22, that must be nice. wow, this is a great song straylight run - the tension and the terror. it's freezing in here. i need to finish reading government and psychology, and hopefully on the road too. it's a lot easier reading that though. yoga's at 8:30. am i supposed to meet melissa there or is she coming back to the room? o well. i miss mikey =( man, as i'm whining as if this is a diary entry. man, i forgot to call alex again. i guess i'll do it later. hmm, i wonder how tough rowing tryouts really are. o well. man, all i'm saying is o well. still not really sure what i'm supposed to be writing. now i'm listening to the juliana theory. good stuff. i'm not all about the class dj's choice of rap stuff. i don't think he is right about it making people more energetic. hearing a song for the millionth time that wasn't good the first time does not exactly put me in a great mood for an hour and a half psych lecture. but i do think i'm going to like the class (as i'm kissing up to the computer). no, its interesting stuff though. hmm, i'm still not sure about how government is going to be. i want to do law, and i think it's really interesting, but there's no way i'll have time for all the reading. and a lot of it is way too boring. hopefully if i take notes in class and what not i'll be ok. i hope calc won't be too hard this semester. a lot of it should still be review from high school, but i bet the end will be new hard stuff. too bad mikes not still around. the engineering majors are too damn smart. am i supposed to censor stream of conscious writing? because i figure that goes against the point, so i shouldn't go back and fix stuff, but this sure as heck isn't formal. o well. of course i am tempted to go back and count how many times i've said o well. ridiculous. hmm, i should really clean this room. but i guess most of the mess on my side is amber's junk. o, i guess no psych tomorrow. more time to nap in the afternoon, which is good because i know i'll be up way too late if i'm going to get close to finishing the reading for government. how late is gregory open? i think 1 but is that every day? i guess megan will know. we can always run outside too. the heat sucks, but i guess we should get used to it if we're going to have to do tryouts in the afternoon. texas is too damn hot. i miss wisconsin. we got to road trip over xmas. i don't know what to tell the parents though. hmm i'll have to plan. that way we can go by michigan like we told mike we would. hmm i miss summer. i know fall won't compare. i'm so sick of stupid frat parties, etc. at least i have awesome roomies. well, looks like times almost up and i've spent 20 minutes whining and doing this assignment completely wrong. once more, oh well.

"i have been extremely pissed off for the entire day. i have just started classes again at ut. i am trying to get into the pharmacy school. i work at a pharmacy now, but the people there are driving me insane. i have panic disorder, but lately instead of panicking i am just angry. i almost ran into about 5 cars driving on mo-pac. road rage?! my therapist is trying to assure me that i am not the one who is crazy - it's just the people around me. my job, my parents, my friends"". i am taking things out on john who does not deserve it - he is just here all the time. i wrote him a nasty email and i think he just replied. he is so sweet, i really should make a huge effort not to do that to him. he is probably used to it after 3 years. yuck. i would have been tired of my temper tantrums a long time ago. i tried acupuncture today for anxiety and my irritable bowel syndrome. the guy treating me at the student clinic was a moron. i usually get good people. he is graduating soon from that academy and i am scared of what he will do to his patients. i am going to take a xanax now and see how long it takes me to calm down. cool, i can time it. ready, go. ok. i have to work all weekend when i need to be studying. my wrist hurts. maybe from typing, maybe from that moron. this should be pretty interesting for someone to read. i have lots of other homework that i could be doing, but this is all i have the brain power for right now. no offense, but it's not biochemistry. i am glad to be back in school. i hit the wrong key and it stopped for like 3 seconds. weird. i have to work with john the head pharmacist this weekend. they are all trying to manipulate me into working more hours than i want to. they have now told me that if i don't work all of these hours that they will find someone else to work there. it's all or nothing. i know they are bluffing, because it would take them so long to train someone that one of the other techs that works at the store would have to cover the weekends for months. no one wants to work weekends. so i should do it because i'm in school and that's easier for me because i am a student. that's their logic. that's crap. i think i'm almost done bitching. i am going to work tomorrow and if he doesn't make some compromise with me then i may just walk out and let him work by himself. that won't happen. he will say anything to keep me there. and i'll probably fall for it and think everything is ok and then he will just change his mind at the end of the weekend. so, i should just change jobs, or just change stores. eckerd's sucks - they all have their heads up their butts. aaaah! i guess i feel a little better now, but not much. i will just have to think about something else if i am going to feel better. my glasses are foggy. they always get scratched because i don't take care of them. i need an eye exam. haven't had one since grade school. who says grade school? i'm old. i have to be good this weekend. even though i am going to a birthday party that will probably be not quite as good as i need to be. whatever, that didn't make sense. i wonder when john will be home. at least i'm getting something done. i need to do a lot of things. i need to send transcripts to ut, start looking at pharm apps. and ask john if he is really going to move with me if i go out of state. i will probably get in for next fall but you never can tell. i applied way too late last year and got stuck on the stupid alternate list. ok, next' ",1,-0.118555 -0.366526 0.437474 -0.759471 -0.465868 0.414925 -0.216376 -0.650779 -0.824518 0.174458 -0.216328 -0.168499 -0.266178 1.138255 -0.536301 0.0 -0.04277 0.376228 -0.008102 -0.795527 -0.222777 -0.52426 1.055044 0.549511 0.893098 -0.370255 0.448597 -0.207801 0.287261 -0.214911 -0.438649 -0.461658 0.671233 1.050517 1.376491 -0.75592 -0.495866 -0.550505 -1.391069 0.552297 0.031229 0.759954 0.237471 -0.285656 -0.220254 -0.29538 0.055497 0.024633 -0.401937 0.543156 -0.399639 0.940487 -0.476003 0.664218 1.892189 -1.020784 -1.109151 0.241798 -1.163039 0.14792 1.5422 3.22372 -0.480161 -0.360127 0.985196 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.735327 -0.210784 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.088628 -0.019565 0.470071 -0.09422 -0.167316 -0.451544 -0.155478 0.2861 4.960955 4.428411 4.477115 4.94853 4.342285,1918
" i don't know if i can keep up a stream of consciousness , maybe a trickle, but not a stream. keeping my mind on one thing is kind of difficult these days, but i'm going to give it a shot for the sake of it. i guess, i'll just start rambling, i hate this commercial, geiko is so irritating. i can't stand those talking animal -up front . spokespeople why do they have to do that? it's got to be degrading to any gecko watching, that awful accent. . ugh. you know what else isn't fair. . asking if the class is hungry. of course they'll be hungary. that's like saying, don't wiggle your toes!!! won't happen. i know, because i had an algebra teacher in middle school who liked to do things like that. don't move your toes, can't you feel the sweat in between them? or even better: imagine your gym teacher in a bunny suit hopping backward around the track. bad mental pictures i tell you. that's the problem with an active imagination. mental pictures galore! i've got to find the picture for everything, and i mean everything! can't get away from any of the mental pictures. i wonder if it's allowed for me to turn off the tv, it's not as much fun when you can't look at it. this background noise is not working for me, i'll type with one hand,truning down volume. . . . . much better. oh wow, only 6 minutes in. it's like i'm putting myself on the spot here. purposefully rambling. doesn't that go against one of the major social filters in place? a rambler is annoying. this is very difficult because we're trained not to ramble on, and here we are having to skew the system and just flow . ugh, continuing on, today was a good day. they've all been good ones lately. going back to school after being gone for a year has really made me appreciate the university more. i've had such a renewed optimism lately, which is good because i usually have that cynical person out front for everyone to see. but i guess it's time to try something new and go for the gusto, grab life by the horns, see the light at the end of the tunnel, as it were. it's like the beginning of every semester is a new chance to start over. i like that, and lord only know that i've been needing a jumping off point for a new start. this is it i guess. and what better way to start anew, than with a stream of consciousness?!? maybee i'll learn something about myself from this thing. it'll be interesting either way, won't it? why is it that you never get an itch until you start doing something that you're not supposed to stop? good ol' uncle murphy. he's been really messing with me today. the bus won't come unless i've lit a cigarette, i won't get hit up by petitioners until after i've withdrawn money, all day long it's been this way (wow, that sounded like yoda. tired, i am) nothing like a little yoda reference to set everything straight. ok, blank mind, what do i do , la la la la la la la la la la la what should i have for dinner tonight? i don't want to cook, i'll think of something, and if not cereal is always an option. how about that kin test tomorrow morning? i hope i do well on it. correspondence classes are such a pain if the testing sites aren't convienient. why isn't the ut dec testing center on campus? why does it have to be on lake austin blvd? i don't want to have to go to lake austin blvd at 8 in the morning to take a test. it's ridiculous!! what were they thinking? i guess i'm just ready for something to be easy for once, for things to fall into place. for the past 2 years it's been nothing but aggrevation and frustration and all of the other things that essentially mean the same thing but with many subtle variations. i'm so tired of having to worry about what horrendous thing is coming around the corner. i can deal with the regular things just fine, but the slaps in the face are just grrrr, i hate 'em, life is not supposed to be so difficult, it's not supposed to be easy, but it has been ridiculous. . though i do think think things are turning around. time's up, got a cramp in the back of my right hand and, boy is it hot in here! time to go.

first a bit of background last friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice i guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened i guess i am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now i'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid i wonder why i mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so really i just kid of went on with my life so i'm not dwelling on the crash what i am dwelling on is the fact that i was over the crash in a meter of minutes this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine i'm not more or less kind i don't enjoy life more i even had fun that weekend i don't feel that i am truly any closer to god i am not praying any more not that that is how i judge my relationship with god but even how i judge my relationship a no closer weird i should have done this later on i think better at night but if i wrote what i was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper i would lose these thought so i guess it is better this way i can always rewrite what i type onto paper but then i would feel the urge to revise and i haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet i mean what is what i truly think and feel what is spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what i can put together over time so i haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what i write neater or type it i guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as i think why i write on paper what i this but then even i can't read what i write half the time on a more petty note i am worried about math i just have no idea what to expect but that is something that i can put to the back o my mind i'm trying not to think of anything school related because i want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok i'm worried about math because i don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests oh well ,1,-0.318865 0.198347 -0.272869 -0.318187 -0.701583 -0.125061 -0.443613 -0.083583 -0.736625 -0.488206 8.111509 -0.590446 -0.322095 0.76308 -0.897183 0.0 -0.04277 -0.580847 -0.005358 0.391899 0.099882 0.122833 -1.219165 1.319724 0.044649 0.421926 0.832877 0.495993 -0.692164 -1.231555 -0.662832 -1.430891 0.352564 1.163658 -0.666166 -0.642023 1.954591 0.546557 0.270343 0.605344 -1.038726 0.808985 -0.238266 -1.684065 -1.029782 -1.542652 0.045975 -1.525718 -1.550129 -0.990827 -0.40749 -0.205578 -0.201852 -0.903715 -0.908721 2.582212 5.926392 -0.954251 -0.915247 0.529872 -0.58571 2.151926 1.198478 -0.236024 -0.040389 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.387564 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.070263 -0.422267 -0.235182 -0.451544 -0.408772 -2.416536 4.530745 3.813243 4.681718 4.111958 4.838853,461
"ok, i've just turned off the news so the thing that i have on my mind right now is the up and coming election. i really can't stand gore, he is so robotic, i don't understand how anyone can stomach looking at him or listening to him. now i am debating whether or not to get up and turn off the television or if i should just sit here and listen to the noise annoy me. well i have decided to turn it off, ok that's much better, now i can write a more accurate account of what i am thinking. i really don't know what to write, i have never done anything like this before. my computer is really getting on my nerves because it isn't fast enough to keep up with my typing, and i can't stand all the little red squiggly lines that show what all i have misspelled thus far. i don't like not being able to fix it, and now the phone is ringing and that really bothers me because it breaks my concentration even more. well it turned out to be a wrong number, someone looking for heidi, i know this because my roommate had to answer on speaker phone, now it is ringing again and it was that girl that had the wrong number, this time she just hung up. what a moron, i mean really how much guts does it really take to fess up and say that you were dumb enough to dial the same wrong number twice? not saying that i haven't done it before because i most definitely have but i also told the person i was sorry for interrupting them twice. my computer is really getting on my last nerve. i feel like asking my dad to buy me another one. now that i have said that it reminds me about how everyone always says what a spoiled brat i am for getting everything that i want. i don't think its my fault that my dad loves me so much. i think that my brothers do though. speaking of brothers, i rode out with my brother eric yesterday and that was really fun. i think that if i wasn't so caught up in money and status i would become a paramedic instead of a doctor. oh well maybe i'll become an er doctor. that would be pretty cool. i just watched er tonight and it was pretty good. mark green reminds me of eric's friend jim, he's really nice but he is married to a psycho just like eric is. i used to want to be a psychiatrist but after last night i defiantly don't want to do that. we ran a call on a girl that over dosed on her anxiety medication. all she did was whine about how no one loved her and all of her friends had boyfriends, just like sunni. sometimes i wish that i could be a writer like jd salinger. he is really awesome. i know that this sounds really morbid but i almost can't wait for him to die so that we can read more of his work. and if that sounded bad another person that could keel over at any given moment is ""deep throat,"" from the nixon scandal, i would really like to know who that is. i really don't want these people to die, i mean i wouldn't wish that on anyone, i just would like to find out some more things. oh well i have about two more minutes and i can stop writing this. i'm glad that no one is going to read it because that would be really embarrassing. i can't believe how much stuff i am misspelling. it's like i never attended first grade. well i did fail spelling in the fifth grade but doesn't that make me a genius?

" no heather i did not put your picture up, i don't know why! no i didnt wash it. i really like fight club, i don't know why, actually i do. why did i even say i don't know why, itsd amazing the things you get use to saying so that you will fit in. anyways, i am trying to meet people, and its cool. i use the xcuse that other people haven't been open and maybe they were not, but at the same time, i knowe i am not as openas i was last year. ireally liked my senior year, it went by pretty fast, and i got to do alot of the things that i like to do and wanted to do. i also have really wanted to see my girlfriend and, yea, im debating wether i want to stay at our status of going out exclusively, or whether or not, we should also see other people. would marrying her be all that bad, maybe, or maybe im just sexually attracted to her. i have been playing computer games alot and i have also been studying alot more. you know something that interesting, is that people are always looking forward to stuff and never enjoying the present. do we ever really enjoy the present. sex is cool in the present, and i guess you look forward to that and you also look forward to eating, so maybe we are more like animals than people think. maybe we really arent that advanced. i wonder how much different we are from animals. which brings me to evolution, evolution makes so much sense to me, doesn't it to you? do i need peoples approval on everything?!! we are very gregarious creatures, how can therebe a god, how can there not be i don't know, but i doubt it alot of the time and take things that people might set aside as miracles as simply co incedence. i wonder if im studying enouph, or is there such a thing. do i just want to mak the grade or do i actually want to learn. i think knowing, i mean really remembering all that you study would be aswome. i think the coolest characters in story are highly intellegent. like grand adimeral thrawn, the most intelegent, incredibly intellegent bad guy. he could wipe out whole civilizations and even galaxies, by simply outhinking them, by studying their psychological weaknesses and then exploiting them to take control of them, he did so by being incredibly knoledgeable on his subject matters. he knew something on every topic, and wasd therefor nearly undeafeatable, he didnt need to see the future, he could see it through their minds and the way they reacted to different sittuations. are women evil, is all they care about is guys, i mean really what is there purpose in the grand scheme of things. all they ever do is complain, there is always something wrong with them, they only care about themselves, and they backstab each other all the time. they're frekin evil. they're all about appearences, nothing is as it seems with them, i mean what the hell is wrong with them, don't they have any loyalty towards each other, all they evercare to do is kill each other over. are people only angry at the people like them, because they can see through them, they see what these similar people are doing, and hate that they exploit people the same way that they do. is that all we do, exploit other people, is there such a thing as love. or is it just made up, or is love just a selfish thing to benefit yourself. i mean i want to be unselfish and i want others to be unselfish, is that even possible. is everyone like everyone else, are there any individuals, or is it just a giant struggle to be unique and cool. why are we here, is there a purpose to this big mess, i mean what are we supposed to do, what is the purpose of having life if all you will have is eventuall death, why did life create itself, and how is it that your cells retain thoughts. i mean how do your cells keep your thoughts, i don't understand that. i mean how do they work together to keep your thoughts and memories. the brain is such an interesting thing and it is very amazing indeed, and i would like to know about everyone elses brain sooo i could, use that information, i would like to have as much knowledge as grand adimeral thrawn, but then again who would'nt isnt that interesting, how alike we really are, and that we are in deed a product of our parents enviroment.

"i feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes, but at the same time am overjoyed to be here. i spent a year at stephen f. austin for my freshman year of college and liked it alright, but the school was not right for me, i think it had more to do with the town than the school, but anyhow i like being in austin and love being around old friends, but at this moment i feel as if i haven't gotten into the school year just yet. i haven't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient, worthless. but i don't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year. two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me. right now i feel relaxed, relieved to be through with classes today. tomorrow is another day and i feel like i have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished. another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment. this is the first day i have been able to get into the ugl computer library and luckily i made it in before the deadline. i tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines. these are so much better than the computers from sfa that i think i shall nut my pants. one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles, such as uncapitalized letters, lack of punctuation, all borders are allowed to be crossed and i love this freedom. i am feeling very good about myself right now i have just completed my first assignment of the year, well almost completed. i hope i have done this right and this has actually been fun. i look forward to writing on this assignment again. i have 4 more minutes to write i think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer . i am thinking about how this will be graded . i wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what i am writing in real time. and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not . i think i may stay here all day i like doing work and doing work well i am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that i may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors. i love school what else do i need to accomplish? i have to sign up for some experiments as well i'd best do that also. i am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed. i think i have wrote enough but am not sure. so anyway i am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime. this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced? experienced, and to learn how the brain works is good to, and to learn how the world works , that's good to i love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane, i am wishing i had a disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style i like it i am going to do it again, . goodbye i am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes. i wonder what i will wish i had accomplished when i look back ten years from now. like i look back and wonder when did i think i would be right now ten years ago? hmmm that's ponderous man really ponderous. i am glad to be here rather than home because at home i can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that i have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes. like if kori came over i would never do homework again. yeah.

"in the eighteen years of my life i've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. i was born with one. in my heart i bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. what is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. i believe that education can free a man. an educated society becomes more aware. it can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. it has become my belief that i or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. the conscience in me longs to make a difference. to scream at the top of my lungs, ""this is wrong! you are wrong! give back his rights! give back what does not belong to you!"" but i know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. this gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, i am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. my first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. more likely i am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. within me i feel no intimidation toward others strengths and i take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. determination is the driving force of my soul. being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. i know only if i want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. it seems forever that i have expected highly of myself. with every aspect of my life i feel a certain pull to be the best i can be. rarely do i accept being less. my love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. i cannot accept just reading new knowledge. it is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. this allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for i do not like being put in the dark. i must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. this gives me confidence and strength. hopefully, i will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world.

"i don't know i fell kind of weird talking to a computer. well today has been a really strange day. i didn't start school until 2pm so that was great. it lets me get lots of sleep. i think if i didn't get enough sleep i would be more stressed out then what i already am. ok feeling weird again. i don't know what to type about. ok, well yesterday i realized this guy that has three classes with me. so that is kind of cool. i went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes. we later found out we had another class together, philosophy. it is such a big class, i was not surprised i never notice this guy was in my class. after that i went to read by psychology book because i'm kind of behind on my reading. today i finally caught up. i feel better in that sense, but i'm still behind in my other courses. it's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time. but i see other people and they seem to be doing less work then i am. they are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating. if none applies then i kind of feel sorry for them. this weekend i finally get to go home. i'm kind of happy to go back because i miss my baby sister. she is like one year old, so i hate to miss her growing up. she is really funny and i love her a lot. when i'm at home she follows me everywhere. as for my parents i miss them too, buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them. more stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress. "" i love my parents and all, but i like living on my one; well kind of, still have a roommate. when i go back home i get preferred treatment. this is because my parents miss me a lot. i'm actually not that home struck, i don't find it too difficult to live afar. i think this is partially because i know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away. i do feel sad that i'm not spending time with my family though. in this sense i feel inhumane, because i made the final choice of coming to austin. well it seems like half my time is over and i am starting to run out of mind speech. ok, i'm just typing to type. well, then that water bottle looks really good about now. i actually find college possible as long as i find time to study. that is the hard part because i spend most of my time walking from class to class, cleaning my room, doing laundry, taking a shower, eating, or just relaxing for a moment. there are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time. it's kind of aggravating but i guess that's just the way life is. i guess someday i'll get to rejoice in all that i have accomplished in the far future. i am scared of failure, but i deal with it. it's not the end of the world. i like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else i will use it as an excuse to not do something. i think psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific. i was like wow, i remember reading about that but don't exactly remember the detail to answer the question. that is another thing i am afraid of. not being capable to learn all the stuff i need too. i know that if i gave myself enough time, like years i could definitely remember the details. but in the allotted time i have to learn all this information, along with other classes, just thinking about it makes my head hurt. i can't picture myself learning every single thing the book has. especially when i have 5 books, and i have to learn almost all the information in all the books. yeah, well i got my head hurting again. one good side is that this typing thing is almost over and i can continue studying. although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life, this is what actually goes on in my head all the time. especially the headache part. i think one of my major weaknesses is my english. basically i learned english from tv because no one at my house spoke it. i guess my first language was spanish, until i began watching tv and understood it. i hate having weak english skills though because i always below average. i guess its the one thing i'll never be good at.

"what is my problem? i have got to be the biggest bum on the planet. does that mean i have some kind of psychoanalytical problem? i don't know about complexes and childhood mistakes but i do know that there is really something disturbingly lazy about my attitude towards things. what kind of person could put his entire future on the line by not taking care of his college responsibilities? i am that kind of person. i'll probably drop out of college or something and what's even worse is that i see the problem staring me right in my face but i am either to lazy or to apathetic to change my situation. maybe i am a combination of both. honestly, what will my parents say? well, my dad will probably be relieved that i came back home to him. not in the way most families would be relieved though. he would just have another speech to hang over my head after every other mistake i may make in the future. he will probably totally dominate on me like he used to back in the day. he literally did not care about how you felt. maybe that is not quite accurate. i am convinced that he cared about people, and he cared about the family structure as a whole, however his total control over everyone in the house was clear and unbinding. he probably would have defended us with his life, i am sure of it. it is ironic; he would die for us but he wouldn't compromise with us to save his life. compromise? never! god forbid! i know it cannot be that hard to prioritize. wait a minute. how funny is that? i of all people have no business trying to tell someone to prioritize especially when it will be a god sent miracle if i turn in all my assignments this semester. but maybe, just maybe i have stumbled on to something here. i mean, well, what is the point i am trying to make? maybe i recognize similarities between my persona and the people i have associated myself with over the years. duh that's a no brainer. but it is interesting the way one can tell. with my friends it is very, very easy to see that we all talk and act and think alike. sometimes we deliberately change ourselves to fit the mold. with people you dislike it is very different though isn't it? it seems that what we see in them we hardly see at all. i can feel, if almost by instinct, that he and i have some very serious related issues, however one doesn't just stumble over them in his summation of the days events. a person has to be writing on a day very much like today, working on an assignment, very much like this one, following his ""stream of consciousness. "" whatever that means is almost beside the point as far as i am concerned. maybe this is like a journal or something. maybe i should start writing a journal or something. i can be like ""captain james t. kirk"" writing his ""captains log.

" i guess i will talk about the guy i was dating before i came here, since i just got off the phone with him before i got on the computer to complete this assignment. after dating him for two months i realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. there are no straight rules to follow. everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. at first i was so confused by this guy because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. after just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. i think that is weird. i guess i will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. i still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but i am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. i had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. i was thinking i could never do that. i think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. because i believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and i are not together. i thinki'm still new to the dating thing because i don't understand it. i try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. i have mostly dated older people. my first real boyfriend was seven years older than i. that relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than i was. his majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. i think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. after breaking up with him i felt i needed a boyfriend and i even felt a little lonely. now i am fine and mostly dated for fun i guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. i gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others i find attractive or of high standing and what i don't want my future husband to have one day. not to say i am definitly marrying someone but i hope i will find that right someone. for right now though i am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before i ever get married i want to have finished school for my own personal goal. you can't always rely on others in life so if i get a good education i can get a good job to support myself. this has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. because that someone else might not always be there. this has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. i hope i fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what i was thinking about. i feel confused by relationships and i guess i should be and i am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. i just hope everything will work in the long run and so i'll try not to worry about because i used to worry about things to much that i would stress my self out.

" no what do i write about?i'm typing in a computer lab,and i'm surprised there are only a few people in here. it is cold in this computer lab. it has gotten a lot colder in the past few days. i have a quiz in chemistry and i need to study. my roommate must be wondering where i am. its really different in college. i have a meeting at 7 tongiht, i need to study for my quiz. there is a bunch of paper next to my desk, i wonder who left it. the girl next to me is typing a paper, and another girl just walked in the computer lab. she is wearing a red shirt. i need to eat before the cafeteria closes. it closes really early. the computer next to me keeps turning on and off by itself. someone else walked into the computer lab. he is wearing a blue shirt and jeans. the screen of the computer to my right is green. the room is starting to feel colder. i need to get my jacket. there are noises outside the lab, it sounds like a bunch of girls. i just submitted my math homework and made a 100. i wonder if i misspelled any words in this. i am feeling overwhelmed as i think about all the quizzes i have thursday and friday, and i still haven't gotten my calculus book. i started to feel sick today, maybe because of the change in weather. i need to get some sleep. this room is really quiet. i see people walking outside of the computer lab. i wish i could go home this weekend. i kind of miss my family, but it is nice here too. i really like my apartment, i need to wash dishes. someone left the computer lab and knocked something over. someone walked in with a green shirt. i wonder how to drop this yoga class i was put in. maybe i could stay in it. it might be easy. i feel really stressed about school, i hope i can get a 4. 0, i really like my biology and chemistry and psychology classes,they are interesting. only 5 more minutes. i need to run tonight. its getting darker outside. its almost 6. the cafeteria closes at 7:30. i'm feeling tired, but i have so many things to do. and i need to get some medicine. i wonder what my roommates doing, probably watching tv. real worlds on tonight. i wonder what my quiz will be like tomorrow. i hear people talking outside.

"well, lets see, what am i thinking. all i ever really have time to think about is school. i am so stressed out, since i changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, i'm reading for hours each day and i'm not a big reader"", i read very slow, and i have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. to top it all off i have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and i have another one the thursday before that. talk about brain overload. one thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff i'm reading in all 3 classes and some of it i'm finding in my psych readings too. it's all just overwhelming. this week i have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. i was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but i had class from 12-5 so she was home when i was done with class, so i'll be doing that later and i have to buy all this stuff for it too, i don't have a job, i don't make money, and i don't feel like i should ask my parents for more. the big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $700, that's a lot of money i could really use. i could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, i have all this other crap i have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. he is not in school, he should a job, why to i have to loan him money, well no more-ever. well at least not until i get my money back. to top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, i don't a boyfriend who's in jail, i want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 5-10 years. but it's so hard because i love him, or at least i think it's love, it has to be or else i wouldn't put up with all his crap. it's not just all that, i'm somewhat of a neat freak and i like things to be clean and keep things the way i have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff i've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because i'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that i would even get upset. now he keeps saying are things going to ok when i get out blah, blah, blah. i don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than i can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what i get from school, i don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. i should probably end it, i know i won't cry-i'll miss him but i've already cried enough for him. you know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. i don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. one good thing that came from him is my kitty, bailey. one of his friends couldn't keep her so i took her. she is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. i feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. she is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but i still feel bad, i didn't do it to hurt her but i know sometimes she is in pain. that was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing i have to do for her. she is about 6 months but she is still relatively small, i'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. the world's biggest cat weighed 87 pounds, i can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. i just think that's incredible. wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done.

"i don't really want to do this assignment, i think it's tedious and i want to go to sleep. i haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. i want to study, but i'm totally lost at what i want to do because i have so much work to do. i think i will study psychology first before i study my ee book. i miss my brother, he's so cool. looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. this music in the background is cool, i'm glad i burned the cd today. i hope my dorm mates don't get mad that i'm turning it up so loud. i don't really care that much though. i want to go do something besides work. everyone around here is studying, but i am not. i feel like i'm forgetting to study for something. i wish i went to see that movie last night, it sounded really cool. my neighbors are great, but i don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. i don't understand why i don't trust anyone. i wish i could trust people more, but i think i trust too much already. i don't know. i think i'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. houston seems so far away from here, i miss my family. i don't understand why people don't miss their family here, i seem to be the only one. i try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. i want them to be near me. the houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. the concert i went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. it was strange, off all the concerts i went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. it must be the type of music it is. i wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. but, i hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. i don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. man, my trash can is full, when i'm done i think i'll throw out the trash. why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. i hope that my computer doesn't crash again. it's built well, but i seem to be slacking off on computer studying. i don't know as much as i did or wish to. i love computers so much though. i wish i could be rich like those million or billionaires. but, then again, i don't want to be too greedy, maybe if i could just provide enough for my family. i think i wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what i do. i hope ee is what i like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. i don't think i like writing this. my hands are getting kinda strained. i think i'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, i still have another assignment to do, wow, i'm glad i remembered to do this assignment, i don't want a bad grade only 4 weeks into the school year. okay, i think i want to finish this up. thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, i hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. i think ill stop now. bye.

"being at cllege is a new experience for me and i think that it is giving me a sence of being dependant on myself. i like all the new freedom that i have gotten, but i also am homesick a lot. i miss my parents and being in my house in houston. there isn't anyone to make sure that i do everything that i am supposed to do. i am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that i am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, i am getting worried and that is gettting me scared. i have a lot of thing s that i need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. it makes me very frustrated and annoyed at the same time. i feel like i should be a lot more organized and up to date with everything. i am a very organized person, even a ""neat feak,"" and that is why it's driving me crazy when i am behind. i think that if i work hard, then i will do alright. last weekend, i went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so good to be home. i was able to go driving around and i knew where everything was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that i just need time to settle into ut, and then i will be in more control. austin is never going to be ""home"" for me, but it will be a place that i can come to enjoy. i don't think that any city can compare to houston because that is where i grew up and that's also where i have all of my family and friends. sometimes i think about how life would be like if i was adopted or even if one or both of my parents were dead. i look back and don't think that i could manage. my parents play a very important role in my life and i don't think that i would be the same person that i am without them. i know a lot of people that have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough times and they are doing well now, and i give them so much strenght and poer for being able to do that. if my mother would pass on, i think that i would really go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that i would become very quiet when usually i am very outgoing and lively. many things don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. i usually don't cry in movies, and i don't care to become very emotional all the time. i have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. no matter how depressing the news, i am unable to show my emotions. that is something that i think that i get from my parents, specifically my mother. i think that i have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical qualities from my father. i think that i am able to be the person that i am because of my parents. they helped shape me into the person that i am. there are friends that i have been close to in high school, and ever since i have come to ut, i have not been as close to. i don't know the reason for the change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have not tried as hard to keep in touch. i have heard that things like this happen and that you make all of your really good friends in college. i know what people say, but i have a really good friend at trinity and me and her have keep in touch really well. i think that she is an exception to the ""rule.

"this is kind of weird. i never set aside just some time for me to type and write and think. it's crazy that my thoughts are not really coherent. tiffany is typing next to me--her music is loud and kind of weird. i'm not a big fan of rap. wow look at how the font looks smaller after you don't capitalize. tiff's talking to me and going into the bathroom. stupid homework. i am typing but i don't know what i'm thinking about. man it's so loud in our room. she's yelling at me. she wants me to finish my work so i can talk to her. silly girl. the tv is kind of annoying i want to turn it off but it's so far away. college is making me lazy. that reminds me of dante's inferno. i can hear the wretch is that how you spell it? wrench clanking in the background. tiffany is struggling to put our brand spanking new fluffy toilet seat onto the crappy and dirty jester toilet that who knows how many people have urinated in gross!! i realize that even though i am writing my thoughts down as i type, some of my thoughts are not being recorded in this stream of consciousness writing because my mind is going crazy and i can think about a billion things at once but i can't type it all fast enough. stupid fingers! type faster! type faster! this is such a crazy assignment. i love how unstructured college is. i love how you can do whatever you want and no one gives a damn. it's pretty spiffy! some girls is getting her face redone for plastic surgery. i'm glad i'm not heinously ugly or i'd be tempted to get some plastic surgery done too. crazy. crazy reminds me of a song. can't remember which. man i kind of miss high school. those days of knowing everyone in all of your classes--- i'm sad that they are over. now i walk into class and i'm lucky if i know one person. got to meet some friends. but stuart is kind of holding me back. i love him but i don't know if i can take his clingininess! he's such a sweet guy but i wonder what it would be like to be single again. wow look at how much i've typed. i love my new ibook. it's so cute. i just want to look at it all day. how cute is it! right. dang i'm weird. noises in the background are distracting me now. too bad i can't reach over real fast and turn off the stupid tv. i really think that tv dumbs people down. interesting. my fingers look weird when i type. they look like little spiders. ha-ha. website! that's the weirdest word. weird. indweirdo. too bad jaya and i aren't really friends anymore. she's in psycho with me though--maybe we can rekindle out old friendship. shelby was so mean to me. oral interp man-- at least i made some more friends. don't need friends like that anyways. jesus!! lover of my soul! jesus! i will never let you go!!! dang i wish that i could see jesus now. i know that faith is what makes him real to us, but wouldn't it be cool of they could make some jesus bears to hug when you're sad? i miss my parents a lot. actually, i just miss my mom!! *sigh*. it's all good. frederick the printer. ha-ha bio ii. such a good class to go to. i love the learning, hate the quizzes and tests. high school was hard. waking up early to study, staying up late to study. bummer! and all to get into a college to repeat the cycle all over again. man it's weird not to have my parents around! why do people have rhinoplasties? they're so nasty! ccccccccccccccrunk is what that is! tupac. why do people die? i so do not even get it. i think about death in that it's scary. i believe in jesus, so will i definitely go to heaven?

how do you know you won't get sick of them? 911. scary day. stuart's birthday. the phone is ringing. the door opens. flip flops are dirty. i feel like a loser sometimes. but this is not a cry for help. i love you jesus! hahha i hope whoever reads this doesn't think i'm a loser. the little aim man looks funny. i can't wait to read this after i'm done with everything. i want to see what i was thinking. kim basinger and this dude are on tv for this new movie. who sometimes movies really scare me. like sarah michelle gellar in the new movies. tiff is wailing. she forgot about a homework assignment. uh-oh. doesn't sound good. my tummy feels weird. i think i'm getting fat. out!! peace ",0,-0.21404 0.705838 0.004024 1.069811 1.121773 0.211817 -0.344888 -0.129819 -0.262849 2.419941 -0.268189 0.360684 -0.926261 -1.358221 -0.429843 0.0 -0.04277 -0.883705 -0.827709 -0.303709 -0.955084 1.049409 -0.085338 -0.138828 -0.624052 -0.377316 -0.980163 -0.256197 1.874269 0.545334 0.89259 -0.723127 2.237089 -0.263099 0.584835 1.019736 -0.110252 0.373993 0.176888 -0.391208 -0.159747 -0.917988 0.204806 0.10448 1.219629 -0.722934 0.007733 0.214756 -1.042248 0.149042 1.766046 -0.884323 -1.325748 0.342985 -0.607359 -0.661138 -0.178827 1.010882 -0.720074 -0.508416 -0.818129 -0.823105 2.300926 2.418222 0.921507 0.389509 -0.086094 1.300323 -1.030041 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.098274 3.296121 1.652175 -0.422267 1.398386 -0.451544 0.146118 1.70882 5.096668 4.514492 4.969748 4.41675 4.869408,2260
"i should have done this assingment sooner. it is a different type of assignment from ones i usually get. it is hard to write out what i am thinking about. i can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe i can but i just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that i think about, especially someone i don't really know. i think that is the reason i put off this assignment for so long. i didn't know if i wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. i don't know if i thought i would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if i just wanted to keep them secret. not that any of them would be embarrassing. i think that i mostly just didn't want to have to write them down. it doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. i was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if i would actually get off at nine. i also thought about an internet friend from kansas who i haven't talked to in a while. but i didn't think those were too interesting to write about so i began to think about other things. it is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. just the other day, i was trying to write a philosophy paper and i thought i would be able to write it very easily. but when i actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. i knew what i wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. i became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause i couldn't expand my thoughts. i believe that i could have written a beautiful paper but at the times i sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and i couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. i htink that i have this problem often, but usually i can overcome my ""writer's block"" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. i think that is another reason i put this assignment off for so long. i made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have ""writer's block. "" i seemed to not be thinking about anything so i couldn't just put my thoughts down. i was also worried about writing about the right things, but i realized it doesn't mater what i write about, it is just supposed to be what i am thinking. these twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and i feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. i have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that i don't have to think too much about them. i just need to write and not worry about how ""stupid"" i think they sound.

"i am really tired and bored right now. i am a really bad typist. i am so unhappy with myself, the way i look sometimes. i hate my body. i am in love with this guy and he says that i am beautiful, and goodlooking, but i don't believe him. i need to hear compliments though. sometimes i wake up and i look at myself, and i like what i see, then i go outside, and i see all the other girls, how thin and tan they are, and i suddenly hate my body again. this boy doesn't even know that i am in love with him, and i haven't seen him in a few months, because he went to summer school here while i stayed at home and worked. every time i see him i fall for him all over again. but with distance, i slowly get over him, and think about him less. but he is always in the back of my mind. i feel so comfortable with him, like i can say or do anything and it doesn't matter. i think that he is perfect in that i recognize and accept his faults, and only want him to become more secure with himself. i think that he is a beautiful person. there are things i don't like, but i love him as a whole person, for who he is. and i hope i will see him again soon. i have thought about him since we said goodbye last may. i tried to get in touch, but it didn't work. and now he has a girlfriend and i think it is too late for us. it will always be the wrong time. but i can't stop loving him. has it been twenty minutes yet, i don't think so. oh well. i want to find someone that i can feel a friendship for that i could learn to love that would love me in return for who i am. that is why i love this boy so much. we are such good friends, and he knows so much about me. he is a liar. i'm a liar. we are perfect for each other. except that know he is in love with someone else, and has been with her. i want to be friends with her, but looking at her, i just don't like her, there is just something wrong with her. hopefully they will break up and he will realize he has no future with her. she is still in high school! wont graduate for two more years! she is a little girl. i think that time must be almost up now. goodbye.

""you say goodbye, i say hello"" i'm sure you know it. it just occurred to e that i'm writing to you, such that this would be a letter, well, i don't think that was supposed to be the way it was intended, you're probably looking for that in my letter you some sort of study, eh? well, i guess chalk up one for the ""he wrote this assignment like it was a letter"" category. i do that sometimes i suppose. just kind of drift off into something not quite exactly like what i'm supposed to be doing. i think it's quite alright, however. i don't see how i'll get anywhere interesting in life doing what only is 'supposed' to be done. so, i suppose. wow, i sure do say 'suppose' a lot in my head. what's that a sign of mr. psyc? maybe one day, i'll be able to pull out a book and write off to people what they seem to fit into according to famous psychologists. hopefully not though. hopefully i'll have enough common sense to understand the person, their feelings, and my experiences will guide me to a conclusion on how to help them help themselves without any drugs or unnecessary qualification into a group that some ancient shrink made up. wow, just in time to look at the clock, looks like i'm almost half way there. i wonder if anyone else in the class types this fast. if not, i bet mine's the longest. i seem to have a somewhat active mind, and since i'm typing fast enough to record a good deal of the thoughts i'm encountering, i should have one of the longer entrees. not that that is a good or bad i thing, i don't *suppose* look there, i even had time to put in those neat little asterisks to emphasize that i used the word suppose again. how cute. this thing has to be several hundred words by now. i think i think in short-blocks sometimes. i'm not to sure if that's good or bad. the advantage of short-blocks would be that i'm moving on from one thing to another associated thing pretty quickly, meaning that i'm not stagnating in my thoughts. however, a stagnation in thought can cause a nicer, deeper, if you will, reflection on the topic. usually this allows me to get to a bit further point in the conversation with myself. i wonder what i'm going to eat for lunch. i'm really not to sure. i've got to go to work. or at least i should. i could use the extra money. rrgeeze, i could dick those guys around so hard and they'd still ask me to come back. you have to understand that i'm pretty damn good at what i do, and my co-workers and supervisors all realize this. so, when it comes time for me to go back to school, they all say, ""oh well, you're going to at least stay on par time, right, matt?"" well, i'd really rather not stay there, i'm quite tired of their inability to do much at all properly. but, money is money, and where else am i going to find someone to pay me part-time hours (15 a week) and get $11. 25'hr for it. i don't have a degree or nothing substantial to demand a higher pay somewhere else. just knowledge. i suppose if ""proct"" was some science that not too many people about, then you wouldn't be able to get a degree in ""proct"" so people would have to hire you simply on how much you knew. well, that's the way my job is. granted there are related fields to mine where a degree or a certification can help your resume. but not what i do specifically. so, have you guessed what my field is yet? i've given several clues. i'm now listening to the alman brother's song ""jessica"" it's a great tune. they just jam along to it, but you can tell a piece of someone's love is in that song. i mean, someone laid a piece of their soul into he music, and when they recorded it, it carried right over into it. the kind of music where you get a chill running down your spine, and then you realize what a good mood you're in. you can have chill-sending songs that are sad, but 'i like the happy ones, they are fewer in number than the sad ones. ""jessica"" is clearly about a girl, and a girl and a love that made someone very happy. i hope they enjoyed their time together though, because it sounds like the author is just reminiscing. like it was a summer love or something a bit stronger than that. really like the idea though. very nice all the way around. a summer love that was beautiful and both enjoyed, but for some 3rd party reason, they had to step aside and let fate take its course, and take them away from each other. it's the definition of looking back on the good times, not the bad. it's not an easy thing to do, you must admit, it takes practice to only see the good parts. but also still keep the bad parts in mind for reference. it's like a library, your memory. in proper shape, it lets you check out the good memories to take and enjoy. but the bad memories are reference only. that way you can't get too bogged down in them. or at least that's the way i try to keep mine setup. what do you think? probably think i'm a silly little kid trying to edge philosophy into an assignment to impress you? not really, the thought occurred to me, but how would that help me? besides, wouldn't be very honest now would it? lots of rhetorical questions there, eh? well, i've only got a few seconds left. so know that all this is straight out of my mind, and frighteningly enough, it's this active all the time. i may just be sitting somewhere, but i'm thinning away. surely a pscy thinks that's good, right. all done. 20 minutes right up there.

"my eyes are closed right now and i'm wondering if i'm doing things correctly. i just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. i wish i was there with her right now to talk everything out. its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. i am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. i want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. i'm just very exhausted. i've been going nonstop this entire weekend. just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as i type words on this keyboard. i feel it in my neck and the back. i just want to go to sleep. . but i must go on if i'm going to finish all my assignments. i'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. i think i'm going to do my psychology tonight. and here i am. i'm tired but i don't want to sleep. i don't want my weekend to end. it's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . if i don't sleep yet, maybe i could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. i've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. now i am wondering whether i'm doing this right. how can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. i'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think i'm insane after reading this. i rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. how can we truly define that word? i think everyone has a little insanity in them. just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term insane pretty difficult and complicated. it's not like there is a standard of being sane. everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? i think its amazing how i wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. i have another thought. my uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. are they insane? how could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them? i wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the ideal normal i don't think they do because schizophrenia is their normal. besides, who is to judge the ideal normal? i read a book by timothy findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own? i guess this question is a double edged sword. take from it what you will. i still have no idea. anyway, am i doing this correctly? oh here's another thought. . how do you know if i'm doing this correctly. it's my stream of consciousness. whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. for me i think it's normal. i write these kind of thoughts in a journal. i think the only reason why i'm sort of unsure is that i'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment. i am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. i'm actually kind of relaxed now. more sleepy. i think my 20 minutes is up.

"the first sensation i feel while beginning writing is the hard carpet of the dorms at dobie on my elbows because i'm lying on the ground with my laptop, but then again, at least the floors aren't wooden like the floors at the other dorms, so i really shouldn't be complaining. also, my eyes are burning because i'm tired and want to go to sleep, i sleep a lot less in college because during the day there's constant noise and people and it's so much more fun to walk out in the hallway or go to the lobby and talk to people and see what's going on than to sit in my room and study, and since i don't study and do homework during the day i do it late at night when there are no distractions. if i stayed at jester, i'd go to the library to get work done but i'm too lazy to walk from dobie to jester. this assignment is pretty easy and a whole lot better than sitting and doing my calculus homework which i have yet to do but i just looked at the clock on my laptop and it's only been 2 minutes since i've started and 30 seconds was when i got up to get a pillow to put under my elbows. my eyes are tearing now i don't know if tearing is a word, but they're getting watery from staring at this computer screen too long. i'm supposed to continue writing for 20 minutes straight and say what's on my mind and what i feel?? what if all i can think about is how i wish i was in bed, i think it's the music i'm listening to that's putting me to sleep. it's trance music, because that's what i have downloaded on my computer from napster, i hope they don't shut down napster. the courts are right about how the people who actually made the music (my roommate just called, i got all excited that my phone rang this late at night, i'm not a nerd, it's just that, i think it's this guy i know in okok back to napster) the people who make the music don't get their share and i understand and napster really should be shut down but i don't want it to because it's so nice to just type in the name of a song and there you have it, especially when they're old songs you haven't heard for a while. i love music, all kinds of music, it's the coolest feeling when a song brings back memories, or reminds you of people and events. it's 12:30 and i have to stop at 12:42, i hope i'm doing this assignment right because it's too fun,, it's kind of like a diary, maybe this could be our final??? does the professor even read these essays that people write because i can't imagine reading 500 something essays about absolutely nothing even though those are the best kind, kind of like seinfeld a show about nothing that everybody loves. the music i'm listening to makes me think of illegal drugs, this is the kind of stuff people listen to when they're on ecstasy, it enhances the experience, i wonder why people need other things to have fun i understand it, but the world would be a better place if all the drugs were wiped off the face of the earth, but if that was going to happen, you might as well get rid of alcohol too, and nicotine and sugar and caffeine or anything that alters the mind, which is just ridiculous. everything's here for a reason, i don't understand how people first invented and figured out stuff about drugs, i understand it when they grow out of the ground but stuff like pills, how were they invented did someone just put a lot of stuff together and try it and they found a combination that worked??? i'm scared for my younger sister, she's in the 5th grade, and there's so much going on now, with drugs and all, it's everywhere you go, and when she's my age, it will probably be so much worse, and so readily available, and curiosity is such a crazy thing, and no matter your willpower no matter what people always told you, you still want to try, and all the things we learn in elementary school about what to do and what not to do i think they bring in the whole forbidden fruit issue. i remember in 8th grade thinking ""how can something be so powerful that it can make you do things you never would, and make you steal from friends, and make you feel so good that you would do anything to get it. i would try it, just once. "" i can just imagine my little sister thinking like that. and you can't even shelter anyone anymore, because it's everywhere. you can't take her out of one school and put her in another, because it'll still be there, rich school or poor, minority or strictly white. it scares me to think about our generation in 50 years, because i can just see the damaged brains and the lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. yuck i'm not even tired anymore because thinking about stuff like this gets me excited and ready to argue with someone. my twenty minutes are almost up and i could talk forever about what's on my mind, i always think about a lot of things which isn't really good because i can never fall asleep ok that's 20, time for calculus ",1,0.350773 -0.964315 0.920829 -1.060846 -0.804062 -0.490692 0.265367 1.335344 0.763479 1.208213 0.29244 1.280798 -1.039011 -0.563173 0.232389 0.0 -0.04277 -0.711038 -1.300753 -0.307556 -1.455218 1.627985 -0.586619 -0.108847 -0.25765 0.773955 0.008852 0.229643 -0.729368 -0.100183 -0.381236 -0.260509 -0.93583 -0.339005 -0.632442 -0.597226 0.494177 1.831225 -0.073017 -0.213996 -0.263522 0.036025 -0.063161 0.142009 0.322763 0.264697 -0.052908 0.000335 0.233724 0.091553 0.540543 -0.275521 -0.71875 -0.783376 -0.398995 -0.197656 -0.102143 1.212155 1.244606 -0.244074 -0.159081 0.661325 -0.480161 -0.187213 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.715855 1.389131 0.125079 -0.23436 0.896848 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.053087 1.541225 0.169646 -0.225255 0.10337 4.601282 3.648829 4.595451 4.672723 4.891338,1433
"humm. this is very different from anything i've had to do before. my finger really hurts right now because i cut it last weekend, pretty deep too, i probably should have had stitches but i didn't. now i'm going to have a scar on my finger tip and it really hurts to type anything, especially on this keyboard because i'm in a computer lab. i'm not used to this keyboard, i like the one on my laptop but my room mate is asleep so i can't really hook it up right now. i wanted to just plug the internet into my laptop somewhere else, but i couldn't find anyplace, i tried the port in the study lounge but it's disabled. then i had trouble getting on a computer here. i don't have an if account because i'm in the business school, they just gave us the logins for that and i've never needed anything else. i'm just glad my friend came along because he logged on and let me submit this. i'm kind of tired. i haven't been sleeping well, i'm used to sleeping from like 8:00 in the morning until like twelve or one in the afternoon. this weekend i didn't sleep friday night, and i partied saturday night and didn't go to bed until like six in the morning on sunday. i slept like nine hours then though because i had been up for forty-six. this week has been weird hours too. sunday night i slept for like two hours, that wasn't bad, my body only needs like five hours of sleep or so before i wake up and can't go back to sleep. anyways, two hours sunday night, then i got four on monday night, none on tuesday night, and then about three and a half last night. now is like 4:30 i think, the clock on the computer says 3:39 but i think it's wrong because i thought the clock on the wall said like 4:15 when i came in from smoking a cigarette. mmm. cigarette sounds like a good idea but i have to study some more after this. the sleep schedule that i have is kind of weird with classes in the morning, but i've been doing a lot of studying lately. i hang out with my friends during the day and then study with a few of them at night. tonight it was me and my friend cimu and kenchi studying, cimu went to bed at like 3:30 or so. kenchi is here now thank god or i wouldn't have been able to do this until the morning when my roommate wakes up. she goes to bed at like 11:30 and sleeps until like 10:00 in the morning. i don't understand how a person can sleep that long, i can try to go to sleep at a decent hour but it doesn't matter because i have to lay there for like an hour and a half before i fall asleep. then once i finally do get to sleep i only sleep for like four or five hours, i just wake up, not to go to the bathroom or anything but i can't ever go back to sleep. i hate it when my alarm clock hasn't gone off yet and i wake up. if it's just like ten minutes before its set to go off, i don't mind. but when i wake up and there's an hour and a half or two hours left to sleep and i can't go back to sleep it sucks. then i just have to lay there and be board when i could be studying. at least i found some other people that like to stay up all night though. shaun is really cool, the other night we stayed up the whole night because we weren't really tired. he likes to sleep during the day but i just don't like to try to sleep. we hung out earlier in the day and then studied all night in the lounge beside the jester desk. we could have gone to a study lounge i guess, but we both have laptops and ",0,-1.902735 0.684111 2.074287 0.615469 -0.341056 -1.132054 -0.908889 0.119755 -0.940724 0.219897 -0.055253 -0.590446 -0.983526 -0.171949 -1.16622 0.0 -0.04277 -1.205982 -0.472317 0.529348 -0.355782 -0.742368 -1.0069 -0.90012 -0.624052 0.897581 0.920347 2.671409 -1.487446 -1.602746 -0.449524 -1.430891 -0.40178 -0.521152 -0.232929 -0.414133 -1.436141 0.3686 -1.685696 -0.201001 -1.038726 -0.116973 -1.159087 -2.059471 -1.429535 -0.806591 -1.093488 -1.429818 -1.220821 -1.073357 -0.881101 4.568829 0.543482 -1.584468 -1.307851 1.274073 2.616699 0.222137 0.810138 0.090324 0.477637 -0.762859 -0.06395 -0.745201 -0.170122 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.7558 0.237531 0.870683 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.138613 -0.422267 0.961179 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.090555 4.515869 3.824112 4.87567 4.550702 3.949903,1974
"i am here in ut's library. i just finished talking with my mum on line. she is back in china. thought she is far away from me, every time i am talking with her, i feel that we are really close to each other. it is 7pm on monday night, but i don't really feel hungry, though when i am thinking about the lunch i brought here with me, i feel like having it. some fruits and a corn. though this is the beginning of the semester, i feel like i am having a lot more to do than usual. i guess this is the difference between big unversity and a small college there are five classes i am taking this semester. except the markering one, the lecture are all fine to me. however, i bet the exams going to be hard. i have to work hard to get a good gpa, then get into the program i want. the work on campus is all right. not so fun and changlleging. kind of boring. i am not really learning a lot from it. the good thing is that one of the bosses is nice. he makes me feel like there is someone appreciate my 4 and half hours work in the morning. i guess, people usually using new ones harder. i don't see anyone else working as hard as i do. basically, everyone is chatting and eating. frankly, i'd rather work instead of chatting. but just not like this. you know what i am saying? anyway, i hope i am going to get used to it soon. i love to cook my own food. saving money and tast good. but i just don't have much time to do so once school starts. so basically, i bring simple food to school or just eat somewhere else. i have lot needs to be done tonight and hopefully i will survive tomorrow.

"i am not exactly sure how this is supposed to work, but i will give it a try. i am wondering if i am thirsty because i see the aquafina bottle on my desk. i know i will jump to a random thought soon. i just have not figured out exactly what it is. i am thinking about going to my next class at 5:00 for the cal discussing, and i am wondering if there will be any good looking guys coming today. there are a few cute ones, but who knows why they won't say hello. i myself don't think that i am totally unattractive, and on occasion i have been known to look hot. now one of my friends would think that she was cuter and had a better body than me, but i do not think so. so anyhow that makes me think of how we went bowling the other day and that she did look like she had lost some weight because her pants looked good on her. she also has great hair, that never looks clumpy, how does she manage that? o just go to the store and buy any shampoo that i want but not her she buys the most expensive thing at the mall, we are so different, yet so alike. maybe i just like to put on the image that i don't care when i really do, while she cares and she admits it. right now i feel like turning on the tv so that i don't fall asleep while i am typing this assignment up. i always get sleepy around this time but i feel so guilty taking a nap because i have so much work that i should be doing. right now i hear rosie o'donnell in the background and they are talking about nyc and now i want to go hang out in new york with my friends and i also want to go each some chocolate chip cookies. i am the biggest chocoholic. but my dad has diabetes, so i have decided that i would start to be cautious about what i ate. right now i am trying to keep up with everything i am thinking but my fingers cannot move as fast as all my thoughts. i just saw a picture of a finger cut open, and quite frankly that is one of the most disgusting things i have ever seen. i am not really sure if i like my nail polish color, it is a cool color, but i am not entirely sure that it looks good on me. rosie just mentioned dogs which makes me think of my dog, cleopatra, who i miss very much. she is a black cocker spaniel with white patches on her stomach and, she has beautiful big brown eyes. she is one of the cutest things i have ever seen. she waits for my little brother to come home from school at the window next to our front door. oh yah i want to download dr. dre's new song, but for some reason i cannot remember the name of the song. and i can't get napster, because of this stupid ut network, so i have to use imesh, which is not as good as napster, because i can't just write in the name of a song. i have had quite a bit of computer trouble lately. but luckily it is all fixed and set up now, due to many nice people who have helped me set it up. i am really not computer savvy and my parents always get on my back about it, and i used to not pay attention but now i am thinking that i should, because there are so many cool things that computers can do, and i don't want to miss out. i also want to go shopping, but i don't have money, i want to be like i dream of jeanie or bewitched and just be able to blink in and out of outfits. i saw a campbell's soup commercial that said soup only has 100 calories. now i am watching a bit about a wonderful guy who is very loving toward his mother, which makes me think that i could make more of an effort to be better to my parents. ok my twenty minutes are up so i will stop typing.

"our world is pretty fucked up. i've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with. well not the only thing, but almost the only thing. the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves. between hurricane frances and soon to be hurricane ivan, why do we need chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse. why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right. be it a christian, a muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong. so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too? ""they're religious. they're unstable. they're on medication. they've had a hard life. man fuck that. people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong. i don't understand this blur of morals and truth. how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong? i suppose i'll get off my soap box now, i just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet i know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today. the only thing i can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example. so i was just reading bush has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president. ha. that makes me laugh, i say more power to bush, he says he's clean, i believe him, i don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john kerry. i don't even want to vote, but i feel its my duty. so who am i going to vote for? its like picking the lesser of two evils? and which one is lesser of a sob than the other one? man i don't know. i suppose i'll vote for bush, being that this is texas. but i don't know if i'd feel right about that. maybe i'll just write in a vote. i mean i know all of texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter? maybe i'll run for president one day? naw, i doubt it, i'm not moderate enough. not that i'm a radical, just that i don't think i could say things to appease one person or another. i have my beliefs and damn it, i'm sticking to 'them. that doesn't mean i'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but i'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business. this feels good by the way. i'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying. i kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since i'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me. so i'll just let them be. my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently. they're a couple years older than me, and i'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her. she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together. i can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it. anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, i can tell things are getting intense. i didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically i was here first so i suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal. she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do. man, i feel sorry for them both. he just wants to love her, be there for her. and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is. love is a funny thing. love is a fucked up thing too. i've only been in love once. and i've fallen out of love once. its a painful process. but then again, i wouldn't replace it. it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that i can completely support. so why is it that humans love? or choose to love? or choose not to love? i'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling. to be able to call someone and just talk to them. see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things. i wonder what my wife will be like? i wonder when i'll meet her. my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married i think. i may be wrong, but i doubt it. i think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul. that's kind of scary. hey, my brother is going to be married forever. i'm going to have a sister in law. maybe i'll be an aunt or uncle soon. now that is really weird. its crazy how time moves. i feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time i feel like i still think and act like a 6th grader. oh 6th grade, those were good days. i thought i was the coolest kid in the world. and at the time, i may have been right. i was one cool 6th grader. it rained today. i love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure. it makes me appreciate the day that much more. i've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today. reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things i can support 100% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least. i ate at freebirds today too, that was so good. i'd say the feeling i have after i eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings i'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world. because when i've finished freebirds, i don't even desire love, because i am so full and content i don't need anything else. its a good feeling. i'm thinking about what i'm thinking about writing. if that makes sense. it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and i'm working on that, but i think that i'm thinking too much about it. i've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now i'm thinking too hard about writing something. its ok though, because i only have like 15 seconds left. maybe i'll eat cookies later tonight, i bet those will good ",1,0.654475 -0.151696 -0.367999 0.032648 0.059413 0.733968 0.142193 -0.0631 -0.14086 2.181382 -0.171587 1.106417 -1.473711 -1.016771 0.10034 0.0 -0.04277 -0.157617 -0.885796 -0.149721 -0.974903 -0.491404 1.381111 -0.465414 -0.333103 -0.113933 -1.141626 0.041596 0.666257 0.23533 1.183501 -0.129779 0.732537 -0.455772 0.818809 -0.702683 -0.025414 -0.058201 0.555043 -0.351092 -0.423159 0.408149 -0.872756 0.699429 -0.55988 0.466576 1.054875 0.631079 0.276694 0.867148 0.288102 -0.70984 -0.506541 -0.271737 0.940607 -0.197827 -0.372527 -0.610195 -0.0798 -0.104574 -0.525812 -0.457379 0.493665 2.577914 0.99563 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.113662 1.720145 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.035047 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.233535 1.698082 -0.451544 -0.263047 1.206101 4.907962 3.903341 4.508224 4.486816 4.985431,2250
"i am constantly thinking about the past. i often think about the good things that have occurred in my highschool years. i feel really sad because i miss my family so bad. i am always thinking about how i never get in trouble anymore because my parents aren't here to get mad at me whenever i come home late. i feel so lonely here. nobody knows anybody. everywhere i turn i see different faces that i probably wont ever see again this semester. i feel so depressed because my boyfriend is gone. i am always dreaming about being together again, but its not going to happen ever because we just broke up. i miss him so bad and i can't ever be with him anymore just because i have too much darn pride. i wish i didn't have so much pride. pride gets me nowhere all it does is leave you wondering what could have been? or where would i be standing now with him had i not been so proud. i am so sad, but then again i would rather have alot of pride than no pride at all. i wonder what i'm going to do with my life. everybody seems to know exactly what they are good at. i don't!! i'm totally lost i don't know what i'm the best at. how are you supposed to know what career is the best one to choose. i want to do good in school but people don't work to the best of their ability unless they have certain goals. i'm not determined. i don't know if i will be successful dancing ballet or operating on some dying person. i'm too confused. i'm happy i have my brother i love him so much i don't know what i would do without him. i'm really hungry . i didn't have breakfast, lunch or dinner because i was too mad about my boyfriend or ex-boyfriend i should say. i can't think or sleep or eat i don't know what to do should i let go of all of this pride that i have? no, it will be better for me in the longrun. why do people get hurt so much. i don't understand my mind knows that things happen for a reason. i know deep down inside that for some reason this happened and that things will get better, but i'm hurting so bad inside and i still want to smile at people and say hi to my friends even when i don't want to talk to anybody. i don't understand why i have to feel horrible and my friends are all having a blast. why do some people live the best life and others don't get it so easily. it's not fair to have some people be happy all the time and others who are born without an arm or who's parent's have died or who have some sickness why them and not me for example?

"i'm here in the computer lab doing this assignment and wondering how in the world are they going to get any information out of what i write. i think there is so much out there that we can't understand and this is one of them. last night i had a weird dream well no it wasn't last night it was the night before i was in a school but i don't recall which on and then someone shot me! yet no one cared. i was all alone and then my family shows up and they seem interested for a while and then they forget about the situation and wonder around without taking me in to and emergency room. i thought it was weird but then again i later on had another dream i don't remember what it was right now but i know that i had to do with lack of attention. i figure these dreams are happening because i'm far away from home and i don't receive the same attention, its just a matter of adapting to different environments. its weird how i'm here in the lab and everyone is in there own little world for instance the girl next to me seem s to be having problems with the computer yet she never asks for help, why? and then there's a girl in front all into her study or research i don't know what she is doing and she looks so interested. i really don't know what else to write i mean those things came to the top of my mind once i started writing but now i don't know. i really hope arturo writes to me this coming week i mean he is in the army and i'm really scared for him specially since his last letter where he told me they were going to send him to iraq. that sucks because i got attached to him. specially at prom the night was so perfect everything was going great until it was time to leave to our houses. i mean why can't i find a guy who's like him i mean he is great he is sensitive, sweet, crazy, funny i don't know i could go on but why can't i find someone? he would be perfect but he is too slim we look like a 10 when were next to each other not that i'm fat but i'm fatter than he is. if he could only gain lets say maybe 25 pounds he would be dream guy material. ericka is changing a lot i don't know what her problem is i think it all turns out to be that she has no goal in life. she knows she wants to be a doctor because that's what everyone tells her but she doesn't really now what it is she want to do with the rest of her life. she is a lost child, all she cares for is fun i mean its important to have fun but everyday? that's just not right. what does she want to have a boyfriend for only for sex? she is always talking about some other guy and this and that and what does she expects from this guy . she changed so much we use to be close friends but now since she is in mexico and has been there for the last year and will be there for the rest of her education i don't even know if i can still call her a friend. it really bothers me how i can get so excited for her when things are going good yet she doesn't care if i'm sad, mad , happy if i need to be hear . its all about her and just having fun talking to people when they're happy and be talking dirty and things of that matter? why!? i don't know if she is always been like that just that i hadn't noticed or she is just changed. her friends over there have great influence on her and i personally dislike them i don't think they will ever do anything with there life's because they're simply not able to work for their money they're so use to asking their dad for money. they don't appreciate the value of hard work or the having a do go to school because eventually that will put food on the table for your children. they are just plain stupid thinking their father will always be around to give them what they want. and now ericka has become just like them and i hate that. this writing helps out . i've always thought this but not a soul new about it and now god knows who is reading this and wondering what the hell is she complaining about. or oh well . i don't know i just had to say it . and now i'm waiting for the 20 minutes to be over using up the rests of the seconds that . oh well they're over.

"hmmm. don't know what to write. maybe erin will call back soon. glad leah is not coming home tonight, place all to myself. fabulous. wonder where melissa is and if she wants to do something tonight. i do, but i am tired and i have stuff to do, but bored with stuff. the room is dark and lonely, but good that leah isn't here. hopefully erin will call soon. haven't been able to have a good conversation with her since she went to california. miss her a lot, wish she were in leah's place. but, she'll be here in four days for dave. dave is coming up soon, i can't wait. wish melissa would go with us, so it'll be less like couples, but preston and carlo will be there, we'll have to see them. they are justin's friends and he probably wants to see them too, probably not as much as he wants to see erin, but its cool, it would be cool to hang out with those two guys. that way i could get preston's number and i could network with what he's doing. it's all about the networking. dave is going to be so much fun, i can't wait, but it would be better if leah and mike weren't going. but what could you do? hopefully justin will take his car and us true dave fans can get there early and not wait for the non dave fans. i'm so tired. definitely bored too. those neighbors are so random, they are always making noise, but they are such dorks. they better contain themselves or we will have a definite problem. and what is kelly's deal? she has totally distanced herself. is it because she thinks melissa and my friendship has become too much or does she just not like me or is it because her friend was in town? i definitely feel neglected. i mean i try to be cool and nice to her. i try to be nice to everyone, i'm nonconfrontational, that's probably why people like me. i don't know. i wish leah didn't take that stupid poster that i wanted. every time i look at it, it pisses me off. god. she is definitely annoying, i swear what a poser of everything, hey maybe you could get an identity of your own and stop stealing everyone else's. fabulous. dave is so awesome, i can't wait. could i love you, could you love me? i definitely need a guy, i am so sick of all these couples, it's so annoying. i mean i deserve a guy, right? it has been a while. i'm just too damn picky, but i am about everything. it's good right? quality over quantity? i hope so. but, more people are more fun and you can always find something to do. i need to find or run into those two girls from the other night, they seemed cool, maybe people i could get along with. mainly that izzy girl, the other reminded me of jakki barsalou and she had some tongue thing, which both could be bad. that stupid bear. god! oh my neck hurts, it's so stiff. i definitely need a good massage. another thing boyfriends are good for. good seeing mom today, definitely miss all that. but, i'm being strong. definitely almost started crying about all of kim's problems today. which is weird, because i hardly know her anymore, but i guess we have some sort of childhood bond. maybe, it is because i feel like i can sort of relate. it was weird, maybe i just need to cry or something, get it out of the system.

" for all of my life, i have been in control; i have been so goal oreinted and focused, but now that i am finally in college, i have no idea what i am doing. i still work hard and am still focused, but i do not know what i am working towards. eventually, i would just like to become a house wife. there is not really anything else i am interested in. furthermore, my boyfriend of ten months and i broke up about two weeks before moving up here. at first i had the hardest time getting over him, but now i am ok. the wierd thing is, i do not miss him, but i miss what we had; i miss what the relationship brought to my life. sometimes it really scares me because i think to myself, what if no one else can offer me something so great as what he offered? my roomate is my best friend, and at the moment both she and her boyfriend are here. i look at them and remember the feeling that i had two months ago and sometimes it makes me really down. i do not really understand myself because i am independent and i know how to be alone, yet at the same time i want that in my life. it's almost like a big fat contradiction. if i am so independent, then why do i want to have a guy in my life? i don't think i'm explaining myself very well. last night i just sat and thought for about two hours. there is so much uncertainty in what i am doing and where i am going. my peers have always looked up to me because i have always been the one that was going to make something of myself, but now i have no idea what i will be doing after graduation. i am doing this writing assignment and my roomate and her boyfriend are being loud. i don't think it would usually bother me, but i think the fact that i don't have a boyfriend anymore makes it bother me. i actually enjoy the single life, but at the same time, i miss having someone to share my thought and emotions with. i talk to my older brother a lot. he's 23 and lives in san francisco. he's a really big factor in my life, always giving me advice and helping me through the rough times. i love the relationship that he and i share because we are more than just siblings, we are really good friends. another thing that i think about is my family. my mom and i are really close. sometimes she really upsets and annoys me, but nevertheless we get along really well. i thought i would cry when she dropped me off, but i barely even teared. when everyone went home for labor day weekend, i stayed here in austin. i didn't want to go home. i didn't miss it yet. i always thought i would be homesick, and the fact that i am not, makes me feel sort of guilty. i miss my mom in the sense that she is my mom, but i don't feel the urge to see her, and that makes me feel guilty too. i am going home this weekend for a doctor's appointment. i think once i am home again i will be homesick. i like ut. it's wierd because college is supposed to be really stressful and i am sure that it will be, but for right now, i think college is really relaxing.

"philosophy. can one truly think that one knows nothing? if one truly thinks that one knows nothing, doesn't that mean that he in fact truly knows something. that he knows nothing. if god is omnipotent can he make a rock so heavy he can't carry it? god. if he were the perfect god why hasn't he made himself present to the entire world? how can this world think so highly of itself that it thinks it has found the right religion already. maybe the true god has never been seen, has never been thought, has never been written down before. there always exists the possibility that perhaps the world came about in a way no one has every thought of before. it's possible and very probable. can one truly put all his faith in god. if god is an almighty, omnipotent being, can one put his entire life into god's hands? but then god says not to be foolish. is it foolish to want an explanation. maybe the confusion is meant for a reason. have to get an application to college of engineering. to be a genius wouldn't be so bad. it wouldn't be that great either. everything has its ups and downs, black, white, heaven, hell, etc. perhaps the goal is to reach a true balance. maybe then we'll be content. then again to be content and balanced you would have to have some discontent. fashion is definitely too emphasized in this world. when will comfort be in? it will probably take off like a forest fire. people will realize there are plenty of more important things than clothes and appearance. of course that doesn't mean stop bathing and wearing dirty clothes. people need to get priorities straight. why waste your time taking a speeding ticket to court. time is money. time is more valuable than money. without time we are nothing. without money, we are without money. time will never wait nor come back. smurfs. i remember smurfs. back in the childhood days when things weren't so complicated. a tiny blue creature was simply a tiny blue creature. not a tiny conniving blue wench searching for self promotion or upholding a social image or making the extra buck. it was a time of snowmen and berry fights and rope swinging and rock climbing and tadpole watching. nothing more, nothing less but perhaps invaluable.

"i am sitting here trying to start writing, but i can't. i have this problem a lot when writing for my english class, because i never do the reading. this year, however i decided that i would try doing the reading assignments, and it has helped me immensley in my classes. however, now that i am doing the reading in my chemistry class, i see no reason to go to class, because my teacher doesn't understand the concept of teaching, so i basically learn nothing. i often wonder if i am too hard on teachers because i want to be one. in my classes, i always seem to evaluate the teacher so i can figure out what to do and what not to do. in high school band, i spent a great amount of time evaluating my band director because i had such a problem with her teaching techniques. i see music education as a field in which you should be a teacher, not a technician. my band director was not a teahcer at all, but only a technician. we never learned a single thing about music, but she was great at teaching kids how to play instuments. my add is kind of annoying at times, because i will be trying to concentrate on one thing, and my mind wanders off to another place. i am thinking about this girl in my music theory class who is very good looking. i think i am going to ask her on a date this weekend. i am not sure what i am going to do though, because my father would not let me take my car to school. sometimes i think he trys to get out of things by procrastination so he can save money. i mean, he gives me everything i need and most everything i want, but i feel that he is trying to make me think he is going to do one thing, and when the time comes he just finds an excuse to not do it. i have tried, however to start holding him to his commitments. part of the problem is the fact that he trys to do too much in a 24 hour a day, 7-day a week week. he never pays anyone to repair anything for him. he does it all. cars, house, electronics. i am glad, however that i have grown up knowing and learning how to do repairs from such an extremely intellegent man. i'm sure it will come in very handy one day when i have a house and family of my own. in fact, it has made me want to have a house of my own so i can have something to work on of my own. i'm excited in general about my future. i want to be a music educator, teaching orchestra. i love music education and orchestra so much, but i sometimes wish i was getting a piano degree, as it is my first love. i have taken piano most of my life, and i greatly improved this year, mainly in the past 3 months. i sometimes wonder why i smoke cigarettes, as it is a stupid habit. why would someone willingly put smoke into their bodies. i guess i enjoy it. i don't know. most of my friends smoke mariajuana, and it doesn't bother me. i, on the other hand, have never done it, and i really have no desire to. my sister was a somewhat heavy weed smoker her first year in college, and she ended up with a gpa of 1. 9. i don't want to get kicked out of ut my first year, and i want to be able to say that is something i have never done. my father works on top secret programs for the government, and he says that if anyone trying to get a security clearence has a history of drug use, they are automatically disqualified. i might want to someday become an engineer, and i would like to do what my father does. that is one of the main reasons i don't smoke weed--i don't want to screw that chance up for myself ",1,0.455165 0.48538 0.886035 0.384075 0.120547 -0.903994 0.048998 0.834368 0.766835 0.121444 -0.106198 -0.590446 -0.348299 1.056634 0.929527 0.0 -0.04277 0.778398 0.719065 -0.566559 0.6061 -0.519923 0.438551 1.571991 -0.624052 0.631154 0.73136 0.500029 -1.312146 -0.44529 0.249247 -0.112881 -1.408868 -0.906028 -0.203937 -1.109326 1.332089 0.94442 0.778995 0.128261 -0.49311 -0.987428 1.222517 -0.732147 0.420458 -0.779407 -0.507571 -0.031996 -0.580035 0.202536 -0.622347 0.115244 -0.739257 0.549969 -0.071982 -0.526784 0.722043 -0.344334 -0.058312 -0.819853 -0.895413 1.583255 -0.480161 0.432994 -0.15621 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.446708 1.404219 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.280321 -0.422267 -0.906109 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.197462 5.071019 4.07619 4.275137 5.245267 4.427592,746
"well, here it goes. i don't know exactly what to write about because my mind is sort of blank to real thoughts as i've been studying all day. but i'll start with what is the most important thing to me right now--loneliness. what better thing to write about when you're listening to bruce springsteen. anyway, it's not the clinical loneliness from which i suffer. it's more of a deprivation i guess. it's a deprivation of emotional intimacy. you see, i have quite a few male friends which is great because male bonding is always a must. but i'm the type of guy who always needs a deep relationship with a girl. it gives me a sort of basis in my life. everything falls into place. i do better academically if i'm in love with a girl and i am more confident about everything i do. i am so much happier when i'm in love. basically, when comes down to it, i love being in love. how do i know? well, i've been there before. i fell deeply in love with a girl in my junior year of high school. yeah, yeah, i know ""you were too young to know what love was. "" i really wasn't. there's a van halen song which says ""how do i know when it's love? i can't tell ya' but it lasts forever. how does it feel when it's love? it's just something you feel together. ' well, i completely relate to the togetherness part and lately i've come to realize that i can also relate to the foreverness part, too. there will always be a place in my heart for shannon. but she isn't the point. she is what was. and life isn't what was, it's what's going to be. all i'm saying is that i know what love is and how to love. i want it back . but it's so hard up here at ut to find it, or so it seems. i should be able to find it because i'm pretty good-looking and i've really turned into a nice person. but every girl that catches my seems so unapproachable. but, there's another factor in this whole game. i'm already in love. i'm in love with someone who lives back in the woodlands. i had a crush on this girl since my sophomore year and somehow we developed a friendship where both of us went through some peculiar twists. you see, we know we both liked each other and we both wanted to do something about it but we didn't. i didn't because i felt that if i told how i really felt, she wouldn't understand and run away from me(metaphorically). she didn't do it because i don't think she knew what she was feeling. she's never been there before so she's not familiar with the symptoms. it took me a while to figure mine out with shannon, but when it happened, i knew the second it hit me. i think it's hit her but she doesn't know what to do. well, my twenty minutes is up so i'm gonna' cruise. but i might actually get on here on do this out of pure enjoyment. you see, i always do this. i always sit down and throw up all this junk onto paper and then sift through the vomit afterwards. it helps when you're stressed. anyway, thanks for listening, and if no one ever reads this i do think bert from sesame street is evil. if you don't believe, get on the net and find the bert is evil website and see for yourself!!!!!!!!!

"anyagreene started instant messenging me randomly a few days ago. he wouldn't tell me who he is. at first, i did't have a problem with not knowing who he was, because the mystery is exhilirating. but after a while, he started to talk like russell. he even knew about russell's death. i loved russell. that night, i dreamed about anyagreene, but in my dream, anyagreene was jeff. i was so happy to see jeff. i was glad that jeff cared enough to im me despite his heartless character and heavy workload. when i woke up, i wanted to fall back to sleep. . i wanted to fall back into the world where jeff still cared about me. it's also a world where russell was still alive. he was alive through this screenname. jeff and russell were the same character in that dream, or at least that's what i thought. i often dream about russell, thinking that he's still alive, only to wake up crying in the middle of the night because in reality, russell hasn't been in this world for a while. after talking to my roommate last night, i realized why i loved jeff so much. jeff was unattainable, just like mr. big from sex and the city. it was exactly his unattainability that attracted me. i thought jeff was my soul mate last year. i've never had that kind of of connection with anyone else in my life. to say the least, i don't think i'd ever be able to forget jeff. i hope we'll be able to go to the same graduate school together. i believe in soul mates. i don't think all soul mates are fortunately enough to end up with each other for the rest of their lives, but they do exist. mine is probably jeff, but due to his bisexual tendencies and his lack of willingness to commit, it didn't work out. how sad it is to thikn that i've met my soul mate when i was sixteen and i missed my one and only chance? my mother's soul mate is not my father. they love each other, but there's this other man that was my mother's best friend and first love. he had such a great impact on her life. just like the way rusell changed my life. but i think in a way, besides the period of depression, russell changed my life for good. after dating him, i got into simon's rock, and now i'm a 17 year old sophomore in college. i saw him again this summer and it was hard not to patronize him because of how pathetic he looked. neal and i showed up in his house when he was selling all of his worldly posessions so he could go away with the girl in the picture who's passed out. i admire his passion, but i would never do something like that. like i've always said before, the reason that he did that was beacuse he could. he has the ability to turn his world upside down and still come on top. . or at least that what i think. back to jeff. . i miss him. but i think transfering to ut was the right decision. i could nto have accomplished anythign with him in the same school as me. i am only productive when i am single and not distracted by boys. i should think about boys less in general. what are the chances of any one of them doing any good to my life? i would much rather listen to play that funky music white boy on my computer, write in this as an effort to be productive and go to pcl when i'm done with this. speaking of pcl, i really need to finish doing my organic chemistry reading, homework. . review'preview genetics and get some physics done today. i guess i can do other stuff tomorrow. i don't have a whole lot oftime left though. i haven't been productive in a long time. i am worried that i won't be able to do what i want to do since i've been so lazy lately. maybe my brain is rusty. but i still have faith in myself. i think i will be able to finish these things. i'm goign to ball room dance tomorrow night. that should be fun. i hope i won't be a wall flower. i need to work out too. i am tired of looking like a loaf of bread. i don't enjoy looking at the fat on my legs. but it's not like i can't change that with an hour inthe gym everyday. it just takes some effort. i need to make some changes in my life, but the good thing with being human is our abiilty and capability to change.

"wow, so here i go. this is actually pretty exciting, i don't think i have ever had such a fun writing assignment. jessica's music is on, her music was playing at the same time as mine, hers was rap, mine was ""honey and the moon"", weird combination. she's still listening to it. i have an aftertaste of godiva chocolate in my mouth, my sister sent me my shirt i forgot. and i was just at drews, across the hall. i wonder how i did on my bio exam. we get the grades back today in our review session. it was stressful but i think i did ok. we'll see i guess. my sheets are bright i wonder what everyone is doing at home right now. let's see. its almost 3, so everyone's working. i miss jude, he's so cute and now that i'm here i'm going to miss out on him taking his first steps, him first talking, etc. but it was fun watching him grow. i miss him the most. it'll be nice to be home next weekend, i want to lay out in the sun by my pool, with my dogs. tonight's going to be busy, with me catching up in all my classes and all. but what i really want to do is see drew, because i like hanging out with him. but then once i get back into my room, and i shut the door, that's when reality sets in, and that's when i realize that i have to stay with scott because he needs me right now. and it wouldn't be fair after all of this. this writing assignment is pretty crazy, i still have awhile to go. maybe i just don't have enough to write about? let me think here. i find myself staring into my panoramic photo of a sunrise on the beach in hawaii. it's a pretty tight picture, and i wish i could just be back there right now, instead of stressing here at school. even though this experience is pretty awesome. i still find myself stressing more than the ordinary college student. my insecurities keep building up , until something or someone comes along and then i'll let them fall down. one of my goals is to be able to walk around with my head raised high up, chin up, smiling, confident. i wish i could be that person, but for some reason i guess i feel too uneasy about my appearances. most likely, that is the result of going to a school with really judgmental people. oh well, it'll just be something i need to grow out of here. that's one thing that i love about ut, no one really cares what you look like, talk like, etc. it's a nice change. last night i had another crazy dream, i want to start writing them down but sometimes i just can't remember them. like last night, some guys broke into my house, and they were chasing us out. but i somehow convinced them with my kindness or something (as i do in many of my dreams that are very similar to this) that they should leave us alone. i just remember showing them my ""mastiff"" dog. ok, is that even a dog, or did i make that up or what. whoa, a crazy thing that came across my mind yesterday was this thought (i was actually thinking about it yesterday in psychology class): ""they say that color is the result of light being absorbed or reflected off of an object. so in order to see color, there has to be light, right? if that is true, then is it true whenever you go into a pitch black room, everything is actually without color?! i know that everything wouldn't be in black and white, but wouldn't everything be in black at least?! everyone would be of the same color in a dark room? it's pretty mind baffling to me. "" also, i've heard that whenever you dream, you don't really dream in color, but your mind and memory make up the colors. they are not true colors. who really knows anyways? the zipper of my dior makeup bag is dipping into the cap of my orange juice bottle that i had this morning. last night was all fun and games until i got home and realized how unsure i am of everything right now, and it's really not a good feeling. i guess i'm just getting used to this whole thing, just transitioning. jess forgot to get milk last night, so i had dry cereal this morning. there is still some left in my bowl right here, i was too busy rushing around, trying to meet scott in time for chemistry.

"the computers at contessa dorms have no modems. i learned that the hard way. so far, here at ut, computers have been quite a pain in the ass. my password for ut access won't work. maybe because its nine letters. i can't tell; the instruction sheet said that you're password should be up to 8 letters, not that it had to be at least eight letters. here in austin should means has to, i guess. sir mix-a-lot is gone, i guess. he did that baby got back song, and then he disappeared, unless you're a hardcore rap fan. i once read about some little down in the midwest where a bunch of rappers lived and made music. like robert earl keen lives in bandera, texas, where i went to summer camp one year. we called ourselves the homies, and had an old cowboy hat called the homie hat. some guy in another tee-pee shot it up at riflery one day, so we had a funeral service, of which i was the preacher. we made am h out of rocks above the hole where we placed the hat and said a prayer. the counselor said it was sacrilegious, but we went through with it anyway, and later dug it up and moved it because we thought some one was going to grave-dig it. that's a great piece of trivia in my life- where ids the homie hat buried? someday, maybe i'll go visit robert earl keen and we'll go up to hamman ranch ymca camp along the banks of the ice-cold medina river and find that h. that would be cool. when i was younger we went to the monahns in west texas, whenever we were visiting my grand-parents in midland. now my mom and grandmother are in a big tiff over a pins shower cap in the upstairs shower. its a silly fight, of course, but i guess its kind of interesting to see who gives in and talks to the other first. my favorite tiff ever was the tongs-becky tiff of late 1995. it involved car accidents, lies, rumors, name-callings. now tongs goes to montana state, in the big sky conference, which brings me back to tiffs. i knew this girl at st. ed's named jenn who had a friend she hadn't seen in a long time who went to southern utah, which i think is in the big sky. so i told her that next time she emails her she should mention that she knew someone in austin who had a friend who was going to another big sky school. i don't think she ever intended to do it, but she emailed her anyway, and this southern utah girl never wrote back. i guess she'll never know about the whole big sky? texas coincidence, unless jenn told her, which i rather improbable. she obviously didn't care. jorge stole todd snider's straw cowboy hat, which is now sitting right in front of me as i write. todd snider, from nashville, was playing at the luckenbach laborfest, where we saw him a year before and when he crowd-surfed, jorge just yanked it off his head. it was badass. jorge says he doesn't feel bad about it. i wonder if todd misses that old hat. i think he does, but he learned a valuable lesson, like when jerry jeff lost his guitar, and found it at some bar in new mexico a year later. that story is probably bullshit, as most of jerry jeff's seem to be. it doesn't matter- i don't pay to hear storied from an era in his life that he probably really doesn't remember, but i do wish he's play a bigger variety of songs- the man has released over 30 albums- all different, yet plays the same set at every concert. i've never even heard pot can't call the kettle black, and that's one of his biggest songs anyway,. you want stories, talk to old sean- his stories pretty much suck, but his pride in telling them is what is so interesting. he makes a walk from georgetown to the jefferson memorial sound fascinating, while i almost get lost lost-to-death in some god-forsaken part of east texas, and i can't even keep people listening.

"it is 11:30 in the morning. i had a nine o'clock class and i should still be asleep. naureen should be home soon, i have to remember to tell her that the bank called. i don't think anyone should call before noon. i need to find something to wear tonight i wander if naureen has anything i could borrow. i can't believe i'm still hungry i have been eating so much. i guess this is how people get their freshman fifteen. i wonder why housekeeping is here on monday. i think that it would be better if they came on monday every week. i don't really like getting up on the days i have a late class. i wish i knew what was wrong with my computer. i also wish i could fix it by myself. i wonder if marty is going to call. i hope he had a good birthday. twentytwo sounds so far away but it seems like yesterday he was eighteen. i need to do other homework so bad and i need to make my bed and clean up the closet. i'm so glad i got a clean room mate. i don't think i could have lived with another slob. i wonder how meagan is doing i should call her and ask if she misses having her own personal maid. 11:40 ten minutes to go. i'm so tired today. if sten and tavis come over tonight i'm never going to sleep. i guess sleep isn't that important. i need to talk to mom i wonder if she is still going to san antonio? i want to see grandma an aunt sylvia but i don't know if i can handle a weekend with mom. i guess i can try to get along with her. i hope we go shopping i really need some winter clothes or i going to shiver my butt off all winter. it is cold in here right now but there is nothing i can do about it. the thing is already turned up as far as it will go i don't think it works. i think they only put the thermostat in each room so you think you have control because it is always cold. if the phone rings one more time i'm going to freak. my phone i so loud you can hear it all the way down the hall. it scares me every time it rings. halloween will be here soon that and new years are the best holidays. i'm going to have to find a costume. ok its been twenty minutes i'm going to sleep this was interesting and i don't feel like i wrote enough but these were my thoughts.

"i'm planning a trip to south padre, and i don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). i guess i always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before i do any physical activity during the day. i think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. i enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. recently, i've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. these sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. it reminds of the goo goo dolls song ""iris"" where the singer writes about ""bleeding just to know your alive. "" the mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. i can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music i'm listening to on the cd player. i think that it's probably still an accurate representation because i don't know if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. speaking of music i'm going to play guitar as much as i possibly can now because i've beaten the video game goldeneye. i'd also like to start writing more. i haven't written in awhile and it's something that i've been missing. the opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which i haven't been taking advantage of lately. i'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. it would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. there are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. in addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. speaking of acts of creation, i would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. i'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. i hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. i took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. the best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. i took a picture at mesa verde of some of the indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. it's an incredible picture. it's a better picture than i thought i'd ever take. i hope i have the gift of capturing beauty on film. it would be a neat talent to have.

"well i just got back from my home town in huntsville today. i went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. i think today was the hardest move i ever made. it as my first trip home since i moved down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. i guess i realized that i don't live there anymore. when i was leaving i thought to myself i have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. i had a blast while i was there. i got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which i was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. i had so much fun with her and with my old friends. i honestly didnt want to come back today. i cried the most i've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. i think she realized that i was actually gone as well. i could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time i have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which i havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know, were ""men"". as i pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other, they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 18 years of living there. i burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when i had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person i saw before i left and i spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. i wish i could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because i wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card and i started to cry again. then i opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and i burst into tears again. i realize how much she really is in love with me and i wish i was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one i visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, i feel a lot better now.

"today if the first sunday that i have been here alone and it is interesting because i don't have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. i can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before i would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and i need to take a shower. i didn't get up till about 11:45. the mtv music video awards and not very exciting and i am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. michael jackson does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they don't seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. i wonder if this is going to get through because i cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class i have ever been in. i hope it is the most interesting. i need to check how much money is in my account. i came with alot and am still wondering how much i will leave with. dana carvey is a funny guy and i figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. i miss running track. i need to go and workout but will when i'm done. hanson is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it i know that i can. i am really infatuated with this girl and hope that i run into her again, actually there are two that i am. eddie murphy is a pimp. i cant believe that princess diana died. i think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. i do not know how long i've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. i feel like beavis and butthead because i am verbalizing all of my thoughts. i stayed up till three o'clock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by aerosmith, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. i still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. i need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because i miss listening to them. i still seems i haven't written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. daisy fuentes is hot and i'm glad that she is not bald. what is marilyn masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and i had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe that's why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. i kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because i have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. i have done absolutely nothing today and i thoroughly like it. i do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. i wonder how many people only take showers every other day. i wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes.

"note: something happened when i was typing this-the words never skipped down to the next line. (maybe it's supposed to be that way?!) anyway, my thoughts continue to the right-quite a ways. sorry for the hassle!! i'm not really sure what this whole assignment is about, but it should be fairly easy for me since i think way too much at times. my thoughts?? i am extremely tired right now. i had a very exhausting weekend and would love to not have classes in the morning. i am doing everything possible to procrastinate and not begin my huge amount of work. i still haven't really gotten in to the whole college thing. i feel like i am in some kind of dream world-like i it's not really me sitting in a college class with 500 other students. maybe i was spoiled in high school with classes of only a max of 25 and a graduating class of only 140. our teachers probably babied us with lots of one-on-one attention-which at the time i loved and appreciated. but now i am so overwhelmed! i'm now only a number out of hundreds of other kids. i guess this whole experience is a big transition no matter what. anyway, i hope i am doing this correctly. i have no idea why my computer is laying out my words like this. i hate computers!! we just don't mix well. i am completely computer illiterate. sorry if this is taking you longer to read. i am very excited about this psychology class. it happens to be one of my possible majors. who knows what will happen?! all i know is that i am a people person and a very good listener that would love to be able to help people in anyway i can. i know it is a tough major with tons of schooling, but it really interests me. i just finished talking to a few of my friends from high school on the phone. they all seem so far away. i miss them and all the fun times we shared. i love reminiscing about our memories, especially looking at old pictures. my walls are full of pictures of friends and family and i'm sure by the end of the year you won't be able to tell what color the walls are. i miss my family too.

" what classes do i take next semester? i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it? is it too much for me? i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what god has in store for me, and what he thinks i should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children i will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that god has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that god has blessed me with several things and i am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, i may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason god has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.

" so i just read the asterix at the bottom of the screen about your social security number and it sounded like the most rediculous thing ever! i mean, obviously you don't want you ssn to be taken, but if youre telling carla you have to speak quietly?! so no one overhears you?! what the hell? i read it out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school, margaret and she said it was probably serious because our freshman english teacher in high school got her social security number stolen. i was sick this morning and i skipped all my classes. i don't know if i should write that because now maybe you think i'm a slacker. but i really felt like complete shit. i did go out last night til like 3, but i'm really snotty and coughing up phlegm. so last night when i got home, i had to walk home early because margaret felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird. so we came back and i was a little drunk and i called my ex from high school, but he's still my best friend and we talk all the time, jacob. it was so funny, he answered the phone- i was really surprised because he sleeps like a log, but he answered and sounded kind of awake so i asked him if i woke him up and he said no he was about to take a nap though. but i'm sure he was woken up. i really like him and i think i'll probably end up with him someday just because i can't picture ever having a friend i can confide in as much as him and i feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem. but i still get elated when he calls me and i love talking to him most of the time. i'm really excited because tonite i'm going to ka pledge line! with one of my friends from high school, daniel, a ka pledge. i can't decide if i should wear this black tube dress with a white ribbon on it or this black mock turtleneck dress thats a little bit longer and supertight. its very flattering, but it seems like guys always like strapless stuff and i have to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and a lot of guys like petite girls. i might go with that one anyway though because i have like a zit on my chest and it shows with the tube one. but i've met jeb bush a few times and i'm way starstruck with him and want to go on a date with him really bad just so i can say i could kind of, and he's kind of short. but i have a crush on this pothead (of course) i'm always attracted to that type (except jacob) who's tall and his name is clayton. i may just forget about jeb and go for the tall shoes. haha. so i've only been writing for 11 minutes 45 seconds! i have so much time left and i already feel like the most shallow girl ever- not to mention slacker for skipping class already. chandler, my suite mate and i are going to go to the ssb later and then-shopping!! you can never be too sick to shop. so right now i'm undeclared liberal arts and i was thinking about transferring to the business school and then i was like what the hell am i doing because i hate math and economics! so i dropped economics and added art history which i do like and decided to just stick with calculus-unfortunately. i got a 75 on my calculus homework yesterday. great a c already, that sucks ass. but i'm taking textiles-which sounds like another crap course but i'm really interested in fashion merchandising as a major. i want to be a buyer when i grow up or own a cute little clothes store. i think that would be a blast. but i told my dad i was taking textiles and he laughed his ass off for like 20 minutes and i mentioned fashion merchandising (but not like i was going to do it) and he would absolutely die and disown me if i majored in that. he was like you can still major in english and be a buyer. but i know he's going to tell the whole family i'm taking textiles and theyre all going to laugh at me and think i'm dumb, but whatever. textiles really is harder than some of my other classes like french (that you would think would be a really hard class). we have to memorize like 500 different kinds of fabrics and their properties. yikes. so i'm like aching right now and i really think i have west nile. chandler's brother's friend (in baton rouge) had to have his appendix out because they thought it was appendicitis, but he really had west nile. how much does that suck?! so i like ut ok right now, but from what i've heard everyone saying about the college experience being the best thing ever, i don't know so much right now. i can't imagine ever having friends as close as the ones i had in high school or meeting people as nice as the ones in baton rouge. louisiana people seem way nicer to me than texas people.

" today is a very stressful day, i just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when i don't understand something perfectly i get really frusterated. my boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. why can't he just let me do what i want? i'm kind of homesick lately. people know all their friends from high school and i'm just alone from wisconsin, besides shane who is not being very nice lately. well actually it's me not being very nice. it's really weird because my friends and i all have birthdays this week. mine's on september 11th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. it never really is. two years ago my party got crashed by richard and then last year it was 9-11. hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 9-11. i think it will. the fact that i have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. oh well i think i've officially decided that i'm changing my birthday to september 12th. my friends and i are all going to hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. i called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought i was going to drop out of school. they wanted to make sure that i had been studying. they don't realize that i am on my own now and that i can deal with my own problems myself. janelle and i just found this new diet. you eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. you have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because i'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. i palyed on a soccer team today. our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. it was a good workout because it was so hot out. it was alot of fun, i scored three goals and i broke darius' toe. oops! i feel kind of bad. i hate the fact that the last 2 weeks all i've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. now i realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. i also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good gpa. i set goqals for myself today because i was reading a book at barnes and noble and i said that i was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. hopefully i can do that. i think i will be able to. i can't believe that shane hasn't called yet. i either thought he'd call at 10am or not at all. oh well there's more out there. i am having a lot of fun here though, so i don't really care if we break up.

" right now i am sitting in my room. my tv ison and i'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. i have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as ut does. right now i'm here in my dorm room, it kind of smells like b. o. , but i think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up the mess that my room-mate and i have made. the tv is on right now and it's kind of distracting but i'm not going to say anythign because i would consider that rude. is it bad that i put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth i really don't care what others think about me. all i care about is what i think of myself, and whether i'm happy with myself or not. at this point i'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. i miss it though. i really don't think that i was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. is it bad that i don't like school?i know that it's only going to benefit my future and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. people don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. it does not cost anything to dream. i'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. i'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. i think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. i set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then i have a total break down. i feel as though i am a failure and i probably will not amount to anything. if you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. i'm sure that by now you can tell that. i'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. i'm very much more comfortable with a 35:1 ratio classes. i'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a b i would say a but that goes back to my really high standards. instead of being dissappointed i would rather achieve something that i know that i can probably complete. i think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. i will always wonder if i was ever able to fufill that a that i wasnt but never really went for. does this make me a bad person? i think not. i'm really considering going to a university back home. i'm here in the college of fine arts in the dance department. what can you really do with a bfa in dance? i'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? there goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. i think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. i'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. i understand that ut isn't a specialized conservatory in the arts, but if you are going to offer a major in dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. i am really considering majoring in psychology with a minor in dance. the university back home, university of the incarnet word, offers a minor in dance and a major in psychology which sounds like the perfect program. i was also thinking about mass media. i was thinking about being a talent agent. i need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. i'm not sure what that is right now.

"i am very frustrated with this computer. i am the most computer illiterate person, and for this day and age, that is no good. i want to check my e-mail but it is telling me my password is incorrect. i am famished right now. i have had this job on my mind all day. i really want to teach dancing but she wants me to teach tap along with ballet, jazz, and cheerleading. i am not the most qualified person to teach tap and i feel i would be doing my students a great injustice be teaching that class. also she has me working on saturdays and if i ever want to go home i will have to find a substitute teacher. this is going to take up a lot of my time and as a freshman i need to make the grades. especially around finals i will need time to study and that is when the studio is going to have a winter show. that means i would have to choreograph six dances and find music. but the thing is i really want to teach dancing like i did back home. this is such a hard decision because i already accepted the job and i feel bad backing out on sherri, the owner. i guess after writing all of this out there are more cons than pros. my friend chad is sitting next to me and he keeps asking me how to spell words. he is interrupting my train of thought. i love typing on computers i just don't know too much about them. i really want to check my e-mail. my dad me something and i would like to read it. i think i'm hungry for chinese food tonight. but chips and hotsauce sound so good. really i think i want italian. i can always eat italian food. i guess it is since i am almost 100% italian. the food a jester is really bad. i have been living off tuna and speghettios that i keep in my room. you know i think i'm going to quit my job that i just got two days ago. i really need to call her right now but i'm at the flawn, so i will do it when i get home. my arm is kind of hurting from typing. maybe i have carpal tunnel syndrome. just kidding. i was looking for the submit button but i'm not sure which one it is. i'll have to ask chad. he is my boyfriend and my best friend. i wasn't sure if i would want a boyfriend my first year of college, but right now i am glad i have him. i think a lot of it is we are more like friends most of the time. or really a lot like brother and sister. but i love him. well i have a lot of other homework and studying i can be doing so this is the end of my thoughts. well those will never end but this is the end of me recording them. bye!

" right now i am doing this psychology ut what will i be doing in the next couple seconds. oop, my roommate just walked in and i have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time. hard! my room mate said hi and i am having trouble responding to him, it looks like stephanie is impressed with my bass. all right you all have a good one. roommate has left, that is weird. i wonder what misung shin yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and stephanie are going to do together, probably nothing much, i can hear my roommate, err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 2005 until the wee hours of the morning which doesn't really bother me but i think it might a little, who knows its probably just something to complain about. i want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with david but i don't have his number so maybe ill call mom and dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me, i got to do the psychology experiment before saturday i don't really understand the experiment system but i think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well i have been going on for a while now and i still have a ways to go, phooey. i like my psych teacher though, he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting. oh man i think i accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well i'll just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good, and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology i was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if i could ever be a professor who really really knew his stuff. do i work hard enough? i think i do, i been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but i've been working too. another thing that i can't escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind, yet maybe i think about it more than others. i think about whether or not i'm too picky. i haven't ever gone with a girl for longer than like 2 months i really can't stand the thought of a girlfriend, i haven't really met a girl that i'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks i've already had some opportunities but i just straight decided i didn't' want to go with them why? you know it has to do with looks i probably seem really shallow but i just want a chick who looks damn good not just good if i find myself thinking of reasons why i don't like you the fact of the matter is i'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late i've ditched some really cool people and i feel bad about it but then i've been ditched too sometimes i think i have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you don't want to be somebody's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so i need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date, don't worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that's what i say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things don't just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people i think i will ask kim and liz if they want to go out sometime now there's two people that look like they got their shit together liz dropped out of sfa last year so what? she has her priorities straight you know everybody has their faults i don't want to be recognized for getting a's in class that's crap i want people to say yeah that guys is a friggin funny cool guy i like being around him, but i only want people that i can get along with to say that how do you tell the ones that like you but you don't like them gto go away it seems harsh you don't want to be an ass and the fact of the matter is you may need them some day but for what??? as long as you've got your friends you are unstoppable you are having fun you are just with your buddies and you wouldn't have it any other way like my family man i just realized how much i love them by being away from them for such an extended period of time i really missed them i didn't think that would happen but it did my sister my dad my mom are really important to me and i love them to death bottom line man i'm hungry after this i'm going to see if i can get a hold of david and singer and maybe well go get something to eat i got to talk to david man that guy is really cool maybe i have the number in my desk somewhere i don't know but maybe ill just be lazy and go out by myself, maybe just maybe ill go out an meet somebody that will play an important role in my life maybe ill have one of the best times of my freshman year who knows what could happen in the 20 minutes after i finish this project who knows? god knows? don't get me started i could write all the proofs that straight out blast christianity to the nether regions but no i believe in that little piece of spirituality that's in us all call it god jesus whatever its there but it is just there its our spirituality it is us so thanks for reading and ill talk to you later boi.

" oh boy, the first writing assignment. i hope i am doing this correctly. i can't really think of anything else right now. i sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. i am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can i say. i am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. i don't know what i feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so i guess its a little warm in here. i can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. i guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 20 min of writing sure will suck. well, i still don't know what to think. i'm still bored. i'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company i enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and i occasionally see her on the weekends, although i've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now i'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. i'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but i think i had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when i when i bought it using his credit card account. i guess i thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but i ignored his call because i am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, i like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy i know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although i'm a passivist, i hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. i thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, i think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. i wonder how they're doing. its been a while since i last talked to almost any of them, and i just wonder how they're doing. maybe i should go up there sometime. although i have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. i'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now i'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. i think his parents weren't too happy about it, because i've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but i ignored his call as well. now i'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy i've know for almost 18 or 19 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. i'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase i know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although i'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, i know he'll be happy, and for that reason, i too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, i hope that this will end soon. and now i see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and i, which i don't thin she should do. i think i'll stop her when i'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till i'm done. yippie.

"although, i constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, i failed to do so. recently, i have noticed a drastic change in my life. prior to the major transition of my life (college), i used to constantly worry. worry. worry. although i still worry, i have learned to view life from another perspective. each and every minute i must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. i realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. for instance, i was watching a movie last night (something i rarely do because i feel i am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. very few movies make me think long after i finished watching the movie, but this one did. the overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. all in all, i am trying to stress that i am still learning regardless of what i do. this certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. today, i have several things to do. my priority list is very long, but i am limited with time. it seems the more i think about how much i have to do, the less time i have to do it. i have two tests next week. chemistry and calculus, respectively. my weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. austin, or rather ut, is a very convenient campus. opposed to my hometown, ut allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. this form of transportation is very tempting! i just bought a laptop which i am very excited about. i felt rushed when i bought it, but it is too late now. i still have to buy a pc card for it so i can access the internet from my dorm. i want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but i have so many things on my mind. by the time i get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!! my life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. but, i enjoy it! i am confused on what organizations i should join here at ut. i am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything i am offered. here at ut, i am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything i want to join. i hope that i will gradually reach the peak i was at in high school. i am sure i will. i was unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. i believe i have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.

"wow! i'm not much on typing for 20 minutes, but i love to write emails to my friends. so i guess that that counts. i miss them so much, they are my friends from camp. i get to see them this weekend, and i cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, i guess that i just need to say something to her, cause i'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, i know that she doesn't. i hope that i can fit everything into my schedule that i need to, cause i have a lot on my ""to do list"". haha, i'll try! that's all i can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that i thought would be less than it is. i mean, i thought that i was pretty responsible, but i'm guessing that now i'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, i'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. i miss them. but that's ok, cause i have so many new friends down here that i don't know what to think. i've had some dates, but nothing great and way exciting so far. i guess that i'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe god will just bless me w' some amazing guy while i'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause i have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 5 people just walked in my door. i need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, i do. i wish that i could control how much i eat, well, i guess that if i keep on telling myself that, then i need to take some action. well, self, listen. i hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. i need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. i really like my room, i think that it reflects my personality. i change my thoughts a lot. i expected that when i would write this, that i might just write about one thing, but i keep thinking about a lot of things. i guess that i didn't think about it too much, cause i get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but i like her. haha, weird for a girl, but i love to dance and sing. i think that she's talented. i hope that i don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause i haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates. i love to talk to people, they make me happy. well, yea, i really like to talk to people and get to know them. its so much fun. i feel that i'm rambling about absolutely nothing. i wish that i could see the stars here in austin. but i love when i get to get away cause that's one of my favorite things to do. maybe i'll get a chance to this weekend when i go to a&m. i love how people tell me that they are praying for me. cause i know that pray works. god is the deal! yea pray makes me happy too. being happy can keep anyone going in life. different things make different people happy. i like to find that out about people. god fills me w' my joy! i really like typing this cause it makes me think about what i am really about. i feel guilty when i make some smart remarks and then i cussed today. which, i never do. that just makes me feel like a piece of junk. ok, i have to go, byebye. :) ",1,1.148331 0.730298 -0.01505 0.679879 1.986872 -0.65937 -0.672002 -1.278056 -0.837279 0.106298 -0.201992 -0.590446 -0.960578 0.397886 -1.351793 0.0 -0.04277 1.642141 2.040484 -0.565251 2.000652 -0.294936 0.162104 -0.369562 3.006994 -1.878748 -1.046714 -0.535463 0.592452 2.096564 3.310634 0.226036 -1.405384 -0.906028 -1.017959 -0.384339 0.869067 0.961179 0.221812 0.631875 2.802411 0.363995 0.060518 0.26613 -0.809347 1.016038 -0.20959 0.200658 0.879033 -0.176865 1.08229 -0.575875 -1.425871 1.129338 -0.881575 -1.119303 -0.562669 -0.340848 -0.878383 2.556635 -0.049049 -0.435923 2.558177 1.229679 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.415231 1.211194 0.067014 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.35108 -0.337085 0.250698 0.386894 -0.451544 0.630458 0.951886 5.877111 3.587273 5.28991 5.146359 4.772928,1253
" i enjoy doing writing assignments liek these. you get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind. the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really don't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart. i wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be. whether i will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class. but among those thought, i also wounder how this semester is going to go. i hope that i am going to be able to do well enough to bring my gpa up so that i am able to get more scholarships fo next year. man, when i notice what i am thinking about, i notice that i really think about things that may affect me in certain ways. like doing homework for my classes or whether or not i'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills. but as i take the time to think, i feel that i will be forced to get another job so that i will be able to afford all this new responseablity that i have taken on. its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time. but right now its hard for me to do anything when all i'm thinking about it how bad i feel right now. right now i have a stuffed and runny nose, and i am also sore from working out on wensday. it hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy. i think i worked myself out a little too much, i feel that i tried to push myself a little more then i should have since it was my first day working out since last semester. i think i screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break. all i did was work to pay off some of my bills that i acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons. its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and son't pay attention to the time, time really seems to fly by. take this assignment for example. i started to write what i was thinking and now that i look at how long i've been writing, i've noticed that i have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it. it merely seems like i've been writing for about 5 minutes. if all the assignments were like this one, i bet pretty much every one would do good, cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time. you can just about write about anything you want, whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest, all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too.

"i wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting? i am getting a little hungry. kym's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. i think i should turn if off in a second. it smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. i miss my cousin tabby so much being three hours away is too far. i wonder what my brother is doing right now. he probably has football practice. i hope we win the football game this weekend. that reminds me, last weekend was so crazy i don't think i am ever going to drive someone else's car again. gee that was an adventure though. i think i should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. why does my phone light keep turning off and on? i really need to get a new one already. i hope my friend likes the birthday present i bought him. everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! that new cd that i bought is great i actually feel like listening to it right now. oh great i have calculus homework. that stuff is so confusing. it was just yesterday when i was talking to joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at tech. he said, i wonder what i got myself into. "" and i began wondering that myself. okay what was that cow noise that i just heard from my sisters computer? that thing is always making the weirdest sounds. my sister is so smart; i wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. but what do i know i'm just the middle child. my brother and sister are always saying i have ""middle child syndrome,"" but what is that anyway. i wonder if my dad is out of work already. he always has a busy work load. man i never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. i mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. wow my dad is really smart too. and what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. i wish tabby would come and visit us. i think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. i am really attached to her. i mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now i barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. i wonder how danielle is doing at duke. i bet she is having a ball. that is her dream college and i can't wait to hear the stories at christmas. i wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. mmm i can almost smell it all the way over here. i am still hungry maybe i should go downstairs to get something to eat.

"i've been thinking and this ""freshman fifteen"" thing has to be an urban legend. i mean, really, i've never walked so much in my entire life. everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so i figure, if i walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. then i run errands and visit my friends and before i know it i've had an entire week's workout. and then when i have extra time i go to the gym and i know i'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. for instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. so i know i'm not the only one who walks, like 20 miles a day and still goes to the gym. but let's suppose i rode the campus loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would i gain weight? no because the jester cafeteria is not somewhere i go for seconds. of course the food isn't the worst i've ever eaten, but i'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. and on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. there is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. it's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. cheese pizza: 19 grams of fat; hamburger topping: 6 grams of fat. how can you ignore that? but i guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something i want to avoid. i am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 20 miles a day, and still go to them gym because gosh darn it! i will not gain the freshman fifteen. i will not. i won't let it happen. i will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. i can't do it. i won't do it. i will not gain the freshman fifteen. besides, it's just an urban legend anyway.

"i am so stressed out right now i don't even know what to do. if it's not one thing it's another. everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. i'm trapped. i have so much inside that i want to let out, and sometimes i don't know what to do with myself. there are just too many pressures. sometimes i wish i could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. but it wouldn't be. sadly, i'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who i really want to be. i wish i could just be mary all of the time. but, it's impossible. i'm always too worried about everything, but i think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. i always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. i also find it hard to express those perspectives. most people just don't care, but i seem to fret over everything. maybe i'm obsessive, i don't know! but to top it off, i'm pretty happy where i am today. i guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where i am today. i can't believe how some people really are. some people i know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. they let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. i don't want to waste my lifetime like that. while i'm still young i want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that i have. i would love to contribute to the world and be the best person i can possibly be. i don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. i know the truth, and no one can judge me accept god. i want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. but the world is not that nice. it is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes i wish i didn't live in it. but the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. there's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. sometimes i'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that i want to do. a friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. i like that advice. there's so much inside of me that i want to explode! and i wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. well, i certainly hope not. i want to be 85 and feel like i'm still 15. a lot of times i wish i were 3 or 4 again with no worries or responsibilities. i believe being around that age was the best time of my life. i had no real care in the world. i was too confused to. i had no idea i actually existed in the outside worldi just was. well, i could go on forever but i got things to do. i kind of like this assignment. it's neat. well, i don't want to bore you or anything, and i think my 20 minutes is up! so, it was nice chatting with you dr. p!

"how should i start this? writing about my thoughts and feelings is kind of difficult when asked to put them down into words. i mean, i think about things all the time especially when i am walking to class or trying to go to sleep. right now i am at my friend desiree's house and i am doing this assignment because i have not done any homework tonight, and i feel like i need to do something before i go to sleep. desiree is so great! she is my best friend up here in austin. when i think about how we met(we met in chicago at a youth leadership forum the summer after our junior year of high school) and that we both came to u. t. , it astonishes me how fate works. i am a firm believer in fate. my mom always worries about me getting killed in a car accident or getting attacked or something, but i always tell her that a meteor could come through my ceiling at ten o'clock at night and kill me if god wants me dead. there is no stopping fate. but then again, maybe i put too much trust into fate. i always think that things happen for a reason and that if something is meant to be, it will happen. i think that is a good thing to believe. it gives you a positive outlook on life. when something bad happens, i always remind myself that it happened for a reason. this sort of thinking really helps me get over stuff. i bet that everyone who does this assignment ends up talking about love. i think that love and relationships are always on people's minds. i know that i think about it often. wondering what my future husband is doing right now at this very minute or thinking about some guy that i like. i don't have a boyfriend in austin right now, but in some ways i'm glad that i don't. i find that when i like a guy i end up thinking about him in class instead of paying attention to the class. that can really get me into trouble. who knows? i really need to do well this semester. i am shooting for a 4. 0! i think that getting a 4. 0 would be awesome, and i am going to do it! i want to do it at least once before i graduate from college. that is one of my goals. that may sound kind of sad, but i really want to just to show everyone that i am here and i got a 4. 0. even if it is only once, i want to do it. well, my twenty minutes is up and i really need to get some sleep so i can work on getting that 4. 0 gpa. it was nice talking to ya whoever you are.

"i just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where i live. i just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an ethernet. my boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. he goes to baylor. he hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. i am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, i can be really anal at times. i am sorry if this looks messed up, but i couldn't figure out how this works. sorry again. i sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an ""f"". i really miss my boyfriend. i am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. i don't know if i am in good enough shape to make the team. i haven't danced in like four months, and i am really out of shape. i am adjusting pretty good i guess to the whole college experience. i have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and i are going shopping at the mall at 4 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. i am misspelling words right and left huh. i am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, i hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting i have no more classes today, but i need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. my boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. i think he had a good time. we went out to eat at el arroyos, which was rumored to have good tex-mex food. they were right, alright. some of the best i've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. he stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on saturday. he came over to srd and we went shopping on the drag. i got two t-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, i think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because i'm here. i don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but i hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to baylor's. we then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. he needs 24 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 26, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. amy just walked in and said hi!. now she looked at my screen i'm not crazy, i am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me. i needed to get this done today because i have plans for the rest of the week after wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. i should've recorded what time i started typing, huh! that would have been beneficial. i'm retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes i have no common sense. i wonder what my grades will be like this semester. i am used to straight a's, and i hope i can accomplish this in college as well. i need to petition my ap grades sometime soon, but i don't know when or where. oh, well, i'll look it up somewhere, and get it done. i need to do some laundry today, too. i am running out of plain little t-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe i'll find something cute while i'm shopping today. i hoe my boyfriend ( jaron is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think i am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what i am engraving into it. so he'll remember. i am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. i need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz i am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know i live at 27th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. i think i have been typing for twenty minutes so i am going to submit this. i wonder what happens if i didn't type for twenty minutes. what if i don't get credit. maybe i'll keep going for another minute. i checked my mailbox when i came in, and i didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. i think i am running out of things to say, so i'll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line.

"i was just typing for like 3 minutes and all the stuff i just typed erased. so now i'm really pissed off. i was writing about my boyfriend and how i miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. i am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. i am so excited. i really don't like it up here i just have to deal with it and get used to it. i get so happy when i get to go home on the weekends. so you could say i am living for the weekends. that is bad i guess but i don't know, i just have to get used to it. i am talking to my friend right now. she is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. i wish she would just be herself all the time. i wish that some of my friends would come up here. i am ready to go home. i miss my family and especially my mother. she would comfort me right now. i need to read my bible. i am so bored right now. and i'm tired because i stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. i wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. i am so bored. my friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. i hate when she lies. she does that all the time. i wish she wouldn't do that. i wish my friend kim would come up here and go to college with me. i have already made up my mind that if i don't like it by the end of the semester i am going to transfer. i will try to stick it out though. i have calculus homework due thursday and i am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems i don't know how to do. my calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. that is horrible. i can't wait till i get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and i will be able to understand stuff better. dang! i didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. i have like nine more minutes. i am so bored. as soon as i finish this i am going to sleep. no! after i talk to my boyfriend. he is coming up here on the 19th and i can't wait. i haven't seen him in a while. i wonder what he is doing right now. my daddy gets on my nerves. he always has something smart to say. he can't never just let stuff be. i wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. i am really glad i have church members that care about me. i have received so many phone calls. it really encourages me to know that i have people praying for me. i have to keep reminding myself that i want to be a pharmacist and that i have to do what i have to do to get it. i am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and i will do good and that i won't fail any classes. i want to talk to my boyfriend now, but i am not going to call him until i finish this. twenty minutes is long, and i didn't know it could be so long. i guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because if i didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. i really miss my mother. i'm about to read my bible, so i can gain some encouragement. i think i may call my mother before i go to bed or not. i need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that i am and accept my responsibility. i am about to call my boyfriend. i love him and hope we get married right after i finish school, if we last that long. if not, i wish the best for him in life. but i think we would be good together. we are good together now. except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. i can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. and my family. i'm ready to see everyone. i love being at home. i wish when i was in high school i didn't always want to leave home ",1,0.068484 0.441675 1.171957 0.526474 0.691358 0.805731 -1.469137 -0.850062 -1.471168 0.575842 -0.194694 -0.590446 -1.787622 1.864933 -1.348139 0.0 -0.04277 1.736587 1.743189 0.769455 2.046408 -0.362268 0.649358 -0.799137 -0.183391 -1.726638 -0.21325 -0.506743 -0.098151 0.064705 0.917435 0.821243 -0.195592 -0.906028 -0.090659 0.122448 0.354523 -0.317861 -0.923897 1.191348 1.292061 -0.423699 -0.459945 0.264531 -0.112388 1.717815 -1.093488 0.940165 1.530518 0.561495 -0.934248 1.785025 -1.024676 1.857145 1.25611 0.002214 0.970713 0.087938 0.435962 -0.795232 0.558809 -0.61112 0.99476 -0.074126 -0.213097 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.418632 -1.009742 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.064912 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.069332 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.471022 5.435927 4.060626 5.065266 5.222742 3.81572,1997
"i don't know what to do with my boyfriend. i am so distracted by him and i should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in college. i don't really feel that great today. i really feel like taking a bath. it would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. i wonder eho the package is from that i got. it is really stupid that i won't be able to pick it up until tuesday. my room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. i miss my roommate already. maybe i should have gone home this weekend. oh, well i guess my weekend is going ok because i got to see both jared and eddie yesterday and that made me happy. i miss jared right now. i wish my siter was here. we would have so much fun. i heard that she already took over my room. i don't really know what i think about that. i don't know how i am going to get all my work done, i can't believe i slacked off sp much and i would have had all my stuff done already. oh well, i guess next time i will do better. i hope that i will be able to get my application to the texas spirits this week so i can start meeting people. maybe i should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. hopefully with the things i am attempting to join i will be able to meet some more peope. it is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. all my frinds from high school were pretty much people that i had been friends with since catholic grade school. making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many difference places. ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere i have been before. except for new york city, i guess. but i guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and i guess that is prety hard to comprehend. i wonder ho jennifer is at lsu. the last time i talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. i hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. so far, it seems like kristen and colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. i haven't talked to sarah at all , i hope she is doing ok. i wonder if she has met wes yet , i bet they would get along really well. this wirting is completely all over the place. i am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so i guess i can end my rambling.

" well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that i have ever done, i can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 20 minutes, wait 28 minutes and 30 seconds. that was some math i was hoping to avoid. i wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact i shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, yes! oh wait no thats not right there is still that whole writing thing i'm doing. come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. for better or for worse. at least the week has begun. in high school thats the last thing i would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how i feel now. upon self reflection though i realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that i had to work all weekend. oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. looking around the room i see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. the last one that i got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in ireland did they say they were from? can't remember. anyway the poster was one i had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. it's a nice photograph of an h bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. good. even though this is a course assignment i feel very idle, a feeling that i don't particularly like. don't get me wrong i like not having anything to do but i have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. i wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). well of course it wouldn't, but i am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. the abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking i need to finish that first chapter). it was something that i had never given much thought to other then what i saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. i had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now i have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (i wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? if there wasnt there should be. except maybe with they dozens of typos i am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. continue writing? i don't think so.

"i'm in my roomate's room right now, since my computer is not hooked up to the internet yet. i never realized how little she does. she has a piece of paper, apparently meant to be a homework assignment, but it's covered with the most random, 1st grade-type drawings i've ever seen. she obviously put a lot of effort into this. i guess she was trying to avoid doing her assignment. this room is a mess. i can't wait until my computer's working. i haven't checked my e-mail in a while. i guess i should do that, seeing as how i'm expecting scholarship information. i really need some more money, preferably free money. it'd be nice to not have to work for once in my life. not like my parents help me. thye have better things to spend it on, like my spoiled-rotten older sister who can't fend for herself because she's never had to. i wish i could call mom evry month and tell her how much money i'll be needing this month to survive. it's pretty ridiculoous when you have to give plasma for food. i need to just file for independence, i basically support myself anyways. i'm actually thinking about getting my wisdom teeth pulled at one of those labs that tests anesthetics on you. i'm supposed to pay for it myself, but how the hell am i going to afford that? rent's coming up and i haven't even received all my financial aid money yet. oh, well. maybe i can somehow either win the lotto or get discovered. i'm going to a modeling contest in a week. hopefully thing will go well there. i really need to get out of texas. my boyfriend brad lives 3 hours away in west texas. he's supposed to start playing college football again in the spring. there's going to be draft people there form the nfl. that'd be pretty cool too, except that if he moved to a different state, he'd want me to go with him. i'm not sure i want to succeed in getting out of here through him. stephanie, my roommate, has some of my stuff in here. that kind of pisses me off. i don't take her shit. my other roommate yoshi owes me $50 dollars. i need it for my psychology book (ironic, isn't it?). i found out yesterday that he owes all his friends money, almost $1000 total. i don't think i'm going to be seeing that money anytime soon. i don't get payed for another week, and my job pays crap. i want to get a new job, one that actually pays me decently, but unfortunately, i love my shitty job. i graduate in 1 1'2 years if things go right. that is, if i can get into the psychology dept. (once again, ironic). why is psychology the only major in lberal arts that i actually have to apply for? i could've have gotten in easily when i first applied for school if i had known what i wanted to do. oh, well, not much i can do about it now. i've missed way too many classes already, and it's only the 3rd week. i've never been sick in my life, and now my immune system decides to go on a vacation. i wonder if my parents realize that i'm probably never going to talk to them again after i graduate? i know if i mean that or not. sometomes i think i do. i don't think soomeone going to school full-time should ever be burdened as much as i am by financial responsibilities. it's jsut not right when, according to everything i've applied for, they make too much money.

"here i go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the texas hill conutry. useraly the frist thing i notce are the ceder trees, and while i like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. this is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.

"i think i'm trying to hard to write what i'm thinking which defeats the entire purpose of this paper, you aren't supposed to think about what you write, you're supposed to write what you think about. wow, i was impressed with that little quote there. i cannot live without you. "" i've had that song stuck in my head all day long. it's a good song but i only know that much of it. i wish i could actually sing the rest of the words to that song instead of mumbling through them. i have a problem with singing lyrics. why am i reading over what i have just wrote? i guess it's just a habit that i've gotten into after writing so many essays in my life. i usually despise essays. i love writing, just not essays. hmmm. was that a pretty girl that just walked by? i just caught her foot as she passed my door. i think it was a pretty foot. i need to find a girlfriend. girlfriends are great. well, they can be. depending on who it is. i loved my last girlfriend to death. i miss her so much. i hate not being able to see her any more. curse age! of course i do not wish i was 2 years younger but i do wish that she was 2 years older. why did i bother to redo that sentence? i actually wrote 2 sentences and then combined them to make one. am i following all of the rules to the ""stream of consciousness"" writing assignment? i wonder if you can determine if a person has add by reading a ""stream of consciousness"" paper. hell, by the time you get done with mine, you will probably think i am. hell, hell, hell, hell, that word just stuck in my head for some reason. i wonder if that means that i'm satanic. ""thegreatjakobie"" just signed onto aol instant messenger. ""i can't talk buddy! i'm writing what i think!"" metacognition. thinking about thinking. that is such a cool concept. i often think about metacognition so i guess i can say that i often think about thinking about thinking. that actually makes sense. ""i cannot live without you!. all that kjsoifl me, alkjsoithaj me, i cannot live without you!"" damn words. i should probably learn them. i often spell a word that i know how to spell but it doesn't look right when i write it so i spend like 5 minutes trying to determine if it's spelled right. i'm thinking about that damn song again. my elbow hurts. it pops a lot. i wonder if that means it's going to fall off one day. i don't think it's healthy. i don't know anybody else who's elbow hurts and pops on a regular basis. ""strike 3! you're out!"" i hate baseball, but it popped into my head when i spelled basis. bases. stases! rhetoric and comp class sucks. it's not my cup of tea. have you ever been in one of those really big tea cups that spin around really fast at carnivals? they suck too. when i get done i feel like i'm going to vomit all over my shoes. vomit stinks a bunch. my friend paxton doesn't like vomit either. he says that when he smells vomit, it makes him want to vomit too. and all the people around him will see all this vomit and pretty soon, the whole room is blowing chunks all over each other. chain vomiting. comforting. i'd like to stop thinking about vomiting now. ""i cannot live without you!"" latin drums can seriously rock! especially in that damn song that i have had stuck in my damn head all day. my face itches. i hate when things itch. that would be a feeling that i would rather not have. if i had a choice of course. only 2 minutes left! that sucks! i'm kind of getting into this whole writing thing! we should do this assignment every week! that would rock. oooooooowwwwwwwww! damnit! i was stretching and when my arms came back down i hit my already broken ass elbow on my chair. that sucked! oh man, that really depressed me. that hurt a whole bunch. ahhhh! 30 more seconds! lets see how many letters i can hit! kasdfkjhasdkfjhaksdjhfkljasdhfkljadshfkljadshfkljahdsfkljhasdklfjhaklsdjhklahciluhekjhsdfkljahdsfkljhasfdkljhicukljaeno;iawejoijackjnowedjoaur9238u4r928jofjieodfija9we8urfojkljsdcvliuadshfckjenrflkh9pc8usdcioajerfkjriofjup98ufoasdfjkjnckdsjcpoaiufpo0wuero9qu8w3roiqwjrefknsdovjoaisdujva98weuf9wuefroawkejrflkijsdfolaijsdfoiaujfoikw4ejfoijasdoifjasldkfjao;sdifuj0waoejflknvoijc0932i1-09i-1i-0 ha! that's how many letters i can type in 30 seconds. well, technically, it was less than that because i was finishing that last sentence up. well, my 20 seconds are up. good luck on trying to pull meaning from this madness.

"i'm sitting here typing again i've got a lot to do today i want to get all of my work done soon so i don't have to worry about anything this weekend but i probably will anyway cause i always do. i wish i was a speed reader like on this movie i once saw -my stepmother's an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if i could do that i would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . i'm sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe i should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that i have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now i feel it may have been a mistake i'll feel better tomorrow. after i sleep it will be nice to see paul tomorrow. justin is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- i wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- i wont be one of them though i will stand alone. mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but i think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so i cant see his 'cycle' but still i think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when i was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we aren't really all alone were all created from the same stuff. i probably sound like a televangelist but i shouldn't care what you think of me anyway. i wish i could just cuddle up with justin under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep i love waking up next to him so warm - it doesn't even matter if we get married - i've thought about it sometimes. its what's now that's important and i love him and we're happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now.

"hmm. writing assignment in psychology class. and here i was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing, excluding any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes. man i am making so many mistakes as i type, i couldn't possibly be nervous i know that for sure. oh look, what do you know, only about 1 minute and 30 seconds have gone by; i really don't know if i can keep this up for another 18 minutes or so. i wonder if grammar actually counts, not like i would receive any points on it if i wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway. hmm. think i will go back and read this message before i continue any longer. but, i guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner. stream of consciousness, that term reminds me of my humanities class in 9th and 10th grade. it definitely reminds of james joyce, the author of ulysses who attempted to write an entire book based on the method of stream of consciousness. man that was quite painful to read, since he didn't use any sort of punctuations at all. maybe i'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either. i wonder if i'm destroying the purpose of this experiment. writing this makes me wonder, can this really be stream of consciousness? there had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another. i'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well. heck, whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class. dr. pennebaker is one hilarious person, good at making fun of people. there is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates. it is always a good laugh. well, friday's almost here, that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by. at least i get to go home for this weekend, i'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting american food at the jester buffet or city limits. i'm actually going home for business training. since i am an independent business owner, i should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that i have. speaking of assets, i just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability. robert kiyosaki is a very, very intelligent man. i guess why he's the multi-millioinaire and i'm not. oh well, maybe i'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend. weird, what was i thinking. i could've sworn i was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier. i guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh. man, it seems like it's been forever, but only 10 minutes has gone by. speaking of time, it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time. some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock. personally, i think the clock goes by so much quicker if i'm not constantly staring at it all the time. i wonder how many spelling mistakes i've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. back to the business training, i hope the ninety dollars were well spent. i really hope that bww has put together somethin good this year, something that all the bww'quixtar-affiliated independent business owner can benefit from. man that was a pain to type, i probably should've just typed bww'quixtar ibo's for that matter. anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that i'm participating in, well actually, owning. i don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes i really wonder why that is. the only thing i'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so i'll have multi-million dollar returns. and then i think i'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity i was involved in. even better, the stupid electrical engineers that i call friends can work for me in the future. just as robert kiyosaki says, an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them. i will be able to prove myself one day. being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. besides daisy of course, she is the love of my life. without her, i don't think i would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. i'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that i possibly can. looks like i better get rich quick. but, i doubt she's interested in me being rich, i truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. she's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something i really respect. she always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. i'm so lucky that i've found her, and i'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. i cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. all i can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. i thank god everyday for all the things he has bestowed upon me. of course, besides eternal life, daisy is the next greatest gift that i have ever received. oh look, time's up, bye!

"well, i figured i should write this right now while i have time. i am really busy lately. it kind of seems like i have no time for myself anymore. i am trying out for crew. there are a lot of people trying out though. i think like 130 people are going for 32 spots. i hope i make it though because i don't deal well with failure. i tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because i did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. so now everyone probably thinks i just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. i was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. oh well. i guess it taught me how to cope with failure. but it really hurts every time i fail. i tried to get into the business school and was denied. that got me so mad. there are all of these total morons in the business school. i know because i take classes with them and always make better grades than them. but alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. oh well. i am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that i did not get in. but i think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. i am trying to be really involved this year. i am lifeguarding for the rec center. it is kind of fun, but i kind of dread going to work all the time. i just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. i had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. i am not sure if it was his fault or if i caused it because of all the stress i am under. oh well. i think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. she seems to be really distant. i am not sure what is wrong with her. maybe it is my fault. i am not around as much as i used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. she also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. i just feel like things have totally changed. she went to a party last night and didn't invite me. weird. i think i am really different from most people. i always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. i just don't understand why people don't do that. or maybe i don't understand why i do that. like, i would invite everyone to come with me if i was doing something cool. but all the people around me just i think are selfish. maybe i just need to find a whole new group of friends. i mean, i had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. and when i see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how i did. he totally forgot about it. that gets me so mad. he seems to forget about everything. he then says how he is a bad boyfriend. unfortunately, i have to agree with him. but don't get the wrong impression of me. i am actually a very happy person. i am just going through a lull right now. once i get into a normal routine in my life i think i will be a lot happier. i just wish that my family was here. my parents live in virginia, and it is hard with them so far away. at least my brother is here with me. that makes it a lot easier. i don't know what i would do if he wasn't here. i never realized how dependent i was on other people. i always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but i guess i really am not. i like being around people, and maybe i do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. i think i really need to work on the jealousy thing. that is probably why i am having problems with my boyfriend. he finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. i think i also don't really trust him. i don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. he was asking me the other day why i back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. i just don't like talking about it. i consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. it is nobody else's business. but i guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. sex is on everyone's mind. but it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. i would much rather just cuddle that have sex. maybe i am weird, i don't know. but that drives my boyfriend crazy. he want's to have sex all the time. i think that is a major problem in our relationship. oh well. well, i guess my time is about up. i now have to go to crew again. i should do good today because it is strength training. i am pretty confident about that. well, i guess i only have one more of these to write. that relieves some of my stress. actually this was pretty cool doing this. i could just write down what i have been keeping inside. pretty neat.

"i don't have too much on my mind right now, and if im worrying about anything, it may be about classes. this class in particular is not too troublesome, but this is my first year in college, and im noticing that the style of school is in many ways different. and its not that i don't think i will be able to adapt, but i am a little intimidated. the laid-back style of college allows for a lot of distractions and freedom. so i believe that if i set a pattern now to get everything that i need done, i will be much better off. not only, are the classes here different, but my whole social life has been turned upside down. i don't know whether i should let go of most of my old acquaintences from high school, and dive right into new friendships. or to hang on to the people who i feel know me the best. i loved my high school years. i loved the people i grew close to, i loved the environment, i loved the things i was involved in. and now, i don't have any of those things to comfort me. i loved theatre, i remember all the plays i was in and all the fun times and great bonds i made with people. including the director. he was like my second father, someone i could really talk to, but also someone who taught me a lot about myself. and the things he taught me really can't be put into words, but rather they can be applied to my life right now. i feel so much more grown up after growing close to him in 4 years and feel like if he believes in me, there is no reason for me not to. that may be my one biggest flaw. at times i have somewhat low self-esteem. well, to refine that statement, i doubt myself and my worth at times. never at a dangerous level, im not anywhere near depressed, but i do tend to put others before myself. i care so much about people in my life, and i expect the same from others. but that isnt the way it is most of the time. i put my heart out there, and often it gets passed over. and on that subject, that is the main reason why i broke things off with my high school boyfriend. there were other contributing factors, but this past summer, i finally put myself before him and realized that i wasnt getting what i wanted out of the 8 month old relationship. i loved him so much, and deep down, i know he loved me, and still does. but he didnt try hard enough. and he says now he realizes that he didnt treat me as good as he should have, and i knew that he would eventually see that, that is why i broke it off--to make it obvious something was wrong. and it took him a long time to see that. we were best friends, and maybe that is why it took me so long to say something. because i had so much faith in someone so close to me, i was sure i was exaggerating things, being selfish. but after enough people telling you that you deserve better, it really starts to make you think. i would always be the one putting forth the effort, i would always aplologize, i would always go out of my way for him, i would compliment him, etc. and ultimately, he wanted an easy relationship. he didnt want to have to make me feel special, even if he felt it deep down. and now he tells me this. and its very unlike him to see that he was insensitive for so long. he usually doesnt see things like that clearly. but maybe losing a girlfriend and best friend made him see things differently. i miss him though. i was the one who made this decision, i should be strong and not rely on him. but i miss him and talking on the computer to him everyday while he's at a&m lets me see the guy that i fell in love with. . especially because he is so nice to me lately. he claims that he's going to wait around for me, and that we will end up together again someday, but im not as sure as he is. i mean, i would love to be his girlfriend if he could treat me better. but we are so far apart, it seems silly of gaining a title of being a girlfriend, but being just as lonely. i need to be on my own for this new experience i am going through, and not attatched to his arm. i need to see who else is out there, this is college for goodness sake. but no matter who i meet, i will always compare them to him. i never thought of it that way, but he was my first love. its weird to imagine that i really was in love, i never thought it could happen. but its very obvious that it was love. but for now i have to be strong, and just keep on the way things are. no matter how much i miss him. because i don't want to get hurt again, not yet, not this far away. im afraid things will just go back to the way they were, and i'll be 10 times more lonely. and its hard enough to meet friends here, there are so many people- i don't need to make it harder by being cooped up in my room all day talking to my boyfriend miles away. this school is funny like that. there are almost too many people to make friends. everyone is doing their own thing, and its really easy to get sucked into hanging out with your old high school friends and not make new friends. but thats not what i came here for. i came here to meet new people, new open minded people, and have new experiences. and to redefine who i am as a person and a friend. but that doesnt mean i have to cut old ties alltogether. hmm. i wonder if its been 20 minutes yet. i think so.

"as i am told to write this assignment, i begin my forced thinking by trying to find the correct ideas to write in this paper, instead of thinking whatever i want to in an incomplete and disordered way as i have been used to since i got out of school three months ago. so it's very difficult right nom, and you will notice that i constantly get distracted and start babbling incoherently. i'll try to write this paper very spontaneously so you get the right picture; but be warned. right before looking at the incredibly outstanding webpage (yeah right!) for my psy class, i was thinking where else could i surf the web, or if i should go to the pool here at my pearl st. co-op, or if i should start reading a bit, which is a definite no. i mean, it's friday!, or if i should write to my parents down in mexico city, etc, etc. so basically, i was evaluating everything i could possibly do in this boring friday afternoon, when what i really anted to do was nothing. but i've had exactly three months of that since school in mexico ended the 25th of may; and i immediately decided to do something productive which is this. i guess my mind is still warming up from all that time of null intellectual activity, and i'll get right back on track again. to tell you the truth, i think i am ready to start doing everything the right way, and not to procrastinate, which has been a big problem since i was born (i guess) or maybe it was because of my upbringing, or just because of the culture which i am a part of. as you may notice, i read chapter one yesterday and i can certainly notice a change in how i view things in my life and the life of others. in other words, i am starting to think in a psychological perspective already! the 20 minutes are over, and i can say that for a moment there, i was really concentrated and just writing all of this. but just as i noticed that the time was up, i started to wonder into something else again. i think that it was probably because my attention span is a bit short, but i know i'll get better. thanks for taking a little swim into my spontaneous and disordered thoughts and i hope i was not that boring. now i guess i've done my productive ""thing"" for today, and i can take a swim into the pool right in front of me! or maybe not. we'll see what my mind tells me later.

"i just got back to my dorm from my friend's dorm. i'm so tired. my eyes feel blurry cause i need to take out my contacts and my head hurts. oh man my head really hurts. at johnny's dorm, he tried to tickle me by grabbing my neck which is where i'm most ticklish. everyone knows that and yet he still grabbed my neck. so i leaned back away from him in order to escape and i hit my head on the shelf thing by the bed. what a loud noise there was. it hurts so much. anyways, i can hear the fridge making sounds right now and it smells like korean food in my dorm. my roommate just had korean food. i'm not really used to the smell and it kinda bothers me but there is nothing i can do about it. speaking of which, that is why i'm never in my dorm and i'm always at my other friends' dorm. it's because of the korean food smell. plus, we don't have a tv in our room and it makes it kinda boring. i can now hear clicking noises from the mouse that my roommate is using and the typing on the keyboard. i like the clicking sounds. i don't know why but for some reason i think of horses walking everytime i hear the keyboard. i've always liked the sound. man this room smells like korean food and i don't like my jeans because they feel too short on me. i think they shrunk because yesterday i was an idiot and i washed them in hot water. i don't know what i was thinking. i meant to put warm water but i accidentally pushed hot. i told my friend danny about it and he was so nice. he came over to try to help me cancel the wash but he was not able to. my pants feel short now and they are exposing my ankles and i'm wearing low ankle socks and its annoying because my ankles feel cold. my hair is also in my face and the a'c is making it move in my face and its really annoying because its blowing in my face. my roommate just went to the restroom. i hate the sound of the door opening. the door makes this stupid and annoying creaking sound. i don't know of any door that does that. why does she have to slam the door? why can't she close it quietly? how come when i leave i am nice enough to close the door. ahhh! the phone is ringing. its a scary sound cause its so loud. but yea anyways, why can't she close the door quietly? well, i don't like my laptop. i hate typing on this thing. i spent so much on it and i don't know but the keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. everytime i type something it jumps back a few spaces and then i have to erase and retype. so i put in a new cordless keyboard and its much better. i really ought to get my laptop checked out. i mean i spent so much on it. it has to work! i need danny to come and look at it for me. he is like the computer genius. speaking of which, i forgot to ask him today what a database is. today in mis, i had a guest speaker and she kept using the word database and i didn't know what it meant. i hate computers. i really do. i don't know anything about them and it makes me feel dumb. my neck itches now and so does my head and my hair doesn't look so nice today. i would have had time to straighten it except that my friend phan wanted to go eat breakfast and so i had to rush. i hear noises in the ceiling. its probably from the people living above me. at first when i heard noises, i thought they sounded like rats scurrying in the roof but then i realized it can't be the roof because i don't live on the top floor of the dorm. man i'm glad i don't live in jester east cause it smells over there. in jester west it is so much nicer. gosh, i'm itching all over! i need to shower tonight. my back also hurts. its been hurting for a while now. i keep asking my friends to give me a massage. i think i have back problems. i hope they aren't severe. i can hear the bathroom door closing even though the bathroom is across the hall. that's the thing i don't like about living in a dorm. you can hear everything all around you. i think my roommate may be coming back cause the door closed and i hear footsteps. the water is dripping in the sink. i can't make it stop. i just realized it right now and its really bothering me. drip, drop, drip, drop. its really bothering me now. i just thought of something. i wonder if i'm suppose to be putting indentions and starting new paragraphs for this writing assignment. oops. i should have thought of it sooner because now its just one really long paper. i hope i don't get points taken off. i hear my cell phone ringing but i'm not going to pick it up. i'll call the person back later i guess. oh yeah, my cell phone. its really weird. i set a certain ringer and it does not ring with the ring tone that i picked out. it rings with a totally different one. i don't get it. my roommate just got back and my friend lena is also hear. i see that she has starbucks. i love starbucks. i want coffee now. ooo, coffee. i have this coffee chocolate candy bar. no one likes it. i don't know why. it tastes so good. people just don't know anything about chocolate. why did my roommate and lena leave again? its quite again and i can hear the water dripping. man, my arm keeps itching and i have to keep scratching it. they've reentered and now they have just left. i wonder what jennie and lena are up to. and she slammed the door again. geez! anyway, i just remembered that i'm suppose to call my mom. she told me to call her every night and i've forgotten to call her. so now i've got to call her.

okay right now i'm so worried about many things. i just don't know what i want out of my life i am just so confused. i know what i want to be but i'm just so worried about making the grades that all i can think about a lot is school. which i guess is good because they say if you worry enough about it that you'll end up doing good. it's just so tough for me not to worry about everything because i'm know on my own and i have to prove to everyone that i can make it and i can be independent. all throughout my life i've strived for the moment when i can be on my own and not have my parents or anyone else holding anything over my head. well if schools not enough to worry about i have all of this other stuff like my relationship's with my friends and guys in particular. for instance i came here to austin with a boyfriend and not within two weeks i wanted to have an open relationship. when he came down to visit i was a complete bitch to him because i felt like i would have been missing out if i devoted all of my time to him. anyways i know have found this totally awesome guy but the only problem is he is 24 years old and well i'm 18 and i think it's okay but i don't know exactly how he feels about it. i don't think he thinks to badley of it because he took me out on a date and he's invited me out again. but i can't help but think it is because i'm young and he thinks he can have his way with me. and i know he is really nice and such a great guy but i'm just so suspiciuos of all the guys up here because were in a big college town and a lot of the guys can only think about getting one thing! then also my ex-boyfriend keeps calling me from japan because he's in the marines and he still fantazsies that we are going to get back together when he gets out. and i can't help but be nice to him or anyone else for the main fact that down the road of life who knows who your going to need a favor from. ,0,-0.297705 -1.197698 1.540474 -1.31575 -0.556897 -1.458917 -1.340314 -0.540968 -0.291006 -0.957751 0.055424 -0.590446 -0.057801 0.721241 -0.590212 0.0 -0.04277 1.238272 0.36661 -0.410818 0.276172 0.378883 1.254053 -0.20224 1.109144 -0.253895 1.141857 -0.224266 -0.416861 -0.567991 -0.533386 -1.430891 0.030014 3.117264 -0.562055 -0.503728 1.636078 1.707334 2.056697 0.517071 -0.121987 -0.361659 1.091379 -1.157686 -1.429535 -0.68772 0.383191 1.154623 -1.124455 1.370469 0.682241 -0.840756 -0.628598 -0.180147 -0.332385 1.218491 0.48432 1.095303 0.713214 0.324065 -0.535937 -1.600134 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.109489 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.216946 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.070044 0.008702 -0.422267 0.908489 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.229293 5.344089 4.073531 5.083902 5.241135 4.704596,980

"i just don't feel like i have quite gotten into the groove of school yet. i hate that we start before labor day, because i feel like i am just getting my schedule back to normal when i get another vacation. i think i'm going home to see my mom this weekend, my birthday is tomorrow and hers is on monday so were going to have a girls weekend, shopping, makeovers, haircuts, i can't wait. i wish that glenn was coming with me though, i hate to travel by myself, especially flying, i'm glad the flight only takes an hour but i really do not like to fly. i can't imagine going to europe and being on a plane for an entire day, i would want to jump out, it just makes me feel trapped at least when your in the car you can stop along the way for a travel break. anyway, besides getting ready for this weekend, i have a lot of homework i need to finish, so i can have fun while i'm home, my horoscope told me today was a good housecleaning day, i've been needing to do that ever since glenn's party, so i better do it today, or ill have to wait till the next full moon, or favorable planetary alignment!:) i don't really believe in horoscopes, but i still read them, especially around my birthday, silly superstition i guess, my horoscope for this week said i should do something memorable and kind of crazy for my birthday. i'm thinking that's not such a bad idea. i've only got a couple more years left that its still socially acceptable for me to be irresponsible. what crap, i hope i'm doing pseudo-irresponsible (not life-threatening and stupid, just fun) until i'm very, very old. its so weird that i would want to be like that, because i don't think i give off that image to the world. actually taking risks really scare me and i avoid them in real life as much as possible, but my rich a varied fantasy life is full of them. this should give you a clue to how type a i am, my fantasies about taking risks usually just include planning them, hardly ever actually doing them. where was i? oh yeah birthday, so i'm kind of bummed out bc i gave glenn a really great party and bought him lots of presents bc at the time we had money, but surprise his stupid company hasn't paid him yet so right now a great birthday present for me would be to pay the bills. i'm feeling a little guilty about the way i spent money on him, when i sort of knew what the situation would be, but i can't do anything about it now, and i feel like its selfish of me to want him to reciprocate what i did for him. i guess that's my spoiled only child coming out. i really did have fun watching him opening his presents and enjoying his party, i didn't do those thing so he would do the same for me, but i would be nice! okay back to school i'm feeling okay about most of my classes even chemistry, but i do not want to fail calculus again! that would suck, i already dislike the prof's teaching style. i know he wants us to learn by understand the proofs, he thinks that doing tons of problems for practice, which is what i like, is a ""high school"" way to learn, he actually really gets on my nerves. i really don't care about understanding calculus, i don't even have to take the second part, i just want to memorize formulas and pass the tests, too bad it doesn't seen to work like that in his class. i guess if i just keep up with it should be okay, that was my problem last semester, i just kept getting further and further behind, and tried to cram the night before the final. that works in my liberal arts classes, but in none of my science classes, which i guess in a strange way is why i like them. when i enjoying what i'm learning i don't mind reading everyday, and usually by the end of the semester i can really apply what i've learned in broader terms. it was really cool to see that a lot of the methodology and general theories i learned in my ecology classes were also used in psy. calculus is not one of those things i feel like i'm going to enjoy ",1,1.481813 -0.368561 -1.487648 -0.389373 -0.120996 -0.408611 0.411561 0.481663 1.211026 0.46603 0.096772 -0.038669 -0.363824 -0.817765 0.607808 0.0 -0.04277 0.280589 0.616225 -0.187251 0.59974 -0.15142 0.304866 -0.545316 1.659625 0.279759 -0.06167 -0.795202 0.670486 0.535992 0.39353 -0.555534 0.545676 -0.552619 0.664013 -0.79015 0.207755 -0.906173 -0.231924 0.575054 1.377083 -0.551496 -1.64902 -0.358352 0.208698 -1.092065 0.722487 -0.755732 -0.904327 -0.038025 -0.919192 0.180843 0.063605 -0.619574 -0.438649 -0.954142 -0.749224 -0.414148 -0.885009 -0.293516 0.279973 -0.31877 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.144988 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.418044 1.822847 0.050202 -0.23436 -0.373369 0.105479 0.027404 0.170281 0.594368 0.322794 0.04875 0.159606 4.917381 3.53584 4.573101 4.807865 5.104785,459
"i really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. i met this really hot guy at my dorm and i want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of rain meada at all but what can i say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. i can't believe that it was 112 degrees the other day. i wish that i would have made the dance team, but i guess i knew that i wouldn't. i really want to change my major. i hate ballet with a passion and today i felt sick to my stomach in class because i hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. i wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. i really want a boyfriend. i dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. i was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. i want to meet justin timberlake so bad. i just want to have sex with him. i miss my brother and i can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 3 months. and he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. i really don't like my classes and i already have trouble getting myself to class. i am such a bad student. i wonder where sammy is today? i really want him back but that will never happen. i pretend that there is a chance but i am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. i don't know that pisses me off so much i want to scream. i think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. i will have to go and meet him. i'm hungry and i feel extremely fat. i was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when elaine makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. i think i like patobut i'm not really attracted to him. i wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe i am and i just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. it psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. i feel bad that i have not made time for god in my life and i want to but then i find fun things to do and forget. i need to pray about that. i can't wait to meet the man that i'm going to marry. i'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes i think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. i feel bad for casey and i really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. i don't think he has ever been nice to me. oh well his loss. i am so broke right now. i need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. i wonder if my finger is broken or not. i can't decide if i want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. i never have a life anymore. i think i'm really going to hate school. maybe i will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like i'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. i hate writing journals for dumb modern class. that's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. i need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? i'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment i've ever done. my english teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and i never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and i wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and i started crying. my dog died when i was little. i miss my cat at home but i don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. i want to meet him and ask him. i think i will. birmingham is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him i would do anything. man i just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang i can't wait. i want to talk to zal. i wonder if he is back from paris yet? i think i'm don't know so yeah.

 i am so happy i can't really explain how i feel just that i am feeling great. i know the reasons why i am so happy i just feel like telling everyone that i am so happy and i just want to smile a lot. i would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in austin that i don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. anyways i have had so many hard days these past days buti think that i am going to be okay. i don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. today i actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university i can make others see me. okay right now my feet hurt so much i did so much walking today just like the other days. the difference is that i got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. anyways i think i have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when i bought them. which is good because i usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. oh if i misspell a word i am so sorry but its just that when i am happy i can't really concentrate on spelling. i'll try not to make so many mistakes. i have gone back and captalized all the i's that weren't captalized. right about now i feel my brain fried of so much thinking. so i met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but i can't say who he is. besides that i am really happy i feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. all this happiness is thanks to god because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. so thank you so much jesus because without you i would not be were i am today and who i am. i know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how i feel and what i am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. i so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase i have her in my heart and in a dvd that my sister made for her. so any time i want to hear my mom's voice i just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. i wish i could describe this feeling and share it with every one but i can't. it's great! anyways my minutes are almost up but after this i am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. i usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. one teacher told me that if i wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them. ,1,0.265323 -0.512719 1.100754 -0.848629 -0.079841 0.132909 -1.251495 -1.190551 -0.436535 -0.43898 -0.047003 -0.590446 -0.56184 0.152704 -0.6398 0.0 -0.04277 0.32785 0.783391 -0.795527 0.61231 0.102603 0.101468 0.011362 1.988211 -0.992216 -1.715261 -0.561335 -0.226032 0.6804 2.744325 -1.01368 -1.053635 -0.906028 -1.017959 0.259804 1.278543 1.106174 0.930417 1.146578 -1.038726 0.264009 -1.172935 0.783815 -0.648723 0.390172 1.874035 0.097102 0.793972 0.072061 -0.123612 -0.531355 0.252935 1.018152 0.103755 -0.417113 0.49683 -0.954251 -0.855645 2.190494 -0.881886 -0.867268 0.612766 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.812252 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.144467 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.271939 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.272373 5.411383 3.73636 4.799681 4.84268 4.352028,2369
"i was just thinking about how different college is from high school. i haven't come home from going out every night until 2am and i think my roommate is getting really upset with me. i feel bad because she never goes out and when i tell her i'm going out i think she feels left out. i am going to start inviting her. we knew each other in high school and now we're living together which is kind of weird but it's working out really well. people always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but it's been working so far. she is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meit's fun. i just broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years last weekend. that was really tough because we were so close. he doesn't go to ut so that was making it really difficult. i miss him. i am dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated a year earlier. he's really cool and we get along but it isn't the same. we'll just see how it works out. i miss my family. i am so used to seeing them everyday and now that i don't it's weird. i was so ready to get out of the house but now that i am officially out it's sad. i feel so old. i have to be independent which stinks. when i first got here, my computer wasn't working so i had to take it to the repair place and i got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously. that was kind of liberating, though. doing something important by yourself. i was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant. i always had my mom do it. so, coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird. i haven't had much homework lately. i thought college was really tough and so far it really hasn't been. my roommate has tons of homework every night and i just haven't. i feel like i am missing out on the college experience. today, i am going to college station to visit my friend. we are going to see pat green in concert which will be totally awesome. i love pat green. my roommate is going to the dave matthews concert in dallasi am jealous. she has been home every weekendthat's probably not healthy. her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him a lot. i think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home. i don't really think she is homesickjust bored. austin is such a great citypeople always told me that once you go to austin you won't want to leave. i can see how that can happen. there's always something to do. i am starting to run out of things to talk abouti think my 20 minutes are almost over. i found somethingthe freshman 15. i am not going to gain thatbut, i can definitely see how that happens. you definitely have more spare time in college than we did in high school. i was really busy in high school. i was on drill team and i had practice every night until 7. i didn't have much time to myself. now i do. i get bored. my dad just got a new car. it's weird that he has a new car and i've never seen it. my little sister had her 12th bday yesterday and she told my momwhen is sara coming home? my mom said, she lives three hours away, she can't come home tonight because she'll have to drive back for class the next day. when my mom told me that i started crying because it hasn't hit my little sister yet that i moved out. we used to not be close but we are nownow that we are growing up. well, my 20 minutes are upit's been nice talking to you.

"when i first heard about our first writing assignment, i figured it would be very difficult because i am used to writing about a specified subject matter. but hopefully i can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how i feel. actually, i think i'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. it was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that i might feel or think. i also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. well, i don't have much of either (self-esteem' self-confidence). hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in austin i will develop these traits. when i first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. i almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' i mean, i knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, i was not able to do it. for example, i hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! so i naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because i wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. but i quickly learned here, that you have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. in fact, the question i probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. so i think i have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. in addition, i would always do everything with my friends. and upon coming to austin, i feel'felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. usually, i'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. so these past few weeks, i did not let myself do that. i very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. this was very rewarding, in that, i don't feel as lost in such a big university, and i'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. this is a characteristic which i will need for my expected major. i'm still not too keen on what exactly i want to do because when i think about it, i want to do'be everything, but when i think about it again i don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! but i think i'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. i'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down that much. but i still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. i don't know if i should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. so i'm really confused about that. hopefully, i will learn more about myself through my college journey at ut.

"my chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. i find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. i have come to the realization that indian producer people truly are strange. this realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. i mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. the people upstairs just made another random noise. it sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. i'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since i don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. i really don't know what they do upstairs. the people next door to us are just as strange. they screen their phone calls i think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. but then i hear them in their room. actually, i'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. we've gotten some random phone calls. some of these calls came from people i know very well and yet i can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. i just realized that i have very random thoughts; i think that this means that i'm not really focused on what i'm doing or something. actually, i'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. i just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. that is quite sad; generally i always have something that i can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. yet when i'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. i wonder when i'm going to get rid of my cough. i refuse to take cough syrup because i don't like the taste of it, and so i'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. i don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. that would most definitely not be a good thing. i guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. at least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. grape is a good flavor. chocolate is a good flavor too. i like chocolate. actually i like all sugar; i think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar i intake daily is what causes my oddness. but sugar is good nevertheless. so is chocolate. i don't think it causes acne. how can something that tastes so good be so bad? of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, italian food, etc). ah well. i never knew twenty minutes could last so long. it's neverending. i feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. there was just another random thud from the people next door. i think they must have dropped something plastic. i just realized that i don't really know any of the people who live around me. i think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. that's kind of sad, considering i hear from everyone that ""people who live on the same floor as you become your family"" and i don't really seem to sense that. we all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. that, to be honest, is the one thing i didn't like about ut. the fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. we all have our high school buddies. well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. if i had counted the number of times i hit the backspace button during this exercise, i think i would come up with this huge number. i never knew i'm so bad at typing; i have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet.

"man these computer labs on campus are so sad, everybody seems dead. i guess its probably because its sunday. i feel tired too wish i could go to sleep. i guess i would if i didn't have all this work to do. can't believe its already 2 weeks into school. it still feels like summer. well i guess before i know it its going to be finals. man i need to call nathan and get that hw of him. wow that girl is pretty hot. she probably is not that hot but i guess being in the engineering school you got to accept what you can get. man i wish i didn't do engineering. can't believe its been 4 years. i really hate it but i guess it will get me a job. i guess that is why i did engineering. i wish i had done architecture. i can't draw but still its seems so much more fun. i used to suck at drawing in high school. i guess its a talent. man i wish those two girls would shut up they have been liking whispering for 20 minutes. i hate people who whisper i rather them just talk loud, even though its lab. its very irritating. thank god she left. man i can't believe dallas lost that game. they played so damn carp. so much for paying bill parcells 17million bucks. they are never going to win if they don't get a new qb. carter sucks, its been like 3yrs they should realize he can't play. well screw it. i so want to be done with school, i can't believe these freshman classes. they all look like a bunch of kids, they seem so damn enthusiastic and happy to be in school. it will be funny to see them in 4 years and see what they think then. that girl in government class, i have never seen somebody so happy to be taking a class. i wonder if i was like this when is was freshman. i guess i was excited to be in college. always wanting to party and stuff. but i don't know if i was as crazy as sara's sister. she is well on her way to the freshman 15. crazy girl. but i don't think i partied as much, maybe i did. i feel old. i really need to get out of austin. getting tired of this town.

"i am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which i don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. i like that movie 50 first dates. i said that because i'm watching t. v. oh i already said that. well any way i am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so i won't have a lot to do during the week. i'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. i wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. i pray to god that she's. i had one of those pop ups come up because i am on my slow, old computer. i watching the monk. i love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and i'm starting to get tired of watching it. i hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. i like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so i think it's her turn to take the crown. i am almost half way through this writing assignment. i keep reminding myself that i need to take a look at the experiments so i can sign up for them. i forget how many hours i need. oh i just looked at the paper, it says 5 hours. i don't know what to write because i haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. i wish my friends lived in austin then i wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. i hope this isn't the same monk, it is so i need to change the channel. i don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. i hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. i hope i got my class code right because i didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now i'm watching the source awards from two years ago on bet. i got to find something a little better to watch. i just changed to what not to wear. i think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then i would be affended that people don't like the way i dress. i have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. i have this filling that i might win the lottery but i guess everyone has that feeling. i love to talk about what i would do if i won the lottery. i would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. i would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. i would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because ",0,-1.184056 0.391439 -0.570569 0.47548 0.049087 0.173023 -0.95621 -0.914561 -0.664524 -0.283727 -0.178486 -0.590446 -0.264695 -0.007032 -0.454219 0.0 -0.04277 0.14368 0.231083 -0.525521 0.102292 -0.742368 0.330716 -0.978079 -0.624052 0.460883 0.285834 -0.183362 -0.567514 0.779069 -0.304559 2.84326 -1.659037 -0.906028 -0.697986 -1.109326 0.657689 1.18185 -0.825746 1.179534 0.891493 -0.232701 -0.68039 1.714458 3.660788 0.557446 -0.748022 0.360758 0.857838 -0.155099 -0.207629 -0.1208 -0.142721 0.181543 -0.260199 0.289063 1.537196 0.484213 -1.074264 0.1784 -0.215509 0.788741 0.537707 0.181041 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.25326 -0.793195 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.641882 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.275375 4.924124 3.054526 4.916662 4.971782 4.156135,2420
"autumn will be here soon. i wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city. down. down the elivator once again, floor 13, now floor 1. i step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. this is where i realsize that everyday is but a breath. that single inhale was a day, was a life. old postcards line my smile. i am a story, and i tear up when i thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. my eyes desperately search for ideas, while i know they are all within some governing organ i possess. heart or head, it doesn't matter. but i find it odd that my eyes do the searching. my little fan is growling at me. it's probably upset that i always leave it on. let me turn it off really quick. ok. done. i heard a door shut. the people in my dorm are an infestation. i cannot stand them. i try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can i if they are all the same. everyday i walk around the autumn grasping campus and i look. look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. i look at the people. they make me laugh! we are so strange. i see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an ipod pumping sound into their skulls. people who try to look sexy. people who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. people look at me too. what is it that i possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. my heart races when they do that. it's kind of a love. i love them for that one milisecond. i understand them for one lapse of time. but did they look at me because i was looking toward them? am i attractive to them? am i mysterious? scary? sexy? sometimes people look at me. that's my job. i absolutely hate being in here. trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. i cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. i don't watch tv, i don't keep up with any news, i listen to music and read books. entertainment is all i need on media terms. we should kill our tv's though. as one of my favorite bands says ""i wish the world was flat like the old days"". i have to say: amen. we need to evolve backwards! we need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. we need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. but, i suppose it's just wishfull thinking.

" so today has completed a very odd and trying week. i have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and wow!!! i seem to find myself asking, have i over done myself? i am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this i got two kittens that require a lot of attention. this, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work i have to make sure i am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but i love them. my roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like i am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? i am not trying to say i don't take their words into consideration but i believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he'she learns. this is a test for me that i hope i don't fail at but all i keep telling myself is that i must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). i am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. she found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. the doctor said she should be alright but i still worry. i really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. all i can conclude is that i have been set a full plate that i now must eat. besides all the drama i just mentioned i have finnaly declared my major as child development' pre-med with a minor in psychology. this is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which i am very thankful for. i know it will be a lot of work but i love working with children, but now whether i follow all the way through with pre- med is a different story but i know eventually i will get through it and go to med-school. for right now i need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. another thing i am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that i could have gotten two tickets the the ou game and i passed up the opportunity. there goes a couple hundred dollars i coould have gotten off ebay. oh well, that's the way life goes. by the way, my boyfriend of three years, zack, took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. we had 12 courses in 5 1'2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). the cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). anyhoot i enjoyed writting and i will see you next time, bye.

" so far i have been at ut for i guess 6 school days, and i can already feel myself slipping. school was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. why can't i go back? let's see. what did i do today? i woke up around 2 (we have lives around here), and was bugging my sister to take me to church. i haven't been there since i don't know how long, but i need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and i don't know how it made me feel. i want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. i don't want to desert him, but i don't know what he wants from me and what i can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth i have no idea what i was thinking when i went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. i don't know how i feel about him. i would like to be his friend, but that's it, and i also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing? guys. don't they all suck? i wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason i am still waiting for him to reply. i don't know what's wrong with me. maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. i get really tired and depressed when i think about my ex and i don't know what to do about it. i want to be his friend, but i know he wants more and i don't think i can offer him that. i need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. he comes from a broken home and has a lot of problems that i don't want to deal with. he's from port arthur and asked me to come down for his birthday. funny i was actually considering it. what's wrong with me? i called my little sister (12 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. neither were my parents. i think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and i miss them a lot. i need to come back and visit and i don't think i can do that until christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than christmas break. it really bothers me that i didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but i shouldn't be worried about that right? i am so unenergized right now. i need to go jogging or something, but it is late. i can't believe princess diana died. mother teresa also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as princess di. so much has happened in my short 17 years life span. i can actually tell my kids that i was alive when princess di and mother teresa died. it seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad? i just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. i don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to? my cousin is going through a break up right now and i don't know what i can do to help. i know she can do better than him, but i also know that she likes him a lot. what's a girl to do? i am really relieved that i don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am i still commenting on that? i was a lot better before he called. i just wish he could disappear and i don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is? i think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. i don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and i still have other things to do. thank goodness i remembered about this. i actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that i try to do at least twice a week. i really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 35 minutes so i'm outta here. lan ngoc ngo ",1,-0.695249 0.083016 1.370754 -0.332271 0.426398 0.681221 -1.18431 -1.220191 -1.323853 0.515256 -0.195627 1.730263 -1.105161 -0.257122 -1.335027 0.0 -0.04277 1.034862 0.385203 -0.59603 0.245913 -0.160927 1.603974 -0.778518 -0.624052 -1.330861 -0.750893 -0.094982 -0.761448 -0.854726 -0.806286 -1.1438 -0.026712 -0.210583 -0.781544 0.460881 1.238932 0.141082 1.103635 0.947975 -0.563338 -1.221466 -1.655712 -0.535997 -1.160889 0.230698 -0.072484 0.962637 -0.200209 1.017132 -0.084246 -1.104213 0.286327 0.745976 0.073132 -0.331019 -0.77134 -0.422838 0.159492 0.661566 -0.301792 0.164913 -0.104129 -0.060837 -0.206488 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.0406 -0.459921 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.92968 -0.37208 0.380165 -0.422267 1.22768 1.834095 0.716632 0.560451 5.038298 4.057837 4.811583 4.823192 4.494494,10
" it is a rainy grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer has broken. i tell you what there is always something. more money more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so strange and makes me feel like i'm walking on a tight rope. i hate the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes the money chase. i will be getting back to work very soon. its been a strange summer hit over and over. it feels so good to see scott out of his brace!man he took that whole thing well. i think we both took it very well. its hard to see someone you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! i would have been a emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 3 months pretty well. free again,yes! my house always seems to become a mess, i just cleaned a day ago. it's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. i never seem to keep up with a journal i only write in them when i'm sad or depressed. what a shame i could learn so much about myself . my grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 2 pages a day. speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 3 letters from her and still have not written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! less talking more doing. that is so like me, i'm working on it but i love to talk about the things i need ' want to do instead of just going for it. like working-out its silly . ok i am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out.

"it is 5:24 in the afternoon. i wonder how long 20 minutes really is and how much i can write. time always seems to go by so slow when i'm bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, i'm in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. i hated him when i was a kid. we were in the same chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. i guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. i'm so bored. the only noise i hear is the humming of the a'c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. i'm really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. i hate bugs of any shape and size. all i know is that i'm beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 5:35 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy da dee da. i don't know what to write. the more i sit here, the more impatient i get and the more paranoid i am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an asian fraternity house. i'm not trying to say asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. i wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. i hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow'brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. i basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that i paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while i'm in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 5:41. and frank and my friend tony just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though i don't like mcdonalds, i always crave it when i smell it. oh well, i'm just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah!

" i am doing a stream of conscience assignment for pyshcology. am i suppose to use correct grammar and punctation? i hope not. i still type using one finger, but i think i can type pretty fast foer using one finger. you think since i am using one finger that i wouldn't make any grammatical mistakes but that's not true. oops am i suppose to time this? oh, no you time it for me. wow 20 minutes is a long time. i don't even look at the screen when i type. just the keybopard. my hands are tired. my favorite channel is tlc. it's great. right now a story about conjoined twins are on. my boyfriends is back in plano. my thoughts jump around faster than i can type i don't have any thoughts anymore ihad to turn off the tv all i could do was listen to it maybe that is why i ran out of thoughts maybe that is why people say tv frys (or is it fries?) your brains i don't think tv makes you studpi there are plenty of educational shows my sister learned to read through sesame sttreet, i don't miss my parents much is that bad? it was kind of annoying living at home with them my phone is rinignfg am i allowed to get that i guess i can call them back in like 15 minutes i think it is the guy i met from they gym who was calling. college doesn't feel like its satarted. it still feels like summer fore me. i only have class every other day so its kind of hard getting into tht study mode. am i writing too much. am i suppose to just write a few thoughts as i have them or cointinuously type. i hope its continuosouyl type cause that is what i am doing. do ya'll actually read this? i wouldn't really want my real stream of consciencce read. ithink thoughts and emotions are very personal and should only be expressed or shown in needed situations or with a person you trust. what if my real stream of conscience was that i wished somebody would blow up ut ( which it's not i promise). ya'll would redflag me and secretly watch me, so i don't really like doing this assignment. i don't mind it actually. it's pretty simple and something interesting to do, i guess a way to learn about yourself. i don't like writing much. i use to keep a journal but i was too lazy to write in it all the time. usually when i wrote in it it was when i was pissed off, so everytime i went back and read it it seemed like i was a really angry person all the time. i wantred the journal to be like a memory book. but, if i was feeling any strong emoitons ii didn't feel like writing in it. i guess i probably talked on the phone. my cell phone gets horrible reception here. it is hard to talk to my boyfriend back in plano cause he always breaks up. he's not really my boyfriend anymore, but he really is. i don't think that makes sense. ten more minutes. so. my nails are shiny i'm tired of doing this. i don't get why we are doing this either. if mine is this long and there about 300 people in each class and say there are about 5 classes, that's 1,5000 papers. nobody probably reads this. it is probably random spot reading if anything so this will get submitted and overlooked so i don't really see a point in this i wonder if everybody has around the same stream of conscience. i bet a lot of people are writing about how they have to do this assignment and they don't see a point to it really. i don't know what i want to be when i grow up. i wanto to make a lot of money. i was gooing to do psychology but everybody is doing it. 1 out of 3 people i ask are a psychology major. it is very interesting and i loved it in highschool, but future wise there's not much you can do with it as i see it. there is a teacher or a psychologist or maybe a social worker. and if 1 out of 3 people are doing it at ut and there is about 50,000 people, wells that's about 17,000 pyschologists and teachers alone from ut, there is still to mention tech, and other schools where most people are doing psychology too. i think everyopne should take psychology though. but i think way too many people are majoring in it. actually, i think majoring in it fine so that way you can get an extensive look at how human nature and the mind functions, but i think that knowledge should be applied to other fields. so everyone should study pyschology, but not pursue a field in it. i really want to be a person who does case studies on dreams. i think dreams are so interesting. i had a dream about roseanne the show and that i met the cast. it's really weird. i remebr thinking i should get their autographs so i can put it up on my wall. sometimes, though, i think people see too much into dreams. i think people on drugs have deep dreams, or maybe they are having reaaly fake dreams. like their brain is just so confused it is just sending randome imaages. i don't now. i think drugs let ypou tap into another side of your brain. i think they can open your mind. i think drugs like x can open your mind, but i think that you should learn how to open your mind without drugs. i think no one should do drugs on a regular basis. i wonder if a lot of philosophy and psychology teachers have done drugs. i personally think they have one time or another, and if they haven't i wonder what their thoughts and reactions would be like to drugs. oprah did a show about x users, i only saw part of it. some of them said that it opened their eyes and that if they were doing their work and had a mental block, the drug would help their thoughts flow. oprah was still like that's very bad . i guess it is bad, they should learn to let their mind flows without drugs. it's sad if the only was you can open your mind is thru drugs.

"this is a little confusing. i am not quite sure what i ahould be doing. oh well i guess it really doesn't matter. i am glad i am going home this weekend. i really miss everyone. it will cool to just hang out at home and not have to worry about what i should be doing right now. college is a lot of reading. i am actually learning a lot more than i learned in a whole semester of high school. i enjoy that but it does get to be a bit tedious, expecially science. well iguess it can only get better form here on. i was confused about a lot of stuff, like what to do with all of my spare time. i was going to have a job but then they took away my work study and now i have too much free time. that's okay because i didn't really want to work anyway. but i can't believe the lady never called be back. tha t is just rude etiquette. oh well. there's nothing i can do about it anyway. i wonder why we are shunned by our dorm mates. i guess we weren't social enough or something. we tried. but at least they aren't outright mean to us, they are just very cordial and you know what that means. doh! oh well. it's fun rooming with ashley, i just don't know why she chooses to bother me on purpose sometimes. i think she can be very immature at times. but i would rather put up with that than with someone who barely talks or just doesn't like me for whatever reason. i don't want to go to all those meetings tonight that sucks! maybe i just won't go. but i probably will. i can't shirk my responsibilites just because i don't want to. maybe some people need to do that once in a while though. i wonder what plato would have to say about that. his books are cool. i like the idea of socrates just sitting around waiting to confuse people. if you make people question their own values, then what do you consider as your values? i don't know. lthat's just odd.

"feeling free right now. door underneath punded. resonated and left me shaking. there is music next to me and it has a beat. the bass bothers me sometimes. like when i was riding in the car with my brother when we went to the zoo that one time. he used to always pick on me but now he is not here. its not the first time that i hav enot seen him for awhile. but i see casey everyday. i like being here at ut. this apartment is great. just leaning against the bunkbed while typing feels great. i feel at home most of the time, except for tommy when he makes his comments. i keep expecting to have to go home and climb in my own bed but every time that i walk back to my dorm from here i realize that i am going to my new home , the dorm. my roommate is nice, she studies all the time. i feel that i don't study enough when i am with her. she is going to major in math just like i am. but i don't know what i want to do or if i really want math. this song is great. it makes me happy and hyper. but i am still upset that i don't know what i want to do. everyone here does. they all have their special thing and i am just feeling the way along. that is more comfortable. the keyboard is on my lap and now my hands or wrists rather don't hurt as much. i like psychology. i am excited about the experiments. from what dougs mom was talking about them earlier they sound like a lot of fun. but i don't know if i will be able to just go up and talk to people like that. i am glad that i will have casey in my class this year. he is so smart and wonderful and i love him. i am really glad that we are engaged. he is the best thing that has happened to me since i moved to texas. louisiana was not good at all but i have to stick up for it when doug and casey pick on me and tell me that i say things weirdly. this is a beautiful song. i really like it. but one bad thing about it is that i remember being with ryan when i listen to it. riding around in caseys car when we were first going out. we listened to her then too and i made him sing to aida. he has a beautiful voicce and i love to listen to him sing. i love the way her voice sounds and the different inflections in all the right places. my foot itches and now that i scratched it, everything else is itching too. sometimes they talk too much about computers and that junk. but that is their thing and it makes them happy. i just have to find what makes me happy. skiing. i want to go skiing, it is so hot here. skiing would be great and romantic. last year was the first time that i ever skiied and it was great. i did a lot of things with church that i had never done before but i think that all of these things were because i got together with casey. like this barbie girl song. i hated it but then he would always play aqua and i got to liking all of the songs and liking him more and loving him and falling for him and casey is wonderful. aqua' like an ocean or island. so peaceful and wonderful. i like heroes the game with amanda, it reminds me of lord of the rings. my hair tickles my face. my ear itches. doug has a cute voice. he is trying to sing. idont hate casey's cat. it is really cute. i just wanted to get him something better and i wish i could have found a cuter one so i have to put it down because i don't know why. it does not really matter. i overreact too much and am selfish and whine. this is kind of fun actually. i want to take a photography class next semester. my mom says that i am good at it. i jsut want to find something that i am good at. make everyone proud. but i put too much pressure on myself. i think that is why i am nervous this week because i want to adjust and i don't know if i am going to do well in my classes and i hope i do but am scared. my wrist hurts like when i am playing minesweeper. an addicting game. somethign i am good at, unlike half life which i am getting better at. my ear itches. i need to go to the store and get some cables, i hope to find them and understand how it works. physics scares me and i am not good at it. why am i majoring in math and how did sarah make up her mind in one weekend about college. i think those are the same reasons. time's up.

"a fire alarm sounded right before i was going to start this assignment. i had to walk down thirteen flights of stairs. when i got outside we had to walk across the street and stand there waiting for the magical voice to tell us that we can come back inside. naturally, i had to walk up up up up thirteen flights of stairs. at least i know how to exit if there is a real fire. it also has given me something to write about. i bet that there going to do this crap a couple times each semester. safety is a good thing. terrible disasters that can be eliminated with a little planning kill a lot of people. i read that somebody said "" a person that will trade freedom for security deserves neither. "" i think that it was benjamin franklin who said that. i don't liberals because they are not in the business of creating a more free society. they just want to create more of a bureaucracy to ensure more safety. gun laws are a good example. they think that if guns are illegal, that crime will go down. it sounds like a good idea to a lot of politically correct or pussified people. the real effect from that terrible idea would be less good people with guns and the same number of bad people with guns. the good people can't protect themselves in their own homes from the bad people that can easily get guns. duhhh, the constitution guarantees us our right to have guns, probably the only reason why we are still aloud to have them. england just passed laws that have allowed the government to confiscate all of its citizens' guns. that would be a nightmare that would not stand for. sometimes i think stuff this will happen. other freedoms that people had a hundred years ago, are gone today. my grandchildren and other ancestors might not even live by the same constitution that we live by today in this country. i really want to graduate school so that i can afford to have a lot of kids and still be able to put them through college. i'm the last erwin in my family so i hope my sperm will create a couple of boys with my wife. i wish that sex were not such a strong desire. it kind of gets in the way of being productive. the tvs and ads and the radio just pour on the sex appeal tactic because they know it's such a strong desire and emotion. i saw a cute girl when we had that fire drill. i think she was looking at me too. i should have said something to her. i wish i had more confidence to talk to girls. i wish i could stay drunk or high without the setbacks of puking and slurring words and possibly smelling funny. it's so easy to talk to girls when i'm inebriated.

" ok, i'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since i've been told i type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of mark's mind. i hope that no one reads this seriously at all. ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. that was fast, i'm telling you this is a waste of time and i'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. i'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. i miss my wife. yeah that's right my wife. we aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and i do. i certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because i actually do take it very seriously. i love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. now i'll write about pizza hut. they got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than i will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. i know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and i will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. i hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children i will do whatever i can to ensure this. i love my wife so much. i miss her terribly. there seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how i have many a time disputed the reality of free will. how can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. because if i had full free will i could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that i would be judged for my actions on earth. but since i couldn't choose whether or not i could be exposed to such information. i am a catholic. this is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. but the truth is that i consider myself a part of this religion yet i do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. for example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. my idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this: good people go to heaven. bad people go to hell. simple right? except what i qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. so what now? is my idea of good right or is theirs. but wait, the plot thickens. i have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. you see i believe that god instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. the most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something i find to be unacceptable i can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. i am almost always right in this aspect. every time i have seen something i think is wrong i can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. however, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. the hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. i am not proud of all that i've done in my life. the only reason i can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because i apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. i once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. one of the worst days of my life. there is no reason i can use to explain my actions. but i did it to end the relationship. yeah, i know what you're thinking. good job huh? well she didn't want to leave anyway. at least that was what i thought. i was so damn confused. i cheated on her, a rule i set for myself a long time ago was that i would never cheat on a girlfriend. and i did. i disgraced myself and i hate. er hated myself for it. i did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. should an infraction upon the rule about never cheating on my girlfriend i must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. i don't know if i'm wrong. but i could be. man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. now i'm listening to damien rice. the little known writer of some of the best music i've ever heard. i think he's great. it's kind of weird i guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but i do. i also like this guy joseph arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. i love the way i can relate to it. i recently read ""a streetcar named desire"". the female role of blanche. she is like my ex. she lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want"" never tell me what i want. only i know that and i don't appreciate being told. if anyone ever makes assumptions about who i am before i meet them. i get reasonably angry but i hide it pretty ok. you. for some reason i have been descrimanated against for being mexican twice in my life. both times by a girlfriends family. i have an extraordinarily pale complexion. the funny thing about that is one of them is mexican. heh what can i say.

"i wonder if he is thinking of me???? i am glad i am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now. i need to do all this as soon as i get it. i had done this before but i could not submit it. i have something special with alex and i know how he feels and he is different. he isn't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me. i hope not to hurt him. i need him and need someone like that. someone to take care of me and to be there for me if i need to talk someone to talk to me and someone that i can take care of and love too. he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful. he will never know i guess. he is there for me when i most needed him. he has held me when i cried and has made me laugh when i was sad' i owe a lot to him. we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun. i wonder if he knows how much fun i have had with him. i don't think he understands. i am going through a hard time and i am going through a big transition, but i think i am doing fairly well. i have not cried much. my roommate went home this weekend and i felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with. we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other. we are okay now. my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too. i don't want to be with him anymore, yet he still persists. he know that i am dating alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with. i want to get away from that i am tired of having to answer questions about my own life. i want to be free and to be able to do what i want and that i think is right not what other people think i should do. it isn't fair to me if i have to make someone else happy before i could do things for my own freedom. it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply can't be an individual. there are many things to do here in austin and many many people to meet and make friends with. i have had a good time so far and i have enjoyed going to class and learning. although i do think that i should read a little more. i will be fine though. claudia and alex will be there if i need anything.

" well it is about 1:20 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. i keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. i guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. i almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying hey you should be studying something! ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. the joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a b or c on a test rather than an a . i like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. so because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. right now my grades are very important to me. i feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. my success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. you must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. so in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in business. my happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 15 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. it makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. ha. . what a character. well no not really just a determined man. i like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. when i moved here from colorado i had an agenda and for the last 3 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. it gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. i see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. man i need to get some sleep. i took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the t . many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9'11. wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. the doctors say that she does not feel a thing. i really would like to believe them. it seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. the doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. i miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? it seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. i have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. maybe that is part of this writing experiment. have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. so when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. the mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. i read somewheres that in a thousand years the english language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. so they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the egyptians. . times up. . night.

"i am so upset with myself today. i am so far behind on my study god i hope i don't fail. i don't want to fail my mom. she would be so disappointed in me. i can't do that to her. class isn't what i thought it would be. and all the reading god, it is so annoying. brooke is pissing me off so much. you would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and lex out of her life. no she has to come down every weekend and steal lex away and get drunk. oh man that is so fun. yeah right. i mean lex is my friend too. i can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 7:00 every night. then you got homework and early classes. god i just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without brooke calling every ten minutes. you have to share lex, brooke. my roommate jana is really cool. she has a great outlook on life. she takes things as they go. i wish i was more like that instead of worrying about everything i do and what people will say. i mean being a girl at ut you have to look pretty to get a guy. so number 1 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. and why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. sorry i'm not into that. i can have fun without that stuff. jana has this guy she is in to. supposedly he is a charming jerk. he lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. that is all she talks about. i wish i could find a guy too so we could trade stories. me and jana are not from austin and decided to drive around today to the mall. boy was that stupid. i was so scared i thought we would never find our way back. god i can't get over the fact brooke would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. i think i will tell her to stay in arlington and make her own friends, i mean i made mine. i am so bummed. i keep thinking i am going to fail out of college. my brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. he was salutatorian in high school and i was only 8th. i am afraid i won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. i mean i have a kinesiology major. that is a joke to everyone i know. i haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid i have a test or quiz tomorrow. i am going to have to cram. i just don't want to fail. i am so scared about this. i know i will fail if i don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. i'm too lazy and tired of school. i just want to go out to the real world"" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. it would be a lot more easier. i figure if i just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is i don't have any concentration in me. i feel like i have add (attention deficit disorder). i really don't but it feels like it because i lack so much energy and motivation. i hope school is okay tomorrow because i do not want to have a bad day. i hate bad days they make me sad.

"what about this school, too many people running from place to place to be of any noticeable . meaning, any noticeable effect. i can't find the word trying to scribe all my thoughts brimming down. it is much easier for me to describe the pictures in my head, the vivid sensations i am accustomed to beholding within my minds own personal theater. i have developed my own way of thinking, so i like to think!, through day dreams and images, which i behold clearly even with my eyes open as if they happened in front of me. i like to write, but not this droning nonsense which may not receive the benefit of human eyes except for its execution and if, if it gets read. i am told it might not be, and it is this insignificance which repels me to the assignment. at least its easy, except for the internet part. i have generally avoided this dismal institution for my years, i spit upon the ""net"" when it first gained its genesis, and i spit upon its multi-media, machination which steals the waking lives from people. but what of it, for that matter, they do it to themselves, i can not pity them for that. if they like computers to sunsets let them use paintbrush to engineer their own nature, but i prefer the real thing made of so much chaos and chance that these simple number-crunchers couldn't make anything with that much sensation, that much depth. that is what lacks in these computers, they are vicarious to life. not that i condemn them, they are useful tools, and not that i condemn their junkies or pushers for the fact of the creation, and not that i live my life to its fullest potential as it may sound i condemn the computer junkies for not doing. its just that, i guess, i have found my own niche in the wall of the world, my own peaceful way of doing things that is inhibited by the computer only slightly, in the way that i hate it and most embrace it. i am hypocritical in this matter as well: i own a computer myself, and use it nearly every day. i like to think, probably falsely, that my downfall in the machine is not so complete as those web-surfers who spend 8+ hours browsing the electronic dreams of men. but then, my won mind produces the dreams i live in: whose to say which is worse? i prefer to see pictures of the world inside my own mind, and i can contrive any number of vicarious situation, locations, persons, emotions, sunsets, anything i want with a near vivid copy of the real things my eyes behold. is this the same as the infernal computer? is this any less debilitating a habit to daydream in ways even more real than my own, insignificant life? i say insignificant, and i mean it, not in a degrading matter or that i don't feel i have made full use of my potential or that i want for a better standard or situation in my own life, but that it is the truth that all humans are insignificant, no matter how important or influential, save in the numbers of our immense crowd. i'm sure philosophers have pondered the subject as i do right now for a useless computer, but as i have mentioned, i prefer the daydream, i prefer the novel, and i prefer the realistic sunset to a game of doom(not to say that the particular pastime isn't fun, i'm just as guilty as wasting an hour or so, but i haven't followed it up as many have with the endless assortment of clones that rock the computer gaming industry). i am bored with writing this as though i think in words, because normally i do not. normally i prefer to think in sight, in sound, and even smell(though that's a hard one to master, i don't think i shall). so now i think its time to stop this wonderment i have going and describe what i think about when i don't do it in words: flashing colors, sometimes geometric-shapes, until i can find something to build the energy in mind into. i remember during psych class when i began to waver off(which i am in habit of doing, sometimes at the wrong moment), daydreaming about my kendo class coming up soon. i thought about a stalwart master standing over me as i held out a bamboo sword, poised straight and steady. i though about going over the moves i knew so well, i am quite a fan of kendo and cannot wait to take the actual class. i hope, though, that my daydream will predict some of the success i hope to have, but i still recognize that it was not real, only a contrivance, and i will have to wait for the fact to see. back tot he daydream i enjoy remembering, and have thought about since. i then imagined as though i were past the class, but somehow not in the real world as we know it, but somewhere where the sword still ruled the land. i think now it must have been my own idea of feudal japan, but needlessly i walked around in nothing but a (i forget now what the karate uniforms i have donned so many times are called) but i was wearing one of those, carrying a real sword this time, trudging through muddy roads through a country side constantly lit by an orange, pasty sun. i can't remember where it went form there, but needless to say much violence, honor, and success followed. that's how my daydreams sometimes run, but sometime they are more erratic. sometime i let my mind go, though i do have extensive control, and watch bizarre unfoldings before me of pictures melting together, sometimes a forgotten memory boiling up from the depths of my mind, but more often a collage of unearthly landscapes. i have done extensive travel in the southwest of our country, sometimes willing, sometimes not, and have amassed a great many memories of the landscapes. enough memories, in fact, to create my own realistically, though vicariously, through my daydream ability. sometimes i imagine titanous walls of huge cliffs, eaten away by a river evidently, but impossibly showing the scores of rain as though it were eroded by that force alone, topped with greenery though the valley below is of rocks and tumbled stones. i like to visualize. i like to visualize so much that on the last vacation i made special note to remember the best landscapes i saw, and discovered in the process that i couldn't remember the scenes if i wore sunglasses. without them, i could remember the sharpness of shiprock, the depth of the grand canyon, the crumbling stones of chaco and mesa verde. but with sunglasses on, i found i could not remember the details, they seemed clouded and sometimes distorted as thought he glass stole away the true definition of the pictures i wanted to remember. that is the unfortunate part of my visualizing saga, sometime i mar and twist my own memories into fantastic visages only seen in movies, and then find i cannot twist them back. sometimes i remember the waves at galveston quite a bit larger then they really were, the sun at the most vivid sunrise i recall that much brighter and golden, though taken from the special effects house and spliced with my memory. and i wonder which is better? to have the memory unaltered or to have the memory better, improved and refined into something so stunning to remember or think about that i might include it in stories. that's how i write, too. don't think out the story, i see though it were a movie flashing before my eyes, i hear it though a speaker were plugged next to me, i feel it though i were in it myself. sometimes i think about conquering the world, so much to the fact that i have it all planned out. i feel safe writing about here, because it is doubtful anyone will read this carefully or pay attention to it, but i am confident enough of my long-term plans that i would feel bad if someone didn't have the warning. maybe just fancy, but we will se won't we? if not, then i'll die a normal life, or maybe get a few books out and receive some fame, not as much as i'd like the money though. i'm sure i've met the twenty minute interval, but i forgot to check the clock so i'll keep writing a little longer to be sure to satisfy the requirement. so now i will daydream for sure, and write it as i see it, as though it were happening. no, i better not, it would probably appear too much like my writings, but i will go ahead and make-visualize a new landscapes like i did up there(earlier) because i enjoy it so much. i see a rising pyramid, sitting atop a four-cornered stone terrace that hold the point towards a sky with two suns, one burning bright and vaguely familiar to our own, the other a hazy blue color, lazily sitting near the point. surrounding it is the ruins of a city, not egyptian though, but more reminiscent of the roman culture, with tilted columns and ruble returning to the desert. the sand is a yellow with glitter, like mica flecks imbedded in the sand, which is hot tot he touch but not ruff, it runs like silk through the hands. my hands? i don't know, i just watch. the valley surrounding is windswept, though, perhaps they must be my hand because it appears quite desolate. the wind whips the sands into speeding wraiths across the amazingly flat area around, somehow no dunes develop, though. i wonder how that could be. i said valley, but i do not see any moutons or hills around. i wonder what prompted me to describe it as such. if i were writing a book, i would have changed it or added in a distant mountain line, but not so here. the sand seems compacted though, to the foot, though a hand can easily dislodge it, though it seems to flow back into place. it reminds me of the black sands of california, more gray then black, but equally as smooth and mica filled. perhaps that's where its glintiness comes from, a mixed memory of tv and actually physical things i've seen. sometimes its is, most times, though, it is merely illusion, merely contrivance, so i will let it go at that, ",1,1.422294 -0.921188 -1.661993 -1.373496 -1.735639 -1.549893 2.024432 1.753069 2.009527 4.34356 0.024962 0.639229 -0.931273 -2.022052 2.112899 0.0 -0.04277 -0.79854 -0.493789 -0.263829 -0.592032 -0.742368 -0.728953 0.989645 -0.624052 1.946577 0.59408 -0.64235 -1.218115 -0.734072 -0.83909 -0.155631 -0.956781 -0.906028 -0.807927 -0.551337 -0.068442 -0.66406 -0.24217 -0.287244 1.706451 0.431418 -0.97434 0.191628 1.076448 -0.557999 0.040338 -1.48897 -0.620174 -1.055571 -0.786079 -0.832091 -0.402248 -1.669796 -0.361153 -0.463971 -0.922279 -0.010036 0.055828 0.480904 -0.646312 -0.032066 -0.480161 -0.593204 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.174149 2.546747 0.088748 -0.23436 0.006991 -0.302507 0.220469 -0.163292 -0.914514 1.240591 0.391075 0.142938 4.059444 3.725829 4.226232 5.147561 5.907072,146
"every moment i am conscious of my physical self. it is like i have existed so long strictly within my mind that i have never really felt the sun touch my skin. i suppose i am excruciatingly aware of my body now that i realized i actually have one. lately it feels like i am rediscovering the familiar. i have always walked down the street. but never been aware of things like others faces, the noise of traffic, the heat, the breeze, the color of the sky. i have always lived in this alternate universe. i see only enough of the physical world to avoid collisions. and i live in my head, in my thoughts, in my music and art. i almost never come out. but lately i have opened my physical eyes. some of the things i have seen are things i could have done without. i'm not so sure i like it out here with the other people. i feel myself retreating again. i feel that small talk is a waste of breath. any words outside my poetic code are words wasted. any utterance that is not a song is a waste of voice. and i am trying to figure out why people need people. i have lived inside myself for a long time. i can make it through the monotony of every day life (hint: that's where the acting minor comes in). but maybe it would be more lucrative to just live down in here. and i wonder what is really ""being productive"". my mother said that i wasted my summer by being in love with someone who ended up not loving me in return. i feel that love is not a waste of time. if it is then what real purpose or function do we have in this bleak world. of course, now with my heart blown away i feel a bit sad. but i meant it when i gave my love to this boy. i meant every word, every breath, every touch. and i guess that my time wasn't wasted. his was. his time was wasted because he remained too long with someone he did not love. my time was not wasted. and now. let me push all memories of this love deep down into the corners of my soul. right now this grain of sand irratating every pore in my body. but maybe a pearl will result. a song. a painting. blah. blah. maybe i can once again transform the pain in my life into something pur-tee. man, someday all of this shit that i have passed off and forgotten through my art and songs is going to resurface and say ""hey! we are still here. "" and that is going to break me and finally i will no longer have creativity to turn to because i won't trust it anymore. gee. something to look forward to. and this girl came up to me today on the first day of classes. she said i looked ""alone"" and invited me to her church where ""everyone is a family and god is clearly present"". funny that she noticed i was alone and i didn't. i wanted to tell her that i would never fit into her christian bubble world. oh yeah, i live in a bubble world myself all right. but its a different kind altogether. maybe i should invite her for a visit in my bubble world. but. heh. i meakly gave her my number. i was in a way touched by her gesture and even though i oppose religion. who knows? i may go just to laugh at the sheep and. well. meditate. and plus. it would probably light up this nice girl's life. aww. it would also be cool to go someplace and have everyone be really happy to see you. i wonder if it would be wrong for me to go in order to reap these benefits. especially since there is no chance in my conforming to a religion. hmm. it seems like i have been given the opportunity to explore some areas of my life that i have suppressed in the past. certain tendencies. i guess i am really scared when it comes to this. i am afraid maybe of what i might find out if i try it. i mean. i have finally admitted to myself that these thoughts are frequent and substancial. but i don't want the course of my life to change that drastically. right now i long for both but am happy with one. if i try the other and realize that it is so much better than the other and begin wanting only it then i will have to do some major changes in my life and identity. but it might not be good. or i might continue liking both equally. which could also cause problems. sheesh.

" i don't understand many of the girls on my hall. they are all so immature and obnoxious. i want to meet mew people but i have a hard time giving any of these girls a real chance. i miss my little sisters and worry about them. my mother worries a lot about all of the things they may get into that are bad for them. i kind of screwed things up for them. i shouldn't have gotten into so much trouble in high school. it was fun though. i am so far away from anything i am familiar with. i have been away from home many times and it does not bother me. i did not realize being in school would disruot my comfort zone in the way that it has. i want to experience austin but have no on to experience it with and am afraid to go out alone, especially at night. i feel full and i love ice cream. i am very tierd for no reason at all. i am worried that i will not be able to find some really good friends. i am excited. i got a really good wristband for the ou game. hell yeah!!! i went to dinner with one of my neighbors tonight and i just know everything she said to me was a total crock of shit. i don't understand why people lie like that, maybe she is an obssessive compulsive liar. i hate computers, i hate how the entire system of life is now dominated by them. they are just machines, not people. american's are so detatched. september eleventh is tomorrow. the last stream of conciousness i did was about jimmy buffet and peeps. i love peeps. why do they only make them at easter. just like egg nog at christmas. you can only have egg nog at christmas though. it's like an overload of egg nog if you have a lot of it. moderation is important. my roomie is nothing like me. how in the hell did we end up living together. it's because my mom altered my questionaire. the lack of freedom!!!!! i think it is awful that they put animals into zoos. that should be illegal. they could have rehab clinics for the ones that they rescue but they shouldnt make their mony off of people coming in to look at them. i talked to a guy that was a comp something or other major and when i asked him what that was he said he didn't know!! how can you not know what your major is??? that is just wrong. i think he was just messing with me. i went to ground zero, it really impacted me in a different way. i never know if i am ding stream of conciousness writing the right way. there is no right way though. i hate computers. typing was invented by the devil. the home keys??? i just hate them. music is so important to us. i wish i had a larger vocabulary. why do people use people? i only have a little bit left. when i work out only 10 seconds or a single repetition can last forever. i guess i'm feelin' alright. it's all going to be good in the end.

"right now i am feeling good because today is friday. so far i have really enjoyed my first week of school. i like all my classes so far, and i am embracing the whole college experience. i am also happy because i am going home to houston today. it has only been a week since i left but i already miss my house and especially my parents. right actually i do not have anything on my mind. i am pretty tired because i slept late last night and had a fairly early class. in fact, right now sleep would be really good. well my stomach is also talking to me so i am also hungry. i have not eaten yet today. i am actually eating less in college since i seem to be always busy and always on the run. i like it though because maybe then i can lose some weight. another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. i never was really into computers in high school and now in college i have to constantly use it. i wish i was better with computers because i really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. i think the reason why i do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. i cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what i really want. for example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason i could not get into the website. however, i am glad i am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. i think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that i am rambling and to be honest i do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. i am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. my brain is just telling me to think of something to write. actually i am also anticipating for the time to be up. twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. i am finally done.

"well it's hard to pinpoint my first thought as i begin to write, as it would be hard to pinpoint one thought that i have at any one time. i think constantly, usually about things that i should or shouldn't be doing at that time. for example, i constantly think about things i should be doing to help myself apply for medical school, like joining organizations, volunteering at hospitals, or studying to have that 3. 6 or higher. it seems like i'm always on the go now. this summer was pretty leisurely and then i move down here and i try to work the same hours taking 12 hours instead of 3. it's not the best thing for the soul. speaking of soul, i try to go to church when i can and i feel guilty when i don't, but i haven't found the chance to go yet. and i hate making excuses, but i do a lot. i just watched a tv show on mtv called austin city or something like that. it really excited me because i'm from a really small town, which i don't think ever makes the news. i have been really impressed with ut and austin so far. all my professors have been great and i can learn from their lectures. i went to north texas for two years, where i had to learn most things on my own. i transferred with express and it is a lot harder down here. the manager is a lot stricter; i can't lean! i'm going to cut my hair off this friday, but i don't know if i should. but, on the other hand, my hair causes me to get really hot and sweaty. i have already made the appointment, so i guess i will go through with it. i can't imagine how boring this must be for y'all to read, but i guess it could get pretty interesting depending on the students i guess you can tell how confused i am all the time. it shows in my writing how often my thoughts conflict one right after the other. writing this hasn't taught me that though, i already knew i was confused.

"at the moment, i am tired. i just woke up a little while ago, and i'm writing. i can't stand writing. i don't mind the work. it's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. i was wondering the other day, if college was reall going to change me into the genius i expect to be. i mean, when i get out into the career world, will i know ""everything"" i need to know about my job? will i have to know everything? will there be room for training and learning? confusion! i guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. i guess what i'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. as i sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, i can't help but realize how much i miss my family back home. although college is my main priority and the fact that i don't care what anyone thinks about me, i can't help but wonder if my family thinks i can make it or not, if i have what it takes. that is always in my mind somewhere. i, myself, know i can make it. i know i have what it takes to succeed. however, when i do graduate and get a career job, is that it? is that going to be my life until i retire. i am very spontaneous and i won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. i stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and i read the assignment again. i have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. i'm not a scientist and i don't care to be. i just want to be happy.

"today was pretty interesting. for a monday. i only had two classes (calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor mr. pennebaker, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). do i get an a? anyway, my friend and i are waiting until about 11 pm so we can go to blockbuster to buy ""titanic. "" yes, we're crazy girls. blockbuster is actually having a small titanic party to celebrate its release. phenonenal, huh? i think so. wow, only four minutes have gone by. i guess i type too fast. i w i l l s l o w d o w n. my roommate just asked me if i would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. random question, huh?! i told her ""no. "" she is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. it grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. i think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. i am. how many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff? now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. it does bother me that she thinks she will ""turn into"" a lesbian without her consent. is that even possible? i don't think it is. some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. i don't know. i wish i did, but i don't. i guess i'll just have to see what happens.

"well, i am now officially writing my first college paper"" more or less. it is really hot outside today. i wonder when it is going to cool of so i won't swear so bad when i walk to class. i think that i need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when i get them, instead of putting them off. it makes me feel like i am bogged down when i have a lot of stuff to do at once. it is actually really stressful. i kind of like this song that is on the radio. busta rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper, but i think that this song is ok. pharrell really makes this song what it is. now come to think of it. i don't think that busta rhymes sang that song. oh well i guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes, so i won't correct my mistake. my chair is pretty comfortable. hopefully i will do my homework in it when i am done with this writing assignment. the longhorns really kicked new mexico state's butt. i think that chance mock (the quarterback) got to a ruff start, but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the longhorn's quarterback. although vincent young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal, scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts, and throwing a great 60 yard pass, i believe that mock should continue to start as qb because he has put in his time as scout team player. my, that was a really long sentence. i am tired of eating the food at the jester food court. they have a big selection, but the selections never change at each station. i kinda miss my mom's home cooking. i can get over that. i was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus, but i guess that i didn't think that i would see so many people going to class everyday. i kind of feel like a minority in austin. coming from a small town in east texas that is mostly white, black, and mexican, i am not used to seeing so many asian students. i am not against asian people at all, i just have never seen so many at one setting such as ut. the temperature in my dorm is not to my liking. i am a very hot natured person, and i prefer that it be cold in my room. being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling. i dislike sweating when i sleep. i need to go to the gym today. i am getting out of my routine of working out each day. i need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play. it is kind of hard to be disciplined once you don't have your parents to tell you what to do. the experience at ut is a good one though and i am not complaining. the only thing i dislike about it right now is that i still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks. the co-op did not have my mis book today like that re-order said. nothing is ever perfect. that is not a bad thing though. i hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy czar. this is an easy grade. there are so many fine girls here at ut. everywhere you look you see a hottie. i love that. some of them seem fake to me though, but i know that i shouldn't judge people. my phone is ringing and i am almost done. alright i am done. later.

"i am wondering whether or not i should try out for the dance team. in away i want to so i will have something to be a part of but at the same time i'm fearing the inevitable rejection. rather than be rejected i'm just not going to try but then i'll always wonder whether or not i could have made it if i had tried. if i do try out and then i fail everybody will know that i failed and i'll be embarrassed. i risked failure when i pledged but i did it anyway. my neighbor failed and i didn't think any less of her so why should i think any less of myself. i'll look fat in the leotard and tights, but one reason i want to do it is so i'll stay in shape. everything is too competitive. i wonder what my cats doing since when you gave this assignment you mentioned a dos so i started to think about my cat. then the picture frame i got today since i have a picture of my cat but i have to get another frame for my cat picture. my entire room is decorated in cat things. i found a gecko in my room today. there not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when i lived in arizona. they used to be at least a foot long. i wonder what i'm going to do tomorrow i have reading to do in the morning. i can't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods. my mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check, how stupid. that what you get for having an english teacher for a mother. i want to get a calendar to put up all my things. i'm scared to death i'll miss something like a homework assignment or test. i wonder if i need to be studying more often. it seems like i'm not doing enough. i don't know what i'll do if i fail. i hope i'm doing this write. it seems like the paper is just going on and on and on. i seem to worry about failure alot. i hate typing, i never memorized where the keys were so i keep goofing. my parents always told me to take typing but i was too lazy and afraid i was going to not get an a. i wonder how my sister got involved, society of women engineers. i say a bent today on the way to class. the other graduate students are coming on the 19 here. i bet it would be easier if i didn't repeat to myself what i was typing i need to go by the newman center to meet n9ice boys. why bother i never going to get married i probably not even going to get good grades and i'll never get in to med school and i'm going to flunk out. god i hope not or i'll end up as a house wife not that that's bad but i always wanted a career and my sisters so successful. my parents would be so disappointed. now i'm starting to sound negative like that survey said but i was much more optimistic in the survey i wonder if those ever prove anything or if people really lie to themselves when they're doing those even though they think they're being realistic this girl beside me took forever doing the survey. how much time do i have left? is anybody even ever going to read this? probably that was why it was done on the internet that reminds me of the guy i sat next to in chem. i hope he doesn't think that i was offended by his remark it doesn't bother me i'm used to it with adam and all. i feel like i've typed forever and it looks like nothing on this sheet the way it goes to infinity on the right. i keep on thinking about what to type instead of just typing what i'm think i just its just a habit from writing so many in class essays and such i'm so happy i passed the ap that way i don't have to take any english classes and i showed mr. cody and my mother i wonder what patrick's doing. he got a 5. the girl at dinner the other night was so stupid she thought she got a 560 and the sat's and the ap's were the same thing that's why i'm not a pom that and the fact i'm not talented enough since i spent a lot of high school studying instead of dancing or anything else. i can't imagine having three hours of practice a day. i guess i had as much with games and all but it seems like a lot less. i had a ton of fun at games though and wouldn't have given it up for it now. that's how i tell whether or not it was worth it if i would trade it for something else now not that i could go back and repeat it so i guess it doesn't matter anyway.

" i feel tired and sleepy. i feel that i just want to go to sleep right now. i feel this assignment is making me sleepier. i also feel pain in my stomach and want to do something about it. i feel that i just want to get up go to sleep. i feel that this assignment is boring and really unnecessary. i feel like my stomach is going to explode. i also feel a little stress because of all the things that i want to accomplish today with the little time to do it. i feel that this assignment is never going to end and that my thoughts are just blank right now. i want to get up and go do the things that are really important. my body aches from moving around too much. my stomach still feels like it's going to explode and i can't do anything about it. i'm thinking that i want to call my sister see how everything is going. i talked to her yesterday and it made feel good because i have been feeling kind of homesick and depressed. she is like my life advisor because she is always helping me out with stuff. i feel like i've through a whole semester of school work and i just want to take a vacation and relax and play basketball all day long. playing basketball is the only thing lately that makes feel good. i play a lot but i get tired quick so i can't always play to my full potential. sometimes i just don't want to do anything else during the day so i could just play basketball i work on my game. i wish that i could play all day long and never have to worry about anything else. right now i'm thinking if the major i chose is the right one for me. i don't know if i'm cut out for business. sometimes i feel like i want to devote my time to writing screenplays and playing basketball. i feel like the whole world is holding me back from doing so. sometimes i feel like doing something drastic and just drop out of school and live in southern california, a place that i absolutely love. i also wish i could transfer out of here. i never really wanted to be here. there's too many people with far different attitudes and goals than mine. i wish i was attending college in the northeast, but i would only pursue that if i were sure what i want my major to be. i don't a like a whole lot of things here now that i think about it. i was hoping my attitude about this stupid school would change once i got here but it hasn't. i knew i was going to feel depressed when i came here and that's exactly how i feel. things are moving too slow and i want them to move fast. i'm impatient right now because i feel i have been patient for too long. having an anti-social, computer nerd for a roommate doesn't help much either. his attitude and introvertedness sometime irritates me. i wish i had a different roommate. i feel that school screwed me with this. now i feel that i really wish that i could transfer. i just want to be in a better environment, hopefully somewhere i could find people like me.

"so this is the first entry, and it happens to fall on a day when things are really. shitty. i don't know if i have the desire to join the rowing team, though i've already told everyone that i was going to; my internet connection was messing with my earlier, a reason to cry in itself; my relationship with a boy i don't know enough about. lets start with that. i've been dating him for about a year and a half, and i don't know who he is. will he cheat on me? is my relationship anything to be worried about? if a stranger looked into our lives, would he giggle, surprised at the immaturity of our relationship? is it anything to try to save? i hope so, if not i'm a fool. but i think i'm one anyway. but paul henry, he knows his shit, it seems. or its that he knows that he doesn't know his shit. i wish i knew. i wish i knew him as well. though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me. i have nothing against christians or their beliefs. i wish i could give myself up to that with no regrets. but i can't. i've been down that road, and its lead nowhere. have i spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian? will i ever be content in my own two damn shoes? will i ever feel like i'm at home? will i be successful? would i be happy without success? it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect, even the less desireable, that there's some author out there, other than someones god, writing the stories of our lives. but he forgot me? why am i not going anywhere, why can't i find this happiness and joy. my life is pathetic at this point. maybe its just this horrible attitude, but the only time i feel like i can be happy (or at least not pissed off) is with brian, laying in his bed, thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time. but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements?? it would seem that i am happy with him, but then comes the doubt and fears. i need to find myself, i say. only thing is. i don't know what that means. does anyone? its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds. a state you need to obtain, but its in fact unattainable. the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they don't know how to go about it, and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them, so they can suffer justly. i wish i were born in the old days, when you died of a flu and there wasn't such a thing as aids. people lived lightly, they wrote, they read, sometimes found something to revolutionize, but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life. where did that virtue go? how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time, and where would it have gone? i wish i could sift through the ashes of our charred world, seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere, but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it. how come i can't be a writer? how come i can't write? i want to study people, not medicine. why would i declare this major? if i studied other peoples lives all the time, would i have a life of my own? is true adulthood worth it? people always want what they can't get. i get what i don't want. everything always seems like it gets really good, i mean reaaaally good, right when its about to end. will college be like this? will life itself be like this? will i stop asking so many damn questions?? will he call? would i want him to? i don't want this life. anyone want to trade? i want a life of the storybooks, of unquestionable love, faith and virtue. knowledge, hope, and an impeccable body would be nice too. i want all the money in the world, i want to live in a time without money. i want to be a movie critic, i hate bad actresses with hair that doesn't fit their character. i hate living with someone other than who i love. i hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about. i hate being inadequate, i hate second guessing everyone. i hate being critical. i hate chocolate chips. i hate gaining weight. i hate stretchy jeans that don't look good. i hate running out of time, i hate trying to fill time. i hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself, although i'm not sure why it would. seven six five four three two one.

"a steam of cousiness paper is kind of a weird thing to do, but in a way simple. at the moment all i can do is think about this paper and the impression i am going to make by putting down what i have to say. will i sound smart, dumb, or am i completely doing the wrong thing. oh well i guess there is not to much i can do about it now. i almost waited until the last minute to do this and i was afraid that the system might be backed up or something, just like the prescreening survey. wow!!! i waited until the last minute to do that and i was sitting at me computer for just about 4 hours. i guess that proves i procrastinate pretty often. sometimes when events like this happen i try to fix the problem and i do good for awhile. for example i won't but things aside and and do things sooner than later, but after about a week, i am back to my old habits. today i actually got stuff accomplished, but then ageing i didn't because, here i am a couple of hours before this assignment is due, trying to complete it. i am hoping that my internet connection won't crash or some other phenomenon, such as bad weather, won't affect me turning in this assignment. thing of bad weather made me thing of all the unfortunate events that have happened due to the hurricanes in the florida area. bad weather, such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, is something that really frightens me. i think it is really a big fear of mine. when i hear that a tornado might be in the area, automatically, i thing the worst and am afraid for my life. i guess i just wouldn't want to go that way. although its not a popular way to die, like cancer or drunk driving, its just scary to thing about. but after all the destruction in florida there haven't been to many deaths reported, a lot more than there should have been. this is a very serious topic and never thought it would take me to this. i just hope the situation clears up soon and the areas recover as soon as possible. recovery can sometime be the hardest thing to cope with and get through and that goes with any kind of recovery. such as when you get in a wreck and have to recover from that or even recovery from a long night of partying and drinking. that requires a different type of recovery. my fr ",0,1.310421 -2.268912 -0.163483 -2.409779 -2.165528 -0.75734 1.035997 0.915225 1.60802 -0.882018 -0.106824 -0.590446 0.723133 -0.564517 0.609425 0.0 -0.04277 -2.075972 -0.780815 -0.795527 -1.038049 -0.385645 -1.466104 -0.66774 -0.624052 1.796568 1.169814 -0.814514 1.123697 0.231919 -1.100231 1.739539 1.15866 1.653971 -0.147691 -1.109326 -1.442311 -1.204422 -1.825351 -0.595683 1.586197 2.248494 0.194465 -1.482912 -1.429535 -0.318677 -1.093488 -2.145342 -1.15603 -1.77425 -1.34699 1.154069 0.094449 -0.468777 0.258168 -0.672216 -1.29406 0.023839 0.832689 1.635262 -0.264891 -0.207855 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.079588 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.552021 0.855505 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.492747 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.852989 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.429287 4.174347 4.235705 4.439477 4.660459 5.037513,2240
"for instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd of students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. in addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because i live off campus. i attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems i haven't established any new friendships yet. however, i will continue my efforts throughout the semester. furthermore, i have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework i have been assigned each evening. it is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. i have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles i encounter. i have dreamed of earning my degree at the university of texas since i was a small child. as i grew into a young adult, i never let go of my aspiration to attend the university. my unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. i will accomplish my goals and i will prove to myself and family i can do anything that i put my mind to. when i get discouraged, i refer to the scripture, ""i can do all things through christ who strengthens me. "" i know i can succeed at the university of texas with my sincere desire and strong determination.

" usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""how am i going to do it? where do i start? where do i finish? how do i know that i am doing it right?"" this is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. i can't wait till saturday because i will attend the first ut football game this season, which i might add, will be my first time to attend one. the weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when i was up here for summer school. its a real drag. i'm always so tired i hate it. labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. maybe i'll go visit brett (an el paso friend) at the hidious a & m, college station, the drive is a drag though. the road trip that me and lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. all they're concerned about is putting ut down or ""tu"" as they call us since we're not ""the"" university of texas but ""a"" texas university! isn't it stupid. still admit i'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. they do have a lot of school spirit. makes me wish that i was into that stuff. who knows, maybe when all the football games start. i want to see how crazy us longhorns really get. i can't wait till softball games start, i want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!! hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, i will be ready to try out. i'm really discouraged about trying out this year, i know i'm not ready. my family's encouragement helps but i don't want to make a fool out of myself. i can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a ut uniform. how amazing. that is my goal!! if i can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't i have a shot on the team. i just think that i lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. it may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. i love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. i love it. there are a lot more responsibilities though, but i'm picking up on the time management. the incubus concert is coming up and i'm (since yesterday) going. i've only heard a few songs by them so i can't say that i'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. but hey i'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. i should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. its worth the experience.

" okay, so i am in my dorm room alone. i'm mostly thinking about how great my day was. i haven't had a day this good in a long time. even though i had to wake up early i was rewarded by my cotton bowl tickets which makes me happy, because i never win anything so it's really cool for me that i was the one who drew the best number. maybe my luck is finally coming in. i hope so. in addition to the tickets i got to see the guy who i am totally in love with twice today which was simply a gift from god because i hadn't seen him in a long time. when i started to pray for him i got to see him on tuesday, then when i started thinking about him even more, i got to see him twice, and he even spoke to me. i just wonder what he thinks about me. i doubt that he is thinking of me right now, but when he sees me, i wonder what goes through his head. i've never had a guy be truely interested in me before, so i hope that now that i'm in college, my luck will change. judging from my lucky number with the ou tickets, it looks like my luck is changing, but i can't say that it was just luck, because my rededicating my life to the lord contributed to my current happness in a big way. actually he is the entire reason why i am feeling the happiest i have since i have moved here. i have made good friends and i get to see joe. i just hope that i get to experience this feeling for a long time. i really am so happy, when i was walking down the street people were looking at me like i was crazy because i had this huge smile on my face. being a good person and having faith can get you anywhere that you want to be in life, and now that i have accepted that i feel a little more at ease. just a little though, i still worry about my classes. i just really want to do well. i need to catch up on my readings, which i will do this weekend. i just have to make myself. i also need to get my spiral back from meredith. it really pisses me off that she borrowed my notes, and hasn't given them back yet. that is really rude and inconciderant! it's okay though, becuse now i am thinking about joe again, so i am happy. i can't believe how happy it makes me just to think about him. i know i seem crazy because i barely even know him, but there is something about the fact that he makes eye contact with me, and that he is the only guy to ever speak to me on this campus. it just says something about him and about the way that he sees me, at least that's what i think. i just really want to fall in love. i look around and see all of these couples, and watch romantic movies, and listen to love songs, i want it so bad, that i can feel it! something in my gut tells me that joe is going to be my first real love, and even if it doesn't work out in the end and i get my heart broken, i feel like i'm ready. ready to experience something.

"i have too much homework to do. it is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours. the homework in ut requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time. also, at ut, you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management. also, there are a lot of distractions like girls, basketball, sleep, etc. going to early classes has been hard for me so far. it is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it. i think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about, or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand. this is because once you are lost, you really don't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed. i really think that my gpa is important this semester becuase i am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science. this is becuase i do not like computer science which is my current major, and business seems easier and a better track to go. today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection. it kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student's number really was. i want my parents to bring me a bike to ut. it is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes. but i kind of don't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair, you will have to pedal over hills, and cars don't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians. i am kind of pissed that the school is closing gregory gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party. i think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night. plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too. i really think that the ut football team is going to do well this year. although they blew a big first game, i think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year. i don't understand why chris simms chose to come to texas over tennessee. he is such a good quarterback to be a backup. i think he should be starting over major applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic. i really don't like to do these things because it takes so much time. when i first started typing i didn't realize how long 20 minutes is, but it is a long time. when i finish this, i need to start on my english paper, and do my calculus problems. my calculus ta is really stupid because she cannot teach us. she skips too many steps, and she can't explain problems very well. i think that radio stations should not have morning shows. this is because i was listening to a radio station in the morning that didn't use to have a morning show because they were new, but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music. also, they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to. i like it when it rains. but here in austin is never seems to rain. i've been here for 2 1'2 weeks now and not a drop of rain. when it rains i feel better for some reason. tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because i don't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon. and all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you don't learn anything. i like a girl here are ut but i don't know if she likes me back. but i am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to emory in atlanta. the girl that i like in ut though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that i am there. she also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous. the girl in emory is a girl that i've known for 4 years and i think i stand a better chance with her, but i hear that long distance realtionships never work out.

"well, i'm not really sure what types of things i'm supposed to be saying. i miss my boyfriend so much. i hope he has a safe trip home. i hope he doesn't fall asleep. i feel really sleepy myself. i hope i can stay awake for this twenty minutes. time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. especially when school work is involved. i wish i was a better typer. it is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. people probably think i'm not a very interesting person. i try to be, but i think i was born to be boring. be boring and study my life away. i really don't mean to be so studious. i mean i want to do well in school, but i think i'm too caught up in it. everything makes me nervous. it is so strange because even though i know this isn't going to be ""graded"", i feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. i miss my family and my friends. i don't think i appreciated them enough when i was home. it is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. it took years to be so close to them, and now i have to start all over. i'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. i wonder if they miss me as much as i miss them. i'm so paranoid. i'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. what if they don't mean ""love"" in the same way that i do? i hate being hurt. i like to be in control and be omniscient. i like to have the upper hand with people. unfortunately, i think most of the time i'm the vulnerable one. is that normal? probably. if i tell myself that enough i might believe it. could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. so many songs make that claim. it must be a truly amazing love. i am still in awe when i think about what jesus did for me and everyone else. he died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. what love! how sad though to think that not everyone accepts it! i feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. i feel like there is something i could say to solve it, but i just don't know what. i know i'm not doing everything i could for christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. i know i can't be perfect, but i try so hard to be. it feels that i come up short a lot in my life. it is so stressful. i'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. i can't stop though. kale is so wonderful. he would do anything for me. i can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. my parents have to, but he doesn't. it is amazing.

"it is really bright in here. maybe i should turn on of the lights off. i would except i'm writing a stream of consciousness. i really miss byron. i just talked to him about 10 minutes ago, but i need to talk to him again. boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. haha. i still haven't paid mom for last months bill. i probably should have read chapter 3 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 12th, but i would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if i hadn't gotten this over now. whoops. my poster looks like it is about to fall down. oh well, i'm to tired to go and put it back up. yet, i am still awake enough to sit here and type for 20 minutes. i wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. and i wonder if they read every one of these. especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. man, if i were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. and if i wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. haha. instead of spelling i accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. i wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. i'm so glad i finished that photo wall. it turned out really nice, but stephanie didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as i did to put up. oh well, that's her problem. man, my dvd's are really out of order. i'm not sure why i think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. you know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while i was in the middle of this, and i would have to start all over again. then i would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. oh well, this is for science i guess. man i really really miss byron. i can't believe i got so upset today when i was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. i don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. at least he is nice i guess. i wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. i guess that really isn't my business, but i'm just so damn curious. byron didn't seem to know, so i guess i'll never find out unless i ask him, and i don't know him quite well enough to do that. man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. i don't think i've written for 8 minutes straight before without taking a break. i hope my calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, i did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet i still remain cynical. i guess i'll just go over the homework problems again before i go to sleep. i can't wait until that royal's show comes on a and e. wow, i was so lazy i didn't even bother to find the and symbol. haha. i did it again. if i wasn't on this laptop i wouldn't have a problem finding it. i wish it came with a 10 key pad. byron. byron. i can't stop thinking about that boy. he is such a sweet heart, and i can't wait to finish college so i can spend all my time with him. i wonder where a & e is. haha. i found the & symbol. i wonder if there is some way that i can find out the channels on the internet through ut's website. man this is a hell of a lot of typing. hey hey, i see my monkees bobble heads. they are so strangely entertaining. that's the only reason why i'm going to watch the a&e special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). that, and because byron said he was going to watch it. there's the picture i have of us! i can't stop looking at it or thinking about him! i'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who byron is (though it's pretty obvious). i hope archie allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and i don't have to drive back to san antonio again. i don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have byron visit up here. i'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. there are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though i trust his driving abilities. i think i'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so i know that he is alright. ya, that's a good idea. i should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but i don't want to get up and find it, nor am i suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. man, steph drank all my hi-c. or did i drink it all? naw. steph did. i distinctly remember having at least 2 left in there when i left on thursday. i don't drink her stuff. oh wait, i did but she told me i could have some. man, that whip cream i got on my face earlier from the frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. i can still smell it. eww. it smells like babies vomit. byron! why aren't you here with me right now! i know why you aren't here, but i wish you were! someday i won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture! especially since i am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal! all the thought i have in-between are meaningless because i don't consciously notice them, but when i'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention! i should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but i can't stop. it isn't like i don't mind these ideas, i just know that i won't be paying attention to what i should be. hurray i'm almost out of time. 19 minutes. and a few seconds. steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. what is up with this. i'm not going to clean up after her. i'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can i do. i love you byron! i want to drive up there right now but i can't because of class!

"wow! time goes by fast. here i am doing my college homework and it seems as though just the other day i was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in college. time flies and friends come and go. i have met so many people since i have been at this enormous school. i have come to realize that you must take initiative in order to succeed. for instance, i am currently majoring in theatre, but i don't know if that's what i really want to do with my life. if i don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far i can go, i will never figure out if theatre is the way i want to go or not. then there's the question of what i'd do if i didn't major in theatre. i know that i wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time i've had to write this since i have had many computer troubles. i accidently erased the first one and my friend's computer froze when i was writing the other one. i am using my friend robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. right now i'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ut, and they're talking about ross's hair. some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he doesn't want his hair cut. they think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs to differ. anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. i just remembered that i have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my room. i hope it's not stale. maybe i can drink it with my over-do milk. it's past the drinking date. this gum is very stale and i am getting hungry. if i were in my room, i would eat my muffin or the chips that i didn't eat last week because i had to get to class. you see, i feed the birds my second sandwich because i'm full. then i still have chips left over. oh, well. the joys of wednesday sack lunches from towers. i'm used to sack lunches because i've eaten a sack lunch every day in high school. the reason is that we eat in the greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. some of my friends have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers get mad. ah, the good old days. robert and ross and kristi want to order a pizza. that sounds like a good idea. it's late and i have to get up early for my intro to media class tomorrow. college is a time when it seems hard to get any sleep. there's always something you've got to do, or just good old fashioned procrastination. i mean, i don't procrastinate. this isn't even due for another week or so, and here i am, already typing it for the 3rd time. adam sandler is on tv right now. i just learned that his cds have a parental advisory due to explicit content. isn't that interesting. funny how society tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these days. like my friends. they're crazy. children are exposed to so much, like from tv. i never had cable growing up, so i don't know what it's like. we did have channel 13, kera. that was nice. now, we're listening to the doors, which reminds of a midsummer night's dream because my high school did it in the 60's and that was the music we used. well, at least, we used some doors music. we used great 60s music. then i was in a midsummer night's dream in the 90s, and we used original music written by one of the cast members. he wrote the tune for the wiz, and tranfered the words because of course shakespeare didn't write like the music in the wiz. robert just called a guy because his number was on a dollar bill. he's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. then there's ross with his mushroom haircut and kelly, who some say looks like tom cruise, but in reality, he looks nothing like tom cruise. no more than the pizza guy, who looks like a clown. i am afraid of clowns and i haven't even seen ""it. "" however, i did see a stephen king movie on new years a couple years ago with 2 girls from scotland. new's years day was 32 hours for me because i was traveling back from israel. that was a great trip. well, it's been 20 minutes and i feel like there's not much else needed to say.

"i am so happy to be home right now. college life is fun and all, but i miss the comforts of home. at the dorm, there is always something ""extremely important"" to do at every moment. someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. i have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. i am getting so overwhelmed by it all. i suddenly have so many responsibilities. like making sure i wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure i eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. and my current boy situation is so overwhelming. suddenly, no that i am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. they are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. it is so weird to not have a boyfriend since brandon and i were together for 14 months. to make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. i know that lots of girls feel the need to ""find themselves"" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before i actually was in their shoes. i mean, don't you know who you are? i thought that i did, but now that everything is so different, i feel very lost and confused about who i am and what types of values'morals i have. up to this point, every decision i made was affected to some degree by my parents. for example, my 1 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where i went at night, how much sleep i got each night. also, there were rules on who i went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. now, i can come and go as i please with no questions asked. i'm not so sure that is a good thing. i mean, just because i am 18, that does not mean i suddenly competent to run my entire life. i miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. although, i think that mom and i talk more now than when i lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. we talk almost five times a day. but it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when i am down. what is also so diffucult now is that when i need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. so, i am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that i have formed some sort of bond with. friendships are difficult and delicat things. i know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. they take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. you cannot just jump in and say ""oh we are best friends now. "" that is why soroity life is so strange now. i have been thrown into this new ""family"" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet i don't even know most of their names. i guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. however, i am thankful to have somewhere to go when i get lonely. which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone.

"it seems like everyone has gone home for labor day weekend. lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. we had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. i really don't normally like mashed potatoes but i always just get them anyway. a couple people started playing coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. the more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. this dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. at night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. they tend to yell and be extremely loud. our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. it would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. there are so many more months before the semester is over! i'm sure it will go quickly though. twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. i still have to go to wal-mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. i'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. i've been watching way too much of ""the real world"" in the past two days. they've been playing reruns nonstop since like wednesday. this week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because monday and wednesday are my busy days. i want to get out of the city next weekend. maybe i'll go visit some friends at texas state or go to the lake. i haven't been swimming in really long time. i remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than i remember swimming in my own pool. maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. the trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but i never once got stung. the lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because i'm over half way done. the game on saturday was really fun. once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. unt didn't do very well. i almost went there instead of ut just because its close to home and my sisters went there. on the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. i don't know why i bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when i have a computer sitting right in front of me. its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. i hear a lawnmower outside. i feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on labor day. my neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. i should trim my fingernails. they keep getting in the way while i'm typing. i haven't seem a movie since i came to austin. i don't even know where a movie theater is around here. better yet, i don't know what is playing right now. i haven't seen any previews either. someone must be sick because i keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. people go out way too much. i can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. i always want to wait for the weekend. i'm sure that will change shortly though. this has been a very long weekend. i think i'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.

"why can i not think of anything to type the moment when i click the start link? this is so weird, i just hungry everytime after i am done showering. why is that? is it because while i am showering my body also takes the food away from my stomach? i wonder why my feet are so smelly even though i have already taken a shower. my roommate seems to be busy all the time and never seem to have any time to chill or hang out with me and some other people. i think that guy in the spe meeting today was pretty cute. hopefully i will be able to meet him sometime. wow, it is getting pretty late right now and i am getting a little bit sleepy. i took the pretesting for the psychology required experiment testing and it was really long! it was so detailed that i was about to give up and continue it some other time and go to sleep instead. man, i really don't know what to do about calculus. i seem to be struggling in all of my math classes and if i still don't get help by next monday, i will be screwed. i feel kind of floaty? is that the word to describe it? my feet are really cold right now, i wonder why. my hands are a little cold too. hmm. i think it's because that the temperature in this room is getting lower and lower. i really want the temperature to go up a little more if not it's going to be freezing in here like my other friends' dorms at jester west. man. i still have 3 more classes tomorrow but good thing that i don't have any classes on friday! yay! i think i am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be hard for me to find something that will match with it. if not, i can ask my sister if she wants to buy it from me or not. hopefully she would want it so then i wouldn't have to make a trip back to the mall to return it. i am feeling really tired and sleepy right now. i wish i can go to sleep but i have to get some work done before it will be too late. hopefully i will be able to go back to houston sometime this or next weekend. i really want to see my cute little brother! i miss him a lot! ouch, my right arm is aching now. i think it's because i have been using the computer too much and typing a lot. i think i really do need a break from the computer. where is he? i really want to talk to him but it seems like he is either always away or i talk to him and he never replies. that is really annoying. my contacts feel a kind of weird. i think i should take them out and put on my glasses instead. hmm. i really do wonder why my roommate has to leave that music on forever. is it because it soothes her from all of the pain and stress through out the day? that's probably the reason why. i really do wonder why she wants to be a vegetarian. i think it's quite interesting even though i really don't think i can live without eating any meat in my life. meat is just too good. i wonder why one of my friends today acted kind of strange. i think she probably felt bad for me for not being able to make it in time to eat dinner with me or it's probably because that she wants to find out something that has to do with either me or this other friend of mine. i think that it really annoys me a lot when she acts in this immature way and causes me to not be able to trust her even more. a few of my friends on aim are messaging me and i am trying to reply to them even though i am concentrating on typing this up. she was asking me about whether i will be going to the next football game or not. should i go? but i think that the tickets is going to be rather expensive but going to one wouldn't be that bad since i have never gone to one before. man. it's only been a few days of my first classes in college and i am gradually starting to hate it. why do college math professors just scribble random things on the board? i mean can they at least have a little bit more organization? it makes me so confused on understanding the material and i can't even figure out how to solve the homework problems. i wish i can change my calc professor but i think that is going to be impossible. ouch, both of my arms hurt now, i think i should be getting off the computer really soon. an individual sports package? what is that? for 40 dollars? i really don't know if i should get it because i don't really want to spend all of my money on football tickets. all right, i think my time is almost up and i am so happy i can go to sleep now!

"i'm in my boyfriends apartment and my friends and i are doing our laundry. i feel very tired since i have an 8:00am class. i've had a pretty good day though, i love ut. my classes seem okay and i'm sure i'll do fine. i don't feel at all homesick, which is good. my parents miss me so much though and i feel bad for that. i'm going home this weekend even though i don't want to, but that's okay. i don't think i'm doing this right. no one will probably ever read this so why should i care. i feel like such a number at this school, but i am determined to change that. i feel like i'm writing in my journal. emily and annie are over here too and they brought their homework. i wish i had brought mine. i am so afraid that i'm going to get behind in my classes and not make good grades. i want a gpa of 3. 5 or better. maybe it was stupid to set a goal that high, but that's good for me because last year i could have done a lot better. i don't regret it though, i had a very nice senior year. this year i want to study very hard though and be able to say i tried my hardest. i also want to get a phd in psychology. i don't know why though because i just want to be a housewife. i love the idea of people calling me dr. hutchins though, that would be so cool. being a medical doctor is waht my heart desires, but i can't stand the sight of blood. that causes a problem. so, i figured i'd help people another way. if i do work i want to be a child psychologist. i have a passion for kids and want to help as many as i can. that's why i want to be a housewife, so i can be with my kids all day. i'm getting tired of typing now, it should have been 15 min, not 20. i wonder what other people are going to type about. my back is hurting from sitting like this so i'm going to stop. it's been 20 min anyway. i feel weird writing something for school and not using any kind of format, but i really enjoyed it because i hate english with a passion. i took two years of ap english and i didn't pass the ap test my junior year. didn't bother taking it my senior year. alright goodbye :) ",0,0.238752 0.462094 0.39507 0.719344 1.379844 -0.134166 -1.252638 -1.353368 -0.927204 -0.836578 -0.190828 -0.590446 0.38153 -0.306286 -0.77441 0.0 -0.04277 0.375872 1.772416 -0.438114 1.752056 -0.742368 -1.168792 -0.31847 2.596388 -0.302747 -1.729849 0.440949 1.329648 1.462892 2.059522 -0.916546 0.36045 -0.283057 -0.170846 0.578559 0.239464 1.063635 -1.396672 1.057966 -0.187033 -0.913514 0.134349 0.022602 -0.466937 -0.74838 1.650319 -1.22602 -1.173631 -1.534567 0.915311 -1.324032 -0.42646 -0.236989 0.523808 -2.385835 -1.316139 -0.954251 0.212514 -0.656785 0.668827 1.110334 -0.480161 1.706978 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.409016 0.04008 0.363056 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.391876 -0.451544 -0.005523 0.596761 5.407804 4.106941 4.742193 4.657309 4.394723,357
"why do i have this pimple? why does it matter what people look like so much? i am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. i am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their ""body"", because their new ""body"" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. i went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. my best friend and i had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. he has a girlfriend, and i just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. it was horrible. it was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially ""accepted"" you had to have a beer in your hand. now, one might think that would be an excuse, but i didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. for some reason, i want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. thanks. :o) well, it was so dumb. my best friend and i walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and i'm not all about that. i am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. it doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. i am more a people person. i like to make people laugh. i don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way i am. i have this quirkiness (thanks sooze) about me, but i love it. i don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because i am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when i had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. my whole life, i have been nice, and i go by the saying ""nice guys finish last"". i had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is ""nope"". i was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. okay, i know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. i hate using the word ugly, and i hate judging people. i don't. i always hear my friends going up, and saying ""aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"". okay, first of all, i am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. why? why does it matter what he looks like? why can't he be a nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. how he treats her. what he does for the world. what is up with this world? i never say that shit, because there is no reason for it. i hate saying ""oh, he is ugly"" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, i am not the best looking guy on campus, and i have no right in heck to say that. i hate hate when my friends say it. but, it's the world. college was supposed to be different. the time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. it hasn't quite been that, and granted, i have only been here for a couple of days, but i am scared. i am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. i mean, i go out and meet people, but i don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. we say when we leave ""see you around"", but have you realized the size of this campus. it's freakin' amazing. there are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. it was supposed to be different. i mean, don't get me wrong, i don't have 12 eyes, and i have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. i get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. it's not that i am looking at all, because i am in love with sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when i walk into a room, people stare. i promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, i would get those stares. thank you for your time.

"sometimes i think of what other people are thinking. i watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. they must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. i don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. i feel strange in the fact that i am putting my thoughts into words. though i am concentrating on writing, i am also able to let my mind wander while i write. the way i think and the way i process my thoughts has changed since i've been in college. leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which i desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that i have at home. my life in austin is good, but it is missing all those people that i made such a major part of my life. i wonder if those people will ever be there again. my family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. my friends and my boyfriend are the ones that i spent ever spare moment with. now that i am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. i always travel back in time, in my head, to the days i spent with them. every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times i had with them. maybe they are thinking the same way. i can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. my mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but i have yet to see what she is talking about. my mother is great. now i realize all the things she has done for me. she was always there for me, and even now that i am hundreds of miles away, she still there. i was distracted by the distant voices behind me. they seem to be discussing a project. some kind of stress has been put on this group. i am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. stress is one thing that i cannot deal with. when i stress i start to think a lot. when i think, i get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that i no longer can do the things i used to do in the past. some people beside me are also using the computer. their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that i am writing about them. if i were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. i can always feel someone looking at me. even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes i can see someone look. even when i don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. after this writing assignment is finished, i have to drive through austin's traffic to get home. that is the only thing i can't stand about going home. what should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. things like that frustrate me. the light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. i have a feeling that austin is going to be just like houston, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. it is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. after that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again.

"okay, my thoughts. a jumble right now, let's see if i can sort them out. my feelings are peaceful array, overwhelmed, giving god praise and glory for his awesomeness. i just looked at a person, just looked at his face, tried to figure out if he was good-looking or not and then punished myself for doing it because i have a guy, i need to stop looking at others. or do i, confusion is going on in there right now but also a peace or something that is covering over all of it. put there by god i know his truth will come out in time. i am suppressing something, a feeling i have a lot. suppressing emotions, bad things, allowing myself to think of something?? i don't know, is it a discipline to control the mind. deep down is that constant. god is there watching loving taking care of me, his will is at the center, my will fighting with his will, but another side of me so wanting him to take over and control my whole life. i am tired, but why? i slept in until 9:00a. m. today, i shouldn't be tired, i wonder if the sky and weather outside have anything to do with it?? a little bit down. i didn't hear from jeromed today yet. always that little doubt, is he given up? but i doubt but deep deep down i know ther is something there holding it so strong, or stopping me from worrying and getting taken over by it, a holding on so hard to god and knowing that what he has deemed right and true will come for i have given him my life to be in control of . why did that psychology test ask such dumb questions? i mean about sex and just assuming that everyone has had it and asking about it. i feel a little bit dirty considering and thinking about those different types of sex there are. i am pure, a virgin and i plan to stay that way until marriage. it is so sad, but those types of people must be rare in the world today, i have been secluded from the real world it seems, well kind-of, not too much. actually what is the real world. i'm thinking and holding onto the fact that actually the way god sees things is the real world. we can blind ourselves so easily to what is real and fake and what really does or doesn't matter. people care so much about nothing. things that won't last things that won't follow aor come with them after they die, now i'm getting bored with this subject but i want to finish it out. i so desire my roommates to come to know christ. i am worried about my witness and just as i live what i portray, today's society doesn't care about who or what you worship, oh it's all good , hey that's great you believe in this and she in that and i in this. how sad is that, the truth is god, but also people won't accept that unless god is there working , what does convince a person to become a christian or is that the right words to use, now onto camp, a picture of the campfire with boys all around it, the orange nice comforting mysterious warm flames in the middle of a set of logs and as i approach it down the steep hill i hear jabbering and talking and i see the beautiful red, orange, pink cloud overhead, how is that so beautiful? how do those colors come out? i don't know, but it is awesome! then i see the staff, jerome, susan, nicole (she most prevelently), holly, and others. then i sit next to jerome and my heart just warms up, i don't know what to say or where to look and i'm just glad i'm next to him, we can't touch, don't let the kids know that we are dating, it would be better if they didn't know about this, jerome had said, okay, with god's help i can behave myself. it's not that hard to make myself do something, good. we sit there and i just glance at him and his one yellow and blue eye and his other blue eye, how in the world did someone so handsome and with so much integrity and love come to want me and want to date me and care for me. i don't know, i have no idea about myself, it's just me and though, me , a continuous struggle and fight to let god rule and reign or me to take over. again how is christ going to shine. i don't want to change with god and though deep down he is there and it seems nothing will change that, but how do i know what will happen in the future? i don't, but the one person i do know and is always there is in the future now and knows. all-knowing, all-powerful, everywhere, god!! not myself, i can't ever be god i am so fallible and a sinner! only god! okay, just looked at the clock and actually i am enjoying this writing all my thoughts. at the beginning i was skeptical of this whole assignment. why should i focus on myself? anyway, it is fun to put into words my thoughts and interesting what i actually think about within 20 minutes. it seems a lot of jerome and of god and issues. these are my thougts for the last 20 minutes. hmmm! :) ",1,1.000409 -1.118881 -0.000433 -0.920559 -0.501938 -0.568396 -0.02296 0.271768 0.118743 1.102187 -0.097286 1.845701 -0.946808 0.06949 -0.337385 0.0 -0.04277 -0.55414 -0.830544 0.041405 -0.865139 -0.417132 -0.004088 -0.593056 0.884171 0.047374 0.464545 -0.577867 1.029856 1.711088 0.872837 0.977933 -0.347296 0.260991 -0.026142 -0.318842 0.783051 -0.022985 0.730673 -0.412532 2.152249 0.118651 -0.519943 0.81826 1.726148 -0.240722 0.405681 -0.320967 0.444145 -0.191985 0.242258 -0.780037 -0.822235 0.286813 0.085287 0.879572 -0.04336 1.275145 1.62797 1.194718 -0.870899 0.092384 5.198975 0.403223 -0.261269 0.631594 -0.086094 -1.005085 1.975229 0.130858 -0.23436 1.521255 0.416412 0.26472 -0.422267 0.073596 0.187707 -0.031067 0.549014 4.849995 3.31943 4.995223 4.444391 5.086731,751
"i completely forgot that i had a discussion group for philosophy today at 12, so i went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now i am awake. since i have been here i have never spent the night completely alone in our room. however, this weekend i have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to houston, one to dallas, and the other is always at her boyfriends. so this weekend i will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. i used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. but it will be weird to stay here alone, since i have been here all of three weeks. right now i am on the phone with the health center people, because i woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so i am about to go take care of that. it is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the ou game in a couple of weeks. about a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. however, the other morning when he came to pick up my id he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. when he depledged i had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. when he said he was back in it worried me. i think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. but we will see how that goes.

"this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio, texas. i went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell i'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. however, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished. i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order. at first when i went to the co-op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i didn't need about three of them. so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed, and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but i still managed to have a great time. i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home. i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. we went out to eat and to see a movie. we weren't sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. i can't wait for winter time. it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. one of the worst times i've ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and i smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. all together i would have to say that i'm very excited about this year, and i can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life.

"typing, what i feel, boy that is kind of odd. not to often do you get an assignment where you just write, write whatever you feel. what am feeling right about now. i mean, i just got back from my economics class, with mr. hammerhesh, or as he says the ""hammer. "" it was a crazy experience with some few hundred people crammed into his class. yesterday was an eye opening experience with one of my classes having 500 + people (yours, and then two of my teachers speak limited, and i do mean limited english. what a day, at good old university of texas. chris farley, i just thought of him, because i watched a dvd of his greatest hits. farley, to me is one of america's greatest comedians, because no matter what he was doing, he made the viewer laugh. truly an outstanding comedian, with a heart the size of texas. unfortunately like many other great hollywood actors, comedians, and musicians, he too became inundated with drugs and alcohol. like one of the characters he plays, matt foley, he played with life, and life came back to bite him, and instead of living in a van down by the river, he is living in a casket down by the prairie. so much to do, and so little time. with all these clubs an activities and class schedule, college seems like one big whirlwind. with only moments here and there to catch your breath, and sit down to relax. which organization should i join? so many options to accept, with so many good looking ones, but which ones to focus on. in high school, i did everything, and being in charge of a lot of them i was able to schedule each event around the other. but now, i am just another tadpole in the great lake. phones are ringing, but no one is singing in my crazy packed dorm room. the twenty minutes is running to end. you would have thought i would type more in twenty minutes, but since this whole streaming typing is new to me, i guess i did a good job. anyway, at least i did not copy a tv repair manual in this box and put it in. ;) well, it's on to lunch then on to many other fun classes, some immunizations, and a bike ride. but before i go, i would just like to say that apple computers are the greatest computers in the world. and, no i am not some sort of computer guru, i just think that apple computers are the easiest, coolest looking, and highest performing computers in the world. and, that my friend, is all i truly have to say. thank you, and please, have a good day.

"i've never done this before, but hey, whatever. college is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments i've had to do so far for classes. i don't really know what to say. i just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in san antonio. i miss her. and borrowing her clothes. i miss my little sister, too. it's funny because i didn't think i'd really miss my family and most of the time i don't, but the other night i just got this sporadic mental picture of my dad. it was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. it sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. such is growing up. so, no one's going to read this. that's pretty good because i'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. i love that word. i try and use it whenever i can. ha! this is crazy. actually, pennebaker's class is one of the best i have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. i only took it because this girl i know said she knew pennebaker's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. and he is. and he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. i mean, some of my professors are crazy. i have this one professor who barely speaks english, which is cool and all, but really, how can i learn from someone i can't understand? and the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, ""in asia. "" at least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and i've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. i don't get it. does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in asia? because that's what we're studying right now. bacteria. and it's not even interesting. i mean, who really cares about ers and lipids and lysosomes? well, i guess that's a pretty dumb question. of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. i personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. really, guy. but i have to take the class, whether i want to or not. i only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, i'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. ah, geology. my eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. after this, i have some serious catching up to do. and it's not because i miss my classes or anything. i mean, i don't even drink. except for wine, and that's really only when i eat out, which i do less and less these days. these dayswhat am i talking about?! i've been here for less than a month. it feels like i've always been here, though. which is weird. i love austin, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. seriously, they're nasty. and what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? they're not, most of them anyway. my neck hurts. that professor i was talking about earlier, the one who speaks english very poorly? he sings in class. right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. and it's not like he's singing to himself. i mean, he's wearing a mike. we can all hear him loud and clear. and the only song he knows how to sing is ""oh, what a beautiful morning. "" except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. he's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, i would never go to class. that's pretty weird of me, right?

"wow, i really don't know what to write. all i know is that i'm kinda behind on my studies. the bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of school. i know i shouldn't procrastinate like this, but i just can't seem to help it. that's why i'm doing this assignment at the last minute. bad, huh? hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. i just took a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. i have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. i really miss my boyfriend. the funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that i'm vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. well his father is black and his mom is half arabic and half french. my boyfriend, mohamed, was born in africa but moved to paris when he was only one years old. he's lived there for the past 18 years or so and have been here in the u. s for only two years. he speaks five different languages. pretty impressive, huh? i have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. i haven't seen him in two weeks. i miss him sooo much. i wonder if he misses me or not. what do you think? my problem is that i'm not calling him until he calls me first. that's just the way i am. the guy always has to make the first move. i guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. i really hope he will call soon. i really, really miss him. i guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. if my parents ever find out i'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely freak! that's how they are. actually, that's how i kinda was. i told myself i would never ever like anyone but asian guys. boy, was i wrong. you know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. for some reason, i'm sitting real straight up in my seat. i never do this when i'm just typing for the heck of it. maybe the fact that i know this is for a grade makes me a bit uneasy. oh well, i don't mind. there, i kinda sat back a bit and it feels a little bit better now. i just yawned. great, i need to stay up kinda late tonight to do some other homework. i have ten more minutes but i don't know what else to write. i guess i type kinda fast, and so it seems as though i'm writing a whole lot, huh? i don't know how you are going to grade this. i know it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. i bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh? no, i'm just kidding. . oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. i love you more than i can say. , i'll love you twice as much tomorrow, oh, oh, i love you more than i can say. oh, don't you know i need you so, oh tell me please, i gotta know. do you mean to make me cry? am i just another gal, that was just a song that i usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. how do you like it? it's kinda funny how sometimes i think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, i think i'm the ugliest troll. why is that? one day i would have complete confidence in myself and the next day i would feel so small and vulnerable. why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially asian guys. well, i kinda know the answer to that question. since i'm asian and i want to meet an asian guy, i tend to feel more self conscience when i'm around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. i've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. because i don't really see them as a potential romance interest, i am very relaxed and calm with them, and i guess we just click like that. i know i should do the same with asian guys, but it's hard just b'c they're asian, also. why is it so complicate, man? well, tomorrow, my friend cheryl and i are gonna take a bus to the mall. i've only been on the bus twice here around campus. i've never taken a bus on a highway before. i have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. wish me luck. man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! isn't that weird? okay, i'm gonna stop bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .

"my suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. i really should go to bed so i won't be tired in the morning, but i want to get this done so i don't have to worry about it later. the tag on my shirt itches. i need to cut it off. my suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. my roommate is studying still. someone just slammed a door down the hall. my suitemates are being loud again. my back kind of hurts. it must be from carrying my backpack around all day. i'm really tired. at least i don't have class until 10 in the morning. i'll get a little more sleep. i need to remember to go to the co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. i bet i'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. i should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. she asked me why i had to type for twenty minutes. i've only been typing for 5 minutes! my suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. my feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. i hope i do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. i studied all my notes and read the chapters. i'm getting sleepier, but i have to finish this. they're being loud again. they are loud a lot. i think the second night i was here, they came in at 4:30 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. me and my roommate are quiet. someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. i think it was dani, but it may have been amelia. i can't tell their voices apart yet. i think amelia is the one with a job at footlocker. my roommate is popping her knuckles. i pop mine a lot. i need to stop. everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. i don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. i just popped my knuckles out of habit. someone just slammed a door again. everyone always slams doors. maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. i only have five minutes left. that's good because i think my roommate is done studying for the evening. now she is typing on her computer and laughing. she must be iming someone. it is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in el paso, or maybe it is her friend louie that i met the other day. i wonder who's online that i can talk to right now. probably no one. i need to go to bed anyway. i'm glad i gat my calculus homework done. i got a 94 on it, so i'm pretty happy. that's good considering i didn't get any help on it. i need to find a study group for calculus. i probably need them for all my classes. my roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. i said yes. they do go out a lot. i don't think i've ever seen them study. my friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. i wonder how they are going to pass their classes. i'm almost done. i only have 30 more seconds. then i get to go to bed. good night!

"i am very tired bc i have been studying all day for various classes. i know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. this semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. i can't believe that i am having to take these evening classes i much rather have my 8:00 classes so that i could go to work and make some money now i don't what i am going to do. i guess become a male escort ha ha. i guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. alsoo on my mind is the fact that i am kind of seeing 2 girls. i find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now i am broke all i have to offer is my heart. i don't know bc about 2 weeks ago i was pretty much dateless and desperate and now i am seeing these two girls and i have two others wanting to go out sometime. this sucks because they are all great girls and i don't want to hurt either of them. but i can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. it always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when i start dating somebody seriously i suddenly become attractive again. i am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. man once again this sucks!!! what else am i thinking about graduating. i am tired of the school life i want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. then again what am i talking about i am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks i get. if i didn't have conscience i would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. no money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. why can't my parents be rich. i wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. i just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am i going to pay the bills. and day in and day out i see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. but do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted? one can only wonder but i would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. but i guess like my dad said ""son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. "" hes not a educated man by any means but i believe he is right on this matter. for that reason i keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. now that i have rambled on for 20 minutes i am signing off.

"okay, here we go. i am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. i don't know how i can do this considering that i type pretty fast and also i am in the ugl and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that i type. oh well, no one seems to be listening. i am really tired right now and all i can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. it's only been one minute! i can't do this for that long. i have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm i had a fun time last night. i got in at 6 in the morning. if only my mother could see me now. that's the latest i've ever gotten in. am i typing loud? i don't want to do this anymore. i am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that i am typing. bored bored bored bored. i miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in barnes and noble i was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and i really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow i held it back. hell right now i want to cry. i really miss all of my dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. i guess it's inevitable, though. i mean i've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but i never thought that it really would be this hard. i'm living on my own. i am my own mother now. that's pretty damn scary! i think i'm responsible though. i've always been able to manage my time wisely. even my mom agrees with that. it's only been 3 minutes. or 4 maybe. i really like this guy i met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. i'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. i hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. i'm really paranoid right now. i don't want him to see that i'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks i'm stalking him anyway. i'm really not. i think i am inventing things in my head. i do that a lot. i can't believe i'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. well, hopefully not. i mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. yikes! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least i am assuming that it is. so, with that in mind i really am open to write whatever the hell i want to write. this is for my benefit, in essence. like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! i really like that guy. i hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe tuesday. hell, i'm sick of waiting around for this guy. i always do this. i cling on so fast to people i'm interested in even after just meeting them. it's like i have a onetrack mind and it's all i can think about. that's pretty scary, huh? wow i just scrolled up and i've written a lot. a lot of really boring stuff too. he probably won't call tomorrow. who am i kidding? i can't keep doing this to myself. it's really unhealthy. i just want to cry after realizing this. it's such a horrible thing. i am putting this guy up on a pedestal is that how you spell it? and like if he messes up just a little bit, then i think that he hates me and i'm just this horrible person. god i say the stupidest things around him sometimes. i'm so concerned with trying to impress him that i just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but i am again blowing it out of proportion. who am i kidding, i need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. like everyone i meet, i hold off on just for that rare chance that i might get to date this guy. i am a weird person. i am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. it feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. whoa that's scary. i love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. not really. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. i feel like each letter i type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. how did that go so fast? what did i write about? i can't even remember. i really don't want to look back at what i wrote either because i'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but i'm sure i will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, i envy your patience. until next time. that is all.

"i have no idea how to start this, so i'm just going to start typing and discover what happens!. i just got off the phone with my boyfriend, keil. i miss him a lot, a whole lot. we've just been going out for 8 months last saturday, but it feels like we've been together forever. i can't imagine my life right now without him. he still lives at home, near houston, and i don't get to see him as often as i would like, but if it's meant to be it will be. it will be hard, definitely, but it should be worth it. he tells me all the time how he loves me, and how he will marry me. he even asked me last week, well not officially, but he did ask me what i would say if he asked me to marry him right then. i had no clue what to say i was really confused. i'm so unsure of what to do. i miss him so much it's unbelievable. sometimes i wish i had stayed home to go to college because it's going to be so hard for the next 4 years, maybe 5. all of my friends love him and his friends love me, it's almost too perfect, if that is possible. his parents are my parents and his brother and i have become very close and get along great. i can imagine having them as inlaws. i was always brought up knowing that you never get along with your inlaws, but i don't see how that could happen. this weekend my roommate and i are going home. we've grown up together. i've known her since the second grade and we've been close friends since seventh. i'm glad that i know her. i don't see how people can come to a place like this and get a roommate they've never met before. that would have added a lot of stress to my life. not like i don't already have enough stress. actually, college hasn't been as stressful as i imagined it to be. however, i'm sure that will all change as soon as we start having exams and finals. ugh. i'm not looking forward to that! i've always been the kind of person to put more stress in my life than is needed. a couple of my friends pick on me saying i ""freak out too easily"". but it doesn't feel like it to me. i don't know, maybe they're right! i was raised an only child, until recently. my mother and biological father divorced when i was four and my mom remarried the man i call dad when i was six. my stepfather has 2 sons and one daughter (who is my age). but, they never lived with us they would spend the occasional weekend at our house but not very often was it longer than a weekend. my entire life changed about 2 months ago when my stepbrother trey moved in. he took over my life. it was crazy. suddenly he had all of the attention. i know i sound like a jealous brat, but really he did. not even just from my parents, suddenly he was my boyfriend's best friend. i could not get away from him. i have worked for my dad's company for 3 years, and then all of a sudden he started working there too. my entire life changed in the past 2 months. i gained a brother, left home for college, lost some friends by leaving, gained some friends by coming, and i am now living a totally different lifestyle.

"i'm very tired right now. i know that i have not been getting the amount of sleep that i need. is this how college is all the time? over this past weekend, i realized that i am beginning to get very homesick. i really miss my family, friends, and my dog. i started crying when i was on the phone with my brother earlier today. school is getting stressful, especially with band. i got a letter today saying i needed to work more on my routines. i don't know what to do. i've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. i practice and try to keep up with my studies. i think i really need to focus myself a little more. sometimes i think it is the new freedom that is causing this. i know what i need to do, i just need to get motivated to do them. i also need to learn how to not procrastinate. i've been thinking a lot about andrew lately, and about the church. i'm still so indecisive about what to do. sometimes i think that i believe and sometimes i think that i'm really not sure. now i'm thinking about death. i don't think there is anything i fear more than that, and what's sad is i know that everyone must pass through it. it terrifies me. i would never take my own life. i'm too scared of what's after, and i love my life to much. even with all of the stress i still find things interesting. i am still proud of the things i have achieved. i have very high goals for myself and i am so excited about the future. there are so many things to look forward too. why do people get depressed? i've never been one to be truly unhappy. even when there are times i said i was depressed"" i never really was. it makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. i was talking to chris yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. it made me want to cry. i don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. he is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. why don't people see that? why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good? you know that makes me think. i am so obsessed with my life and what i do and the people i know. i think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as i am. we all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. i think that this assignment is pretty cool. i actually do this quite often. just start writing things down. oh man! i just thought of what i was writing last week, about the first football game. i don't think i could ever described the rush when i marched through that tunnel. it was so crazy with over 80,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. i had the room to myself this weekend. my roommate went out of town. it was nice. i love being with people and being with my friends, but i also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. my roommate is really nice. i feel i've been blessed because we get along so well. i haven't met as many people as i thought i was going to meet up here. well. i guess i have met people, but i haven't made as many friends as i thought. friendships just take time though. i really wish michelle was here. i miss her. i was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. she is always been such a great friend. i respect her so much. i don't know what i would do with myself if it had been my mom. that is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. when michelle's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. i don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own mom's huge hugs the day we found out. i was so upset, and michelle had me call everyone and tell them. that was so hard. so many people thought it was a cruel joke. why do people do that? go into denial. i guess i would have if somebody had called me and told me that. that was two years ago. time flies so fast. it doesn't even seem like two years. only like yesterday. sometimes i wish we could just freeze time. during those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, i think it would be nice. oh look, my time is almost up.

"i wish i had a car though, but i think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until i can afford one. but i will always get by, i know. well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so i still have to wake up at 7 am even though i have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. well i didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. that's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her gpa so maybe just maybe she can come to austin and live somewhere around here. i wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. anyway, i'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. it's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 70 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 50 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. just kept on saying ""can you feel that!"" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. i guess that's the focus to my whole life. not sure if that's good or bad or what. probably what got me in trouble last semester when i was half way thru the semester. pretty crazy that i'm my worst enemy, but in a way, i guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if i didn't kick my own butt to do better who would? so i just keep on chugging. i don't know why i'm so success driven? lord knows i'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but i never can seem to do that. try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. oh well. i'll probably grow out of it (please please please). so enough of that, i hope the aggies have lost against fsu because then i get to email my ag friends and laugh. but then again that might not be the greatest idea if the horns don't fair that well this year. don't know what i'm listening to on the radio now. oh yea acdc!! rock on! anyway, i loved that howard stern movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. movies, that's a topic. i love going to see movies. just like the escape i guess. thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with kevin spacy usual suspects, that movie was great. also, that primal fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe. i was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past friday (yes i was a pathetic party pooper but i did manage to do some socializing). anyway i get these movies and come home. now i'm already disappointed because i have this great new tv in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but fox thru a lot of colored snow. so i figure i'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. but noooooo, the vcr is goofed or something. it may have something to do with the tracking, but i don't have the tape anymore so i can't experiment. i'm usually very good which technical things. i knew everything about my first vcr before it came out of the box. but last friday was definately not my day (triple low i've heard it called). but oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (mom's) sauce so that was good. not a complete loss. man i would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. so anyway, i have 5 minutes or so to type. i have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. tell you anything about me? actually, i'm a pretty neat ship keeper; i do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) tv box. but until the cable guy comes on wed. , it'll probably stay there. i have to make sure that i can support my mother beginning this summer because i think she may need it at some point. wish i had a godsent car that would work and then i could probably swing insurance payments and gas, but with car payments it'd be too much. oh my, listening to eye of the tiger, how old is that?!?!?! so, maybe i should just go to sleep after writing this. i need to go see if i can to the pretesting for this class, but i tried before this and couldn't get it to load up. something about the server being down. well, such is life. i think i should do pretty good this semester, shooting for a 4. 0 again. got to stay in head of my brother, we are so competitive, he's a yr behind me but transfered in with a bit more credit than i did, and with leaving mid-semester last yr, he's got a good chance to stay pretty close. times up, bye now!!!

"so far this class seems alright. i means the girls in this class look pretty good. there's this one girl in there, i haven't talked to her yet but i have to because she 's always looking at me. she looks pretty cute, but i can tell she is young. there's this other hispanic girl who has real tight curly hair . she looks incredible. shit all the girls in there do well who ever is reading this can probably tell hat i think about sex a lot. its strange because i always find myself daydreaming about having a wife and kids, you know having a real family. going to visit y folk and other friends with my kids. but it like no how hard i try, after i have sex with a lady, i just lose total respect for them, i just look at there flaws and i only look at the negative. with me, the way i think about a girl is totally different after we engage in hot intense intimacy. some times i don't know if it is just irrational thought processes or what. i know its not normal. but what is normal. normal is what society says is ok. but who is the society, whites blacks hispanic, the melting pot of the us. or the world. there are so many different cultures and societies that essayist that who is to say that their ways are better then anybody else's. how can you say that is right and that is wrong because society deems it that way. if society is forever changing, are our moral standards to be forever changing as well. well it has been so far in our human history. times up, nice talking with you ",0,1.354308 -1.049455 0.98477 -0.739697 -0.605042 -1.431603 0.886023 0.757956 1.999496 -1.427296 -0.171747 -0.590446 1.147085 -0.148599 0.612621 0.0 -0.04277 -1.151495 -1.738004 1.390142 -1.459375 0.850188 0.124767 -0.095347 1.837674 0.00422 -1.16481 -0.72422 -0.40912 -0.346785 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.200006 -0.906028 -0.37042 -0.249172 0.547102 0.927852 0.219372 -0.514514 -1.038726 0.376393 1.297339 2.93704 3.721181 2.707376 -1.093488 2.336314 1.627883 0.887241 3.840964 -0.324833 -1.4141 0.629682 -1.214687 0.149089 -1.506427 -0.954251 0.710827 1.870874 -0.942859 0.471766 0.549784 1.129261 0.385367 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.106448 0.452504 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.451794 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.207065 4.845618 3.596791 4.538371 4.415158 4.681521,573
"why am i so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in my life, i have no clue. its probably becasue i'm a freshman or is it because i just don't know what i'm am doing in this school, it's too hard. i don't know how to work the computer system, i have tons of homework, and its all catching up to me at the same time, it's unreal. i'm so bogged down with work and i have so much stuff to do but i'm sitting here typing on my computer on something that i don't know will even get sent to you. my friends are talking to me while i'm trying to write this assignment, and i can't' make my mind focus on on certain thing at all, the music is too loud and i have people trying to talk to me over the internet. these blinking lights are pissing me off i wish these people would shut up and let me tend to my business at hand. i need to read, do my pre cal and i just don't have the time. i don't know how to do my physical science lab, and reading just takes too muck time. i have a date tonight, i don't have time to take them out, but i have to or that wouldn't be nice, i'm going through rush and that takes up more time than anything. i can't' deal with this anymore. i'ts starting to drive me crazy , but hopefully soon i will get used to it. its such a change from senior year to freshman year of college. you go from doing nothing basically to have to read every night and do all sorts of written assignment, it's impossible twenty minutes is up got to run ",0,0.609133 -0.617012 1.205974 -1.062486 -0.228651 1.881034 -1.508582 -0.724583 -1.569299 -1.33263 0.003529 -0.590446 0.48256 -0.239031 -0.128817 0.0 -0.04277 0.384935 0.637248 -0.795527 0.458118 0.23639 -1.256592 -0.7679 -0.624052 -1.403982 1.2585 -0.745726 -2.023085 -1.758527 -1.100231 0.01892 -1.01263 -0.028028 -0.421009 -1.109326 -0.591821 0.162375 -1.254189 -0.672944 -1.038726 0.12779 0.001478 -0.732147 0.605458 -0.423225 -1.093488 -1.625879 -0.910034 -1.385347 -0.28418 -0.328594 -1.469278 0.943715 -0.356968 1.888143 3.567926 1.729384 0.570209 -0.059057 1.736789 0.946577 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.312539 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.073754 0.767395 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 2.271486 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.180258 5.394344 3.677533 4.696283 4.755314 4.297425,877
"as i sit here at my desk typing, all i can think about is how hot i am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. i am under a lot of stress right now because i have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since i have trouble focusing on them. by body is starting to sweat, maybe i should tell my ra to turn down the ac. i am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much i read it, i just can't comprehend what the book is saying. i'm sure i will struggle in biology this year. at first, i couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that i am doing this i understand the purpose behind it. this is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. my stomach feels extremely full because i just came from the dobie cafeteria. i really wish i hadn't eaten so much junk food, i need to eat healthier. i am really regretting eating that ice cream, i have got to stop doing that. i also need to work out more. it all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason i am so hot is because i am sunburned. when you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? it is obviously clear that i am unfamiliar with the way my body works. i am dreading class tomorrow because i am so behind on my reading. i probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. i only have to write for a few more minutes. i wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. if i take great notes and read, even if i don't comprehend it very well, will i still be able to do well on the tests? my elbow has just started throbbing because i scraped it water skiing earlier today. i really wish i wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time i extend my elbow. oh great! time's up. talk to you later. katie ",0,-0.474035 0.951698 -0.035532 0.38495 0.33194 -0.567886 0.191586 0.098151 0.46357 -1.048631 -0.143856 0.513108 1.13981 -0.204799 0.686897 0.0 -0.04277 1.002798 0.855327 0.020641 0.907995 2.429304 -1.126642 -1.40594 -0.624052 -1.006675 -0.425487 -0.793909 -1.539774 -1.933602 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.388757 1.227844 -0.534354 -1.109326 1.862173 4.545292 0.803281 -0.378831 0.906153 0.002888 0.027635 1.843989 2.417202 -0.182336 -0.04922 -0.937434 -0.347156 -0.234338 -1.34699 -0.157239 -1.41708 1.15997 0.476346 -0.671603 0.181686 1.219833 -1.425147 -1.712265 -0.822957 0.463024 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.436251 -0.007517 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.335929 -0.051693 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.304714 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.526367 4.993671 3.824196 4.998939 5.040831 4.60101,1070
ok i am starting writhing. i really don't know hat to right about but i will give it my best shot. i am going home today pretty excited about that. but in some ways i am not because i don't want to put up with my family. i am feeling a little bit guilty now for saying that because they are only trying to help me out. i like the way the sun shines through my window in my room. i am really happy to be here at university of texas. it is hard to write for a long period of time about nothing. i feel like i am writing in a journal or something. it is really quite today on my floor usually it would be extra loud because it is friday. i am really excited to be in the longhorn band. it has been a really good experience so far and i hope it continues. i have meet some really great people and i hope that this friendship will continue for a lifetime. i saw one of my best friends sisters today and i was really surprised. for one i wouldn't think that she would talk to me but she did. i hope to see her again soon. i really need to get packed up to go home. i need to go get fitted for my uniform in band too. i took the pretesting this morning i never would have thought it would have taken so long. and it repeated the same questions over and over. it was really annoying ,1,0.230276 0.563485 0.657066 0.461054 0.50837 -0.250708 -0.317947 -0.323311 0.001253 -1.540895 -0.184104 -0.590446 1.129012 0.653204 0.039808 0.0 -0.04277 0.861297 0.719727 -0.795527 0.545139 -0.742368 -0.454121 0.102201 0.746154 -0.46341 0.805245 -0.386624 0.485321 1.773138 -0.203974 2.945898 -1.208736 -0.906028 -0.297114 -1.109326 0.705182 -0.040514 0.148454 1.650046 0.41076 -0.229464 -1.441084 0.076611 0.208698 -0.190891 0.463062 -0.131627 0.922084 -1.071941 -0.705294 0.538147 0.238323 0.930095 1.003438 0.115108 1.312698 -0.954251 0.135383 -0.599749 0.834951 0.706321 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.256582 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.994107 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.108197 4.878612 3.354165 4.58654 5.258743 3.982869,1152
"that is what i think about a lot right now. having finished highschool, i was mentally done. i had had enough of intensive studying. i forgot however that i still had to college. the other thing i also think about a lot is the fact that i wish i was in the east coast studying. i wanted an out of state experience. but unfortunately could not get it. n. e. ways. right now i am also thinking of my first paper. i think it will be easy. but the fact remains that i have to do it. i can do papers once in a while. but if it ends up being every week or even every other week. i am going to have some serious problems. i already am having trouble reading. there is just too much to read and i am used to not having to read. in highschool, if you paid attention in class then you don't need to read. in college. paying attention in class usually doesn't matter. some teachers teach different things. but the crux of the info remains in the book. there will never be enough class time to teach everything in the book . so you have to read in order to teach yourself. i went to chicago this weekend. the last attempt to extend my vacation as much as i could. now on i keep telling myself that i need to start buckling up. but chicago was awesome. i met all my friends i met when i went to a camp in d. c. during the summer. it was cool seeing them all again. and making sure we keep in touch. i don't know if we'll keep in touch though. a lot of them live far. chicago. new york. its hard maintaining friends here at ut let alone 1000 miles away. ut is pretty fun although. no matter where i8 am i can have fun. its just that i wasn't wanting this as my experience. since i have to take it i will make the most of it, but i know there could be better. plus. austin is almost like an extension from houston. and one of my goals was to get away from houston. to get away from the same people. to get away from a bunch of social crap. the incredible thing is the fact at how awesome some of the girls are. i'm already having fun here. four days into school and i got a lot of fun!! i guess this is different than the type of girls i hung out in houston. most of them were pretty traditional. here its really easy to get to know some girls who like to play around but are also pretty cool people. not the skanky or ho type. just cool girls who like physical fun. oh well. i'm getting pretty tired of expressing my stream of consciousness. plus i've been typing for about 20 minutes any ways. . so if anyone is really reading this. i'll see you later ",1,0.820225 -1.58756 -0.401745 -1.192027 -1.35857 -0.806851 0.221865 0.393183 0.414216 -0.598019 -0.251809 -0.590446 0.066123 -0.126696 -0.189216 0.0 -0.04277 -1.242073 -0.806523 -0.168316 -0.896271 0.780991 -1.074798 -0.171167 -0.624052 0.485431 1.745203 -0.051575 -0.252817 0.380988 -1.100231 -0.528285 -0.974797 -0.906028 -0.646317 -0.615658 0.375298 -1.318793 -0.749208 0.616673 -1.038726 0.016759 0.186407 -0.066402 1.948923 -1.194193 -0.290986 -0.649442 -0.687574 -0.619754 0.638025 0.102292 0.446864 -0.920406 -0.027626 0.628411 -0.352083 -0.954251 0.408799 0.275457 -0.795431 -0.411008 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.011816 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.702117 -1.080157 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.120344 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.621932 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.117937 4.689446 3.146264 4.622363 4.825286 4.824609,494
"hmmm, what should i write. this is so hard for me, but i think i'll make it work. that guy just signed on again, and i won't be surprised if he sends me an instant message. but i really don't want to talk to him. the refrigerator is making this humming noise that always bothers me, even when i'm sleeping. i hope that my roommate sleeps over at trey's apartment because i don't want to hear her snore. there is somebody talking outside, i can hear them even way up here. i should turn off that light by my bed because if it burns too long everything gets too hot. the creaking of the walls here bother me too. and now some girl just ran down the hall. the airplanes can be really loud here because we are so high. i don't understand why people can't shut their doors quietly or push their chairs in without making so much noise. i wonder if anyone is going to call me in the middle of this. that would make me lose everything. those people that call that person next door are really pretty stupid. they let the phone ring like fifteen times. in a small dorm room is that really necessary? my typing has gotten so bad, i hate to capitalize. i should have sent that letter on saturday, but i was just too lazy to bring it down there. now it's going to have a weird date on the letter that doesn't match the postmark date on the envelop. i guess i'm not the only one that does that though, so it's ok. my feet are cold. they are always so cold. and today the girl next door was complaining about how hot it was. i am never hot in this room. there is some humming coming from outside. i wonder if it is just a bus being idle right now. my computer just got more energy or something because it made some noise. people are walking in the hall now, i can here them. these walls must not have good insulation. there goes a loud car that was revved up too quickly. that doesn't make sense to me. i should wash my dishes. i wonder what my neighbors are talking about when they just said ""that's really bad. "" my wrists are starting to hurt, i should probably change my hand position. i also should do my laundry. the rest of my laundry. i need to wash my towels. i wonder how long i would have to wait in line for the stuff. probably too long, i think i will just wait till another day. that girl just coughed again. that makes me think that i should buy some cough drops. i am getting sleepy. i wish i wasn't so lazy. my eyes feel like their drooping. i wonder what the score is on the cowboy game. i need to sit straight so that my back doesn't hurt. i wish i knew why my back hurts so much, i think it must have been that sunday i helped dad. i really wish i had eaten something other than burger king. i should have eaten subway. i enjoy tuna subs better. i just yawned. i think i need stamina. my watch is digging into my are. i now have a whole impression of my watch in my arm. that kind of stuff annoys me. this watch is too little. it is made for little kids. i'm going to close my eyes while i type. i hope i don't mess up too many words. that would a bad think if it couldn't be read. i need to get a haircut, i want to get it styled, but i'm scared that the way it will be done won't look good. i'm taking off my watch now, it 's bothering me too much. why does my stapler have such a big crack down the middle of it i wonder why the mail didn't come yesterday. that makes me so mad. i bet i would have had mail. this gum is tasting pretty gross but it tastes better than the burger. yawn. now i have goosepimples. why am i so cold. i should probably put on a long shirt. why doesn't my camera rewind all the way. maybe i should just get a new one. one of those advantage ones that i can take to switzerland. that would be great for all the scenic pictures. yawn. why do my eyes water so much when i yawn. that is very annoying. there goes the telephone again. i bet it will ring for a long time. nope it only rang once. i guess the girl is there now. my computer just froze up kinda, i bet i did something wrong, i am always doing something wrong. i wonder how fast i can type without making lots of mistakes. so far i am doing pretty good. why is it whenever you say that you get worse. , the second i said it, it got worse. now my wrists are really hurting. someone is going into their room, and the just slammed their door. that just bothers me so much.

"ok i begin writing now without thinking about the writing that i'm doing this is so eird why do this why proffessor make us do this will he be reading what we're writing or not and will he be able to see what i'm thinking by just reading. will it offer insight into what my mind works like is it going to help him see what kind of person that i am i miss jun where is she where was she last night i want to have sex with her i want to have a relationship with hertooo this is weird i'm writing dowwn exactly what i'm thinking and it all comes so fast i'm not even thinking like i normally think usually there' ssome kind of method to the way that i do it but now i'm just writing and i'm not even having complete thoughts leading to ideas and resolutions now i want to shift thinking so that i can do some productive thinking or maybe not waste time but i'm stuck on this and i guess i should do what the assignment says jun makes a sound that's so sexy when i lick her earlobe it makes me want to fuck her wow i wonder if anyone will read that and think i'm some kind of pshycho this is so weird i shouldn't care what i write, but my name's on this so i have to worry but i'm sick of worrying about things that's why i drink so that nothing matters that's why i like smoking pot because no worries that's not why i like to have relationships with girls though that's more psychological and i think thati have these relationships because its something to put my energy into to figure out that i'm not into damn i just stopped accidentally owh well now its time for a new stream i need to do this work so that i can get my good grades so that i can get into good school so i can make good money so i can have happy life so i'll be happy but so often to do this i have to do things that make me unhappy i like this classbut not some of my other classes like english where the teacher's a bitch and where i spend the whole time looking at jun because she's a beautiful girl and i want her why do so many of my thoughts concern sex and lust annd anger and fear and worry it would be easier to eliminate the last three this isn't really stream of consciousness writing because i'm actually being much more random in my thoughts than i usually amn so this assignment doesn't make any sense i wonder if thy use this for any psychoanalytical purpose i wonder if other people's writing is similar to minee in any way i guess so since there are fundamental similarities between all human brains and minds that can't be overcome and i'm not that diffeerent from others in that respect i wish i was more like others but not sacrificing the things that are important to me i wish i had a steady girlfriend that always makes me much happier i just met jun and hooked it up with herand now i don't understand the rlationship and don't know if it'll continue and that's frustrating because i want it to and at the same time don't because she's dkind of a slut and might ahve a disease but i lust for her and she's the only girl who's paid me any attention so i really want to have a relationship with her though i'll prbably get hurt and feel like i should never have done it and then i'll be sad again but for now i'm happy when i'm with her and i feeel good when i'm with her and its good i'm still worried that i think about hers o much and that someone will read this that's why these tests are total crap because i have to spend so much time worrying about what the shrink thinks because i ahve this facade to put up for some reason although it won't affect my grade and it won't affect my relationship because i probably won't ever see him agaian and i won't have to face him but still i worry why do i do that what am i so afraido of revealing and why ami so afraid of people really knowing what's inside am i that evil and suppressing that much of myself that its making me put up a false front that i think everyone should see why do i opress ok this is really weird i'm starting to get very introspective this is probably not what i was supposed to todo but oh well now i'll be able to keep typing i forgato my ttrain of thought my typing is becomeing more and more flawed because i'm mjust closing my eyes and letting it all flow out on paper fuck jun i'm letting it go i hte something i love something i'm getting in tough cwith emotions i want women i like them they smell good this is funny to whoever reasds this oh well laugh because i guess it really is maybe i'll read it myself afterwords and have a good giggle at myself and maybe that's the point of life to be comfortable withwho you are and what goes on in your head its almost time to stop althought i was just getting very interested int he results and in to what i was writing times up.

"it is 12:53 on tuesday and my roommate and i just finished eating lunch and came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. my computer in our room is not hooked up to the internet yet, so for the time being i have to come down here. that's ok. the guy just came over because we forgot to give him our ids. oops. oh well. anyway, i'm really sad lately. i miss all my friends from high school. everyone i've met so far has been really nice and everything; i just miss how close we all were last year. i could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that i knew and would feel comfortable with. here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many people that i don't know. every face that i pass on campus is another stranger. actually, i have seen a few people that i know from other places. earlier today i saw brittany. but it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. i was so comfortable there. i don't know. i should probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since i'm going off about high school and college and what have you, but i'm kind of just blabbering so whatever. i am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. i miss my comfort zone that i had at anderson and i want it back!! hey! i just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. i guess i can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. it's probably been more like seven minutes. i don't like this keyboard. it's kind of hard to type on. this assignment is actually harder than i thought it would be. i mean, it's not hard, because i'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. i think it's crazy that so many anderson people are in my psychology class. it also freaks me out that alex is in our class. since you don't know about alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. i think underneath that tough guy russian thing he has going for him he's really probably a very nice person, but i don't know how easy it is for me to look past the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at city park. so i wouldn't fail alex if i were you. he might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it ""axe"" or ""ax""? i don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. i would really like to get to know him though - i think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. i think that time is probably almost up, but i would kind of like to keep writing. i think i will. the temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. i don't know where that thought came from. i am scared about having to write papers. what if my professors don't like the way i write? i've always loved to write, but i like writing creatively. i'm pretty bad at comparing and contrasting and all my research papers are boring. i mean i got good grades on them, but later i'd go back and read them and be like ""hey did i actually write this? yuck. "" i think i'm probably being hard on myself. i wonder how many times i have used the word probably in this assignment so far. i bet a lot. i hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. i wonder what angie's deal is. she used to be so nice, but ever since dis and i rushed she has been so rude. that's her problem, i know. and it kind of always justifies the fact that i didn't like her that much. i always had to act like i did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has always rubbed me the wrong way. that's what i told brian. brian -- what to do about brian? i wish i knew i wish i could have some answer. i hate leading him on the way i did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. i know he needs me and that's what i love about him. when i'm around him i feel special and needed and important. but i just don't know if that is enough.

"it is really hot in here. i wish someone would turn the ac down. i hope i didn't miss anything in calculus today, but i can get the notes from nicole. i need to do so much stuff this week with little time to do it in. i need to email david and reply to all of the emails i got yesterday. i need to hang up my pictures in my room, but don't have anything to hang them with. i still haven't cashed the check from mom, and i'm running low on money. college is sooooo expensive and there's always too much to do. i hardly have time to do everything that i need to do. i have to pay for all of the clubs i want to join and speaking of that, i have to write essays and fill out applications for tx sweethearts, spirits, the children's hospital, and go to a meeting for aed. i have a meeting at the adpi house tonight and wed night!!!! all these meetings--at least one everyday'night. i also have so much chemistry homework tonight. i keep falling behind in all of my classes. as soon as i catch up in one of them, i fall behind in another. but last night i did a lot of homework, so that helped a little. you know, everytime i am trying to write a thought, twenty more come into my mind. i wonder who looks at these writings and if they get bored of hearing everyone's thoughts. i have to do seven minute abs tonight because my roommate and i are going to for two weeks to see if we can get a six pack. my fingers are starting to tingle from typing so much, so fast. i wonder what's for dinner tonight at the sorority house. i hope it's something healthy. i haven't been eating very healthy since i left home. not that i ate healthy before but at least i had complete meals, not just pizza or junk food. what else am i thinking of?. maybe if i look around my room. i really need to clean my crap off the floor and desperately need to do laundry. i normally go home to do it but i do not have time to go all the way home and waste time there, waiting for it to dry like last time. although i did promise my brother that i'd bring him up to my dorm to check it out since he hasn't seen it yet. and i really want to see my dogs. i think i miss bear more than anyone else. probably because i cannot talk to him over the phone or email him like i can my parents. russ calls me nonstop and really gets on my nerves. i feel bad when i'm mean to him but i have so much stuff to do and don't really have time to talk about nothing to him. uh, oh, my sweetmate just got home from yesterday. she stays at her boyfriend's house almost every night. gretchen told me that she came in at 7am this morning making tons of noise. she doesn't care about other people and is so self-centered. i hope she doesn't come in here and read this. that'd be very bad. i need to go to tops to get my pictures from last friday night. i had so much fun and want something to remember the night by.

"i don't know what i am going to do in this. this type of assignment is something i have not done before. i guess i have no idea is because that i do not have a topic to write on. i have always have had a topic assigned to me. this is el-hazard music. just by looking at the images of the cd cover, i can tell that this is going to be good. in fact, i am listening to it right now. i have no idea why i am writing this down in here, but it is a part of my thought. this has a lot of base, but it does not stick out. has a very good balance of treble and base. what am i going to write about. i am hungry. may be i can go to kinsolving later. i think that they start dinner at four thirty. another track has started. this is a slow song now. it is the music from the fourth episode where the demon goddess is freed from her master's control and gained her freedom for the first time. the cat ura was cool. she can mountain climb. i think that was a cliff. she is the coolest cat ever. i have to do this for 20 minutes. what oh yes the ura. the series is el-hazard. they don't have anything good on the internet on it. this sucks. i have to download that song tonight. i hope this time the connection is good enough. why is some of the music stupid. wait, if i listen to this closely, it is very good if the voice of the actress is older. the story has good development. the ova series starts with the discovery of the demon goddess ifurita in a certain high school and the main guy is sent to the world el-hazard through a portal created by ifurita. why is the tv series different from the oav series. the princess rune venus looks cute, i like her better in the ova series. i think a world like el-hazard lives in our hearts. rune venus was rescued by the teacher. that was cool. fugisawa kick. there were this little girl in the story. she was aielle. the 3 priestess was pretty. fire, wind and water. reminds me of ah megamisama. 15 minutes. ifurita was awakened by junnai. then he and ifurita invaded roshiraria the kingdom of el-hazard. they had to use the eye of god for defense. the tv series was called the wanderers. that was cool. the main guy can access ancient relics. he gave back ifurita her freedom by turning off the master obey chip. the war was still going on the roshitaria used the eye of god. kimdom of bugrom got kicked. the shadow nation intervened. the moved the eye of god out of control for the revenge a long time ago. they were remnant of the tribe that come across this world when the eye was first fired. they were hated afterwards. makoto. i am hooked on this series too much. the main guy got control of the eye through ifurita but ifurita sustained the impact and was transported to the location where the high school will be in 10000 years. ifurita then waited 10000 years for makoto to appear and send makoto to the land of el-hazard. after the impact, ifurita learned the secret of eye of god. it is a dimensional cannon. what was cool. is it 20 minutes yet. still 2 minutes. have i been keeping time correctly. kor orange road. i am still listening to the same music. cool. i can't wait to see the tv series tape # 2. it is going to be very good. i don't know i guess i am too excited about this thing to stop, i have not even realized i stayed on the same topic for long. men.

"so today has been one of the worst days ever. i found out that i didn't do that great on my biology exam 1. and i aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 1. i have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and i am still not done with it. i am hungry too. i haven't had dinner tonight. well not yet. so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now. this is crazy. i don't know what to write. its hard to write for 20 minute. it has only been 3 minute. this is crazy. i wonder how long i will get to use this computer. oh, i don't know if my class code is right or not, but i think that's what it is. so we will see. i hope this is the right one. who knows. i have no idea what to write. i don't even know what i am suppose to write. i am really hungry. why wouldn't this prescreening survey thing work? this is very frustrating. i feel like crying now. oh gosh the thing worked and i want to get it over with but i can't stop writing. i wish i had started writing earlier. i think what i just wrote didn't make any sense. no i am pretty sure it didn't make any sense. i think it doesn't matter. i realized that u think faster then you type. well at least i do. may be because i type slow. but who knows. i think everyone thinks faster then they type. anyways, so i want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but i can't. so i wonder what liz is doing this weekend. i have to study this weekend , because i am really behind. i make a lot of typing error. i have to improve my typing. i want to go to jcl and eat. then again i don't want to go by myself. i wonder if kristi would come. she probably would. liz needs to come get her book. i kind of feel obligated, but i don't want to call. it's her book and she should care for it. she should call me. besides no one ever calls me other than kristi. liz is a very nice girl and i want to be good friend with her, but she is always too busy with her high school friends. they are nice too. why is it only 11 minute. it needs to be 20 minute already. i wonder what annette wrote for her writing assignment. ok so this is not a great assignment. i mean its very simple. it's very easy, but it is kind of annoying. it's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself. i mean you are writing for the class. who knows. this is getting old. actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast. ashley was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies. now that's crazy. well now i am hungry again. this is not great. this is actually kind of annoying. i think i wrote this line twice. i am not sure. like the way i am not sure about my class code. i know i am right but its kind of hard to agree with it. ok so i don't make any sense again. see i am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy. i know he is not going to read this but what if he does? he is going to think i am idiot. why am i like this? i don't get it. no i am really annoying. i can tell. but oh well. i am who i am. people should deal with it. see now i don't make sense again i don't even know why i thought about those stuff. and wrote it here. i can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating. except that there is nothing to cheat about. you will be cheating yourself. yay. only two minutes left. no it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast. i need to stop chatting on the internet. i can't even write a sentence properly. internet does no good to you. well at least not to me. ok i guess this is it then. only 30 sec left. yay. i guess i will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one. this is crazy. but ik ",0,-0.130656 -0.009204 0.868048 -0.153192 0.795919 0.12408 -1.447737 -0.837444 -1.160969 0.435736 -0.25714 -0.155712 -1.453169 0.041901 -1.541138 0.0 -0.04277 0.541059 0.03835 -0.590707 -0.11861 1.446469 -0.188267 1.866212 1.221461 -1.936527 -1.346578 0.445067 0.150754 0.318745 -0.496653 -0.546635 -0.109892 -0.906028 0.923834 -0.786905 1.445398 -0.239329 1.328253 1.258295 -0.062579 -0.637017 -0.38449 0.249601 -0.326278 0.278017 0.478885 -0.446211 -0.341551 0.050521 -0.914844 0.215348 -0.531926 2.502716 0.120458 -1.742494 -0.50382 -0.954251 -0.478125 -0.468617 -0.444953 -0.564623 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.841557 -0.745381 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.102689 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.311793 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.68189 4.974041 4.080233 4.506785 4.909016 4.300895,2259
"i'm stressed out about my calculus class i don't know if i'm going to be able to finish all the homework and be able to get an a in the class. i really want to make an a because that would increase my prospects at getting a good first job, of course that would only be good for a first job. i really don't like my job at heb it is really annoying, all people seem to be in a bad mood all the time and i don't find it that enjoyable. if i were somehow rewarded with more money i think it might be managable however, because i can't seem to get a raise out of them i'm going to look for another job. i hope my typing doesn't wake up my roomate my girlfriend is really distressed about our relationship i guess i'll have to write her an e-mail and make things better between us. how i would describe love right now, i've always thought that you had different degrees of love throughout your life, i would say that i love her however. i really hope my roommate is a deeper sleeper than i think he is because i know i would be annoyed if he were typing where i could hear it. tommorrow i have to go get my economics book in the morning and read part of that, college seems so stressful, i don't know if i'm going to be able to budget my time. the bookstores rip you off you pay all that money for books and then they buy them back cheaply and then sell them for the same price that you bought them for. that might be a good way to make some money buy opening a bookstore. my dad was telling me how having a low overhead would produce a lot of profits for something on the internet. i had better be quiet so my roomate doesn't hear me, but the noises in the hall are louder but not constent. he has too wake up at 7:00 in the morning to go to class. i don't know how well we are getting along, i guess he is an ok roommate but i wanted him to be a little more outgoing. i guess i'm going to have to meet people on my own which i'm not all that good at but i guess i'll have to try. i need to find out what my rights are in this room and if i'm able to type till just 12:00 or if i can type and make noise till one. i'm willing to try and make it as comfortable for him as i can because i want to fit in with him, but i don't know if i should draw any lines or not. i have all this homework and i don't know what to do about my time management. he just got up was it my fault or did he get up on his own, i don't want to intrude on his space but where does mine come in. i really like my computer it has everything i want it to have, but the company i ordered my graphics card for went out of business where am i going to get another graphics card. i wonder what else i'm going to have to do for homework, i hope it will be easy. i want to graduate early but can i do it or am i going to have to go all four years, if i graduate early i might have some money left for a car, i would really like a corvette but the insurance on them is so expensive especially until i'm 25. i don't know if i can handle doing all this stuff and do my homework as well, with my girlfriend and friends and still have time to work on the weekends time is suck a valuable asset. what else do i have to do.

" so, it's a tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. i ate dinner earlier and can feel the food digesting. i am rather anxious about something. not terribly that it is distracting, but i feel as though i am expecting something. it might be that i am nervous about school. it's a new place for me, coming from minnesota. i haven't really made my close group of friends. sure, i've been having loads of fun, but i still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. i haven't found my niche. it's almost like i am waiting for it to be a month from now when i've found my place. it's also hard in class, becuase i don't know many, hardly any at all, people in them. i don't have people where i can go to work on projects or anything. this makes me a little worried about how i am going to do, becuase i can't compare answers on homework with friends, and i can't discuss new concepts with anyone. i think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more stressful than i originally expected. but i am not worried because there are so many people here that i know it can't be too long before i find my place. austin is a great city also. that's a definite plus. the city has just a great atmosphere. i've seen two concerts here and i love it. i can't wait to see even more of the city and it's cool places. music is a big part of my life and i think that is really going to make me happy. it's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or something i will love to do. i am really excited to get to know some of the local musicians. that'll be cool. i also have feelings that i want to have a girlfriend. i don't really know what i want sexually. i feel like i want a steady girlfriend. someone who i can always be close with. i really think that will help make my transition into texas easier. but it's hard for me to find someone who i'll get along with this well. another thing i think about is committment. i dont' know if i want a long term relationship. also, would it be to distracting for be because of school? i certainly know that school is my priority, but now that i'm in college, i have to discover how much time i really need to spend doing work to maintain my gpa. i think that the first semester is the hardest because it's a new atmosphere and i have to test the limits and such. another thing that kind of worries me is my suitemate. he is a big partier, and although i like to party some, he's always up very late at night and is usually very loud. it's hard for me to tell whether it will last or if it's just the first week of school and he's really excited. i just hope that he will get to studying. i am sur that all will work out. i really feel that things usually do work out, and eventually i will feel hapiness and the anxious feeling will go away. i'm just anxious to not be anxious anymore.

"if i could actually play in major tournaments like the us open, the french open, the austrilia open, etc. even if just one tournament, i will be so greatful. as i containued watch these pros play, i push myself in working my way up there;i practice as much as i can,i try to learn as much as i can, from their mental part to their techniques; although it seems impossible that i will ever become as good as they are. yet, i never give up my dream of actually playing in one of the major tournaments because i believe that dreams do come true if i work hard for it. if this dream never come true i won't be disappointed at myself, at least there are great memories left in me. there are other dreams and missions i have planned to work for, now and in the future, and i will always be positive in every dreams i have and in whatever i do.

" when i got online tonight i was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person. the person, aka muffincheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night. last night! last night i was with sarah, my roomie, watching shrek! i was totally freaking out. i was telling sarah that i had a stalker! this ""muffincheeseqn"" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them. talk about freaky! well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me. what a friend! it ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'lil punk! anyhoo, that made my night though. i've been over at my friend danny's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow. i've been there since 5! i don't like the first program and i'm majoring in cs! what was i thinking! they should have a major in learning the abcs! oh man its only been 5 minutes. man, i think sarah needs to be quiet so i can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! so sarah has some pretty cute guys in her classes! i've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! oo i just remembered that i need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause i really don't want to write a five page paper! i'm not very good at writing papers. obviously! i'm not very good at calculus either. although, today i actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! i probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though. oh my gosh. i have a calculus midterm on friday! well next friday. i have to do some major studying this weekend. this weekend my parents will be out of town. it will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year. my mom just got a new job! yeah for my mom! she's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job. so we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills. thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0. my mom looked for a job for almost 3 months before she just got hired last week. she doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job. that's why she wants me to get an education. she doesn't want me to. sarah needs to shut up! she just walked into my room. oh my gosh she's singing the fresh prince of bel air song! lol she just read what i wrote. oh my gosh now she's playing her mello. she's in the longhorn band. she's a big band nerd. i was once a band nerd. i played the sax! wow i have like two minutes left! well right now i'm feeling. hungry! obviously my thoughts are everywhere! good-bye!

"well, first i'm thinking that i should've done this a few days ago instead of on the last day. there are still a few hours left, but it's never good to procrastinate. i guess it's ok because i've been very busy lately doing work for other classes. i'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 6th street and getting drunk, which is what i thought i was supposed to be doing. some of my friends call me a hermit"" now because i'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times. i don't really care. i'd rather be responsible. i do go out though. yesterday i went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game. now i'm feeling full and satisfied because i just ate a pizza and i was extremely hungry. i haven't felt this satisfied in a while. i don't really like most of the food in the cafeteria, but the pizza is good. i miss the food at home. i miss home a lot. i miss my family even though i talk to them over the phone just about every day. it's just not the same when you are away. life at home this summer was so simple. i was just in my house very comfortable and without worries. i would go out with my girlfriend every few days. i miss her desperately. i think i was supposed to also describe what i'm smelling. i don't really smell anything right now. i wish i could smell my girlfriend's perfume again. i think that's my favorite smell of all. it's weird because i sometimes ""remember"" what the scent was. i don't think that's supposed to happen. now i'm thinking that i've been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired. oh well. it's in the name of science. now i'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this. i feel sorry for whoever has that job. sorry for writing this much. sorry for not being very interesting. now i'm remembering that i missed the rain again. i missed yesterday's rain because i was in my psychology class. when i got out, the ground was wet. it happened again today on the count of my pre cal class. now i'm thinking that i probably should've done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because i think there should be a timer above this box thingy. now i don't know when to stop. i'm probably going to stop too soon. i'll get an f in this assignment. i'll fail this class and be dropped. then i won't be considered a full time student because i'm only taking 12 hours. i'll be forced to go home, and i will go home a failure. hmm. that probably won't happen. after all, i've been having so much here, even though it is away from all that i hold dear. i think i have 10 more minutes to go. now i'm feeling that i have to go take a leak. dammit. it'll have to wait. i'm still not sure what this is for and what it studies. maybe someone will read this and say that i'm crazy. that would be funny. all i need is confirmation. now i'm thinking that my time would be better spent outside. outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy. a very pretty day. i hate being inside. i'd much rather be outside. i have a good view of the outside from my window. i'm on the seventh floor so it's pretty cool. i think i'm doing this wrong. i'm still not sure why. i think my time is coming running out. yup, i'm done.

"jeez, why has it taken my so long to do this assignment? why do i always put everything off to the last minute??? procrastination seems to have effected my whole life. even when i was a little kid in elementary school i can rememeber putting off projects till the last night. my mom would always get mad and say you should wait till the last minute to do things, but for some reason that just never got through to me. i don't want to procrastinate. but it do. i always tell myself that i'm going to start it early, but it always ends up the same way. is this the way it's going to be my whole life? man, i hope not, but who am i kidding. this is the way my brain functions. procrastination is apart of me. i love the saying, hard work pays over time, but laziness pays off now. that's like my motto. even though i wish it wasn't. i wish i could be like those kids who when they got a project assigned in school, to run home and start it right away. i wish my brain would say, lets get all of this hard work out of the way so we can have fun and relax later. but of course the reality is my brain is saying, well since the project isn't do for another week that means i don't have to start it for another week, i can just sit back and relax until then. aaggghhhh! i always tell myself i'm going to change my ways, but it never freaking happens. well i know i'm not the only one with this problem. i know most other college kids puts things off to the last minute too. but dammit, when i think about it really pisses me off. i should have written this essay last week, but no. here i am, sunday night, writing an essay that is due tomorrow. it's just like clockwork. i always put off studying too. i really need to study for tests in advance, but i always wait till the night before to do practically all of my studying. a lot of times i wake up early that moring and study before the test. damn you procrastination, damn you to hell! it's going to be the death of me. i can just imagination how much better of a gpa i would have if i would just study more. things have got to change, or i'm really going to screw up bad. dammit. all of this writing about procrastination had gotten my thinking about my mom. i know she worries about me. she knows i always procrastinates. i wish she didn't have to worry about me doing ok in school. she didn't have to worry about my older brother. he was an a student. she never had to worry about him making good grades, because he always did. man, i wish i had his life. his a great job now, makes a good salary, and his future is extremely bright. now look at me. i'm a c student with and undeclared major. i really don't know what i'm going to do once i get out of college. thinking about that scares me sometimes. well it looks like my twenty minutes minutes are about up. let me just say it's been fun and i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this? i doubt it, i bet there just going to check to makes sure i've written something cause reading everyones in class would take a hella long time. what's up with the size of our class? i walked into the room the first day and i was like, damn! i've never been in a class this big. i feel sorry for the people that get to class only five minutes early, jeez even fifteen minutes early and nearly 3'4's the place is already filled up. classes just should be this book. well i guess that's all have to say about that. see you later.

" i am so glad it is friday. i am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town, so he is going to have some parties. i know it will be fun. i am also going to get to watch my brothers football game. he is a senior this year, and from what he has told me he is doing good in football. i only live an hour away from austin so i don't have a long drive. it could be long though if i-35 is bad. i just go north on 35 until i get to temple so i am happy about that because i don't have far to go. i also miss my boyfriend who i will get to see tonight also. we have been going out for 6 months now, which is definately a record for me. i sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me? all my friends and my parents also ask me that same question. i just tell them i have no idea. he is a real nice guy though, and will do anything for me. he pays for everything and takes me anywhere i want to go or do. i do not like austin much, but i love ut. i know that is weird but i'm not much of a city girl. i hate all the traffic and the weird people. that is why i love going home because it is out in the country. we have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings. it is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you don't have the sounds of cars or big rigs. i like the apartment i am living in this year. i have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun. they are also from a small town so we get a long really well. last year i lived in the dorms and i hated them. i lived in san jacinto and they were real nice for a dorm but i didn't like them because i didn't have a kitchen or my own privacy. it really just didn't feel like home. my apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger. well i wonder what i am going to do this weekend. probably go to cole's and do some homework and read. i want to float the river, i know i can talk cole into doing that with me. cole is my friend coming into town because his parents are out of town. he plays baseball for howard payne in brownwood. his sister also goes there and she plays volleyball, and throws the shot and disk in track. there is also a guy from my school that plays basketball there. i actually live in little river- academy. which is about 10 minutes outside of temple. we are a 2a school and we won the basketball state championship last year. it was an awesome experience. it was the first time we had won state in any sport. we got second place in 1998, we lost to krum by like 10 points. well i think i am going to take a shower and eat and then leave austin so i can get home in time to go to my brothers pep-rally. i talked to him last night and he said he was going to get to participate in the pep-rally so that starts at 3:00, so i'm probably going to leave in about an hour. that way i won't have to rush. this also seems like the longest 20 minutes of my life. i think i am going to have chicken strips for lunch and fruit punch to drink. i am very excited about next weekend. i am going to college station to see my best friend and we are going to go to ag-kickoff. pat green, cory morrow, roger creager, cross canadian ragweed, and other bands are playing there. that will be a lot of fun and i am real excited. i went on the big ski trip last year with all of them and that was also a blast.

"well another night of staying up late. i don't know why i don't really want to go to bed. i guess i just don't feel like it or i feel like i have to do something before i go to bed, but then something else pops up. i think i got used to not sleeping during my time in the army. kind of fun back then. the army usually pops in my head late at night when i'm on the computer because that's what i did in the army. i can tune everything out and just have the humming of the computer and only the light from the screen providing light for the room. reminds me of sitting in the track at 3 or 4am shooting missions. i wonder where i would be if i would have stayed in. i bet i would have gone to korea for a year then back to fort sill. i wish i would have gone to korea as soon as i got out of ait. those guys came back better trained than the guys who stayed in the states. i probably could have used that year being away from everybody. i hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. man i hate the rain. i remember in virginia i missed all the rainy days at school. i guess i got lucky it only seemed to rain on tuesdays and thursdays. i miss virginia. the leaves, the snow, the mountains and the lake right behind the apartment. man, everyday there was football weather. i can't believe they lost to byu last week. man i hate byu.

"well i'm finally getting around doing the writing assignment, i'm feeling relieved. i thought that for some reason i would not have the time to do it, actually not get around to doing this assignment. i don't know the reason behind that worry. hmmm. what do i write? well i'm getting tired already and i'm thinking will i be able to stay awake for thirty minutes to type all this??? i hope so. well i'm thinking about my classes and panic is setting in. i'm worried. i'm falling behind with reading material in my courses and not . my mind has moved to something else. the mcat. i realized that i had to take it this spring so i'm getting really nervous about it. i'm getting nervous now thinking about it. well my eyes feel really tired. i want to sleep. i still feel nervous and anxiety towards this semester'the mcat'medical schools'exams. i usually don't feel this nervous but since this year counts so much with medical schools i feel that top performance is . what's a good word? ummm. my mind is drawing a blank. essential? well good enough. i feel i must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well i don't really agree with that statement. i just feel i need to do good. i need to be satisfied. hopefully get a 4. 0 this semester. what else? i'm thinking what else i should write about? it's quiet in here. the fan is turned on. but its a huntington. or bay something. let me see if i remember?? nope i sure don't. well i didn't exercise today, which explain why i'm soo tired. i love running it gives me so much energy and makes me feel great. i love working out, but nowadays i don't have much time b'c i live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time that i just run at home sometimes, if i find a running buddy. the nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, i like that word its sounds so cute when english people say it with their english accents. i'm worried. again. actually i'm thinking about my teacher recommendations which is getting me worried. so i'm worrying myself now. too much of this is not too good. i knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, i'm wondering if it was psychological? well,, probably there was some psychological reason. woow,, i'm so happy i'm taking this course. its soo cool. i'm really tired. and bored now. yet i feel indifferent. as i was saying i think psychology is soo interesting. it seems really cool. the lectures are awesome. i'm happy. until the first round of tests. curiosity and anxiety well not really i'm kind of curious . i'm thinking about my friend. old roomie. she's in the corps at a&m and i'm worried about her. i wish she would quit because they are so ridiculous. their little rules are ridiculous. when people have to pee in their sinks because its easier to do than go to the bathroom that's when you have to worry. i'm still worried. she's a good person. but that the path she chose for herself. i'm hoping this will make me feel better. its working i feel better now. but i'm still worried not so much upset,,, i wonder how long i've been typ8ing? i hope long enough let me take a peek at my watch. yup!!! yes! its been 30 minutes i'm not sure if i did this right. i sure hope so. i'm getting sleep and i still have a ton of work to do. i think i'll sleep my brain needs to replenish the exhausted brain cells. well i guess i'll end this now and go to bed. one thing i noticed is that i was kinda indifferent not too emotional all through this because of my fatigue. well . good night. and sweet dreams. and as my old roommate would say. "" don't let the bed bugs bite"". i hope she pulls through.

"it is now 12:32 and so i cannot wait until 12:52 because at that time my writing will be done. i type slowly anyway so i shouldn't have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. i am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact i am hungry and stressed out. the first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. i am in college and at this point i need to get my priorities straight. i am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. my mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. i need a job, but i'm so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. i am not the proudest to be in a sorority. don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but i don't like the whole association that comes with it. my whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. in fact, i like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me? i love austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between smu and here. there are so many interesting people and i want to get to know them all or at least try. wow, it's already been over 10 minutes and this has not been too hard. i used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven't had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why i have been able to do this, and express myself so well. i enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why i write so much-journal, letters, poems. it helps me gain a sense of relief and since i don' express my feelings out loud too often, i need to do this daily, if not more so i can release all that i feel. i am excited about doing psychology this year because i hope to decide between the two majors i am struggling with. i am at the moment down for premed'nutrition and i really do want to go into medicine, but i've also always been interested in criminal psychology. it may be a little depressing, but i find it very interesting, and definitely want a job i love. a few months back, i read helter skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so i am hoping this class will help with my decision making. i guess we'll see. it is 12:51 now and time for me to stop.

"i can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the internet. she's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. it's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. they were all just blow off courses to me. i never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. college is different though. it's real. high school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. that is what worries me. i feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. i have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. man. i look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. i remember i use to think high school was important, but it never was. i always felt i wasted my high school years. i should have spent more of it doing things i shouldn't have been doing, not doing things i should have been doing. i could have had more fun, i guess. i did have a lot of friends, though. but, i recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think i had any friends. how sad, i thought. he thought i was a loner and made me name all my friends. i didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. it's strange. this is the guy whose motto is don't judge. he judged. everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. i guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. that's what's wrong with this world. society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. my friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. there would be no standards for good. that's very true, i thought. everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. that wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. we need all we can get. there are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. there are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. like recently, australia was overcome with huge floods. i remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. there was too much water there, not enough here. but this memory was happy, nonetheless. it was a strange thing that i would normally not have to do. i stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. the fish were sad. they died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. they were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. it was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. how strange. i'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. i guess that makes me a hypocrite too. no one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. i say i try not to act on my judgments, but i always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. in a way though, i have it better than others, i think. i don't see people when i think of them; instead i see the colors i associate with them. how strange, i always think, but that's how i really do see them. i can never see a person unless i actually try to look at their face and when i do, it's strange. it's not familiar. i looked at my sister's face, and even though i've known her my entire life, i was surprised that is the way she actually looks. how strange. my friends think i'm strange for that reason i think. i can't see a person, i can only see their colors, and when i look at a person, they don't seem like the person i know. because of this, i never look at people anymore. i forget how they look, but i always remember the feeling they give me when i'm around them and the emotions they stir up. i think this is the best way to think. i'm glad i can't see like i'm supposed to. i always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful.

"i have an aching headache and coughing every five minutes. i can diagnose that i have a cold because of my symptoms. the symptoms plagued me for more than 3 days and will not go away. this is very upsetting because i am planning to go tubing with some friends on sunday. if this sickness is ongoing, i may not go tubing. i'm taking a lot of medicines to relieve myself from this sickness, but nothing is working. my frustration is aiding the sickness to persist. there's one class i'm having problems in. the class is microeconomics; i failed both quizes and so behind in my reading. i'll spend a lot more time studying for that class than any others. i always have something to do but my sickness is preventing me to fulfil it to my best potential. i met a lot of people and made new friends in college; it made me have a sense of belonging that of which i lacked in high school. after me sickness is gone away, i know that i will have a great time and have a sense of directrion in life. my floor is so friendly and nice. we go out together and a maater of fact we went to olive garden last sunday. i joined many societys like the pre-med adn pre-dent societies to better my future and put me ahead of others.

" what to write about? i don't really know. should i talk about my fears of not successeding in life. of my fears of never finding the true some one. or maybe about the sadness i feel when i think about my past four years in highschool. the friendships i made and my heart that got broken more than once. or should i talk about my family. one of my little brothers that we have a connection that is so strong i miss him very much. or maybe i should talk about the hopes of a good year. or maybe i should just concentrate on my work here and forget about the emotional stuff, maybe that will help. i came here for a reason, to kae something out of myself and make alot of money because of it. i also came to prvoe and show off to people that i am some body. i don;'t really know what to say. my head keeps going back to the first person i let in my heart that ended up breaking it. why i don't know i got over him but when you hear that he has a new girlfriend it just hurts. but then i think i must lose weight so when i go back i can make him regret it. but what do i care he is not even thinking about the future. i want to have a good job with alot of money, with a loving and faithful husband, and two great sons. i guess i want boys becasue i really never got along with any girls. me and my sister really don't have that close of bond becasue she betrade my trust and i don't really know if we can ever have the same bond. however, i i do have a great connection with my cousin who is a sophmore in highschool she knows everything about, just like my mom. my mom knows everything about me too. people think that it is weird that i tell her everything, but i don't. i can't tell my father everything because he has this vision of me that i never ever want to disappoint him. he sees me as this smart girl who can do anything. i don't see it. i believe that i can make anything out of myself, but i don't know if i can actually do it. is it going to be to hard? i really can't tell. my dad says he will love me even if i don't make it but he says it is nonsense to think that i won't i have to prove this to myself and family and my so called friends that i left behind. none of them have really kept that much in touch only like 2 or three. am i being selfish to think that my friends can't even email me. but i am glad i left. most of my friend were under class men in highschool becuase the senior friends that i had were never really my friends i just hanged out with them once in a while and when ever i did i felt like such an outcast. i sometimes feel like that once in a while. but i guess everyone feels out of place once in their life. i think i just have to let go of my past and move on. i have to start my life here make new friends. i haven't even made one yet. i have to break out of my quiet shell and just take the risk and try to meet people. this is my time to live on my own on my rules, i justgot to wake up and do it. i have to focus on all my goals and then just do it and after i do this i should look at the end of the tunnel and see my future the things i am destined to do. hopefully they will be great and my life will have happiness and success. now if my roomate will stop talking to me i could write more. mut time is ending and i must leave now.

"excersise really does work. it does release happy chemicals. i feel reasonably energized now. but at the same time, i feel like it already peaked. its wearing off. jealousy is funny. chris and harvey met three girls while i was gone. i feel left out. i have a girlfriend, and i love her more than anything. i miss her. id give anything for one of her hugs now. but perhaps just the fact that they are meeting people and i am not is making me jealous. but. if they had met some guy, i don't think i'd be very jealous. its girls. i like girls. girls make good friends. i seem to have more close female friends than most with girlfriends do. i always thought this was a good thing, but lately, given my reaction to this new college environment im begginning to wonder if it is. im begginning to wonder whether i just want to meet girls, and have the romantic tension that will never amount to anything more. the romantic tension makes me feel good about myself. shouldnt my girlfriend make me feel good about myself? she does. but i always want more. it's impossible to do this assignment without sort of planning it out. i want music now. i still feel jealous. but while writing about it, some of it has subsided. i feel guilty for being so jealous of my close friends. in fact, my best friend. my roommate. i don't know if he considers me his best friend. it would flatter me more than anything to find out he did. if he ever told me. if i died, i wonder how many people would say their best friend died? i feel like im a best friend to many people. i feel guilty for this, because best friend usaually implies an exclusive position. now that i think back, there have been many instances where one of my friends would tell another friend that they were my best friend. i considered the friend they told my best friend. and i felt like i had done something wrong, like made the person who wasnt my best friend feel to close to me. i like close friendships, with anybody. i don't like going to parties. i like hanging out in small groups, or just talking to one person for a long time. i think i have made a lot more close friends this way than people that go to parties. i think a lot of people are jealous of me, because i manage to maintain intimate friendships with so many people. its odd how oblivious i am to this jealousy. im constantly insecure. i've questioned repeatedly how anybody could like me. i never want to meet anybody like me, i could see through them to everything i hate about myself. even as i tell myself now that people will jealous of me, im sure something will happen tonight that will make me forget that. when im jealous of someone, i don't understand how they could be jealous of me. i'm constantly jealous. for my freshman seminar on concepts of sin, we have to pick our own sin to write about. my sin will be envy. the one i can't control. other sins don't give me as much trouble. im a very restrained person. i think restraint and balance are more important than anything else. especially in love. i say that because i remember a word my teacher was talking about that meant to love your spouse too much. she said it used to be a sin, but its not anymore. it began with a j. i wish i could remember it. im sure ill look it up soon. its a word that relates to me a lot, and i bet i'll sound very smart when i use it. people will think im a very educated person who not only understands himself, but also uses big words to describe his self understanding. anyway, i agree that loving your spouse too much is a sin. my spouse type figure and me seem to have a mutual understanding about this. its odd how at times i love everything, and at other times i love nothing. i wonder if the aderall i take affects that. it seems to stimulate my emotions. sometimes when i take it late at night so that i can focus on studying, i start crying from pure emotion. heh, well, obviously not pure. harvey aays its okay to take because it was prescribed to me. i still think id feel better about myself if i wasnt on it. this band makes me feel better when im troubled. its odd, because theyre lyrics are very meaningless to me. but the music has this sleazy, yet upbeat sound that somehow taps into what im feeling. i wonder if they created this sound on purpose. i saw them live in austin, it was a fun show. i remember a drunk man who was extremely happy jumping up and down a lot and yelling right next to me. that was the first time i ever wondered if i should start drinking. i think i've still decided no.

"it is wednesday, december 8th and a lot has been going on this semester. i am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go. although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive, i know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school. the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class. with two test left, there was still a chance to make an a or b in the class which was expected. it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well, the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an a or b to get simply trying to get a c and pass. granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 10 different assignments and three test, it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left. the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to a's and a b's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an a on the other. my only focus has been on the two exams on saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered. all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right. doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues. it seems as though just when i try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up. this semester the fact that i was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something i did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but i still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation. next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a's which is very possible for me to achieve. making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now. all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong. all i can do is my best the rest is out of my hands. i have to do something to make it easier for my parents.

" this is the weirdest thing i have ever had to-do. right now my roommate is watching the graham norton effect and it is hard to concentrate. the show is really funny. he just changed the channel i am going to ask if could turn it down a little. yesterday i had a really good date. it is all i can think about today. i hope things turn out good because i don't want to be hurt. i went to the gym today. i like and dislike working out. i like the end result and the feeling after working out, but i hate the feeling before i have start working out. i want to go out tonight. i don't have class on fridays so i feel obligated to go out and do something. i got some people to go salsa dancing. nobody has really confirmed f they're going or not. i kind don't want to go anymore, but since some people already said yes i have to go. i am sure i will have tonight. this is really strange. i am just spilling out random thoughts. i really like the guy i went on date with. well i don't know if i like him or if i like the idea of being with him? i guess time will show. i am tired of being single. i want a boyfriend! i was at the gym and i felt for some reason really aroused. i usually don't get aroused at the gym but today i saw a really hot guy that i couldn't get out of my head. i wonder if that is bad thing to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys. i know it is perfectly normal but i would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to. maybe that's why people think i am whore. i m really sexual. i am really worried about getting in the communication school. i think about everyday. if i don't get in i don't know what i will do if i don't get in. i just had dinner by myself. i hate eating by myself. i think it is because i had no friends when i was growing up. i have friends now but tend to want them around to much. i want to have sex i hope ya'll don't read this because are going to think the worst of me, but at the same time i don't what anybody thinks of me. for the most part. i keep looking at the clock to see how much time i have left. i hope i am doing this right because if i am not than i will be really mad. my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes. he was just over my shoulder reading this. i told him not too and then he stop. he is watching seinfeld now i wish i could enjoy the show right now. wait no he is watching the king of queens. my mistake. i can concentrate now because i don't like that show. i have a lot of pretty friends.

" right now i am in my dorm room recovering from classes and preparing for an evening filled mostly with studying. my ears are receiving the wonderful sounds of jack johnson, jackopierce & dave matthews, and also ceili rain ( a camp allen classic). i can not say that i am smelling anything particularly because my sinuses are acting up after a game of soccer last night. i guess there is just something about the grass down by the lbj fountains that fires up my histamines. i am feeling a little anxious and stressed right now. i woke up at 10:00 this morning just as my first class was starting. this class is small and very much attendance based, so i could not simply skip it. i had to rush out the door and i believe that this rush has caused me to feel as though in race all day. the stress comes from the inability to finish a project for that class as a result of my oversleeping. i know the professor was not proud and i am afraid my grade will suffer as a result. i want to keep my grades up so that i will be able to easily transfer to any school because right now i do not believe that i will be able to cut it for 5 years in architecture school. for now i am committed to finishing this semester and evaluating things from there. my mind just wandered back to psychology class today. dr. pennebaker really angered me when he suggested that one of the greatest christians of all time and that spirituality and religion are all frauds and conjured up by our temporal lobes. he said that paul saw a vision of christ after he fell on the road to damascus because he probably hit or damaged his temporal lobe. well paul saw a blinding light that caused him to fall and afterward he was blind, which would not be caused by damage to the temporal lobe. furthermore, other people had received visions of what was to happen and to receive paul into their homes as a result of the events. there i've said my piece. i just realized that the music i'm listening to makes me miss my friends. one is called please come to boston and it talks about trying get together with old friends as this person is moving on with their own life. it has the same effect on me. i want my friends to come visit me on campus, but for some reason it would feel like a step back for me to go visit them. the other song is one from the christian summer camp i worked at for the past three summers. it just takes me back there with all of my friends and the summer love. we still talk occasionally, but only over the internet and not on the phone. i really prefer talking face to face if at all possible and then the phone and lastly the internet. it just seems so impersonal to talk on the internet with instant messages. plus you can not fully express yourself; sarcasm for example is hard to decipher when written. wow, i actually wrote for twenty minutes and enjoyed it. this was actually a little therapeutic to express myself like this.

"i just read in alfred adler's understanding human nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood. and i consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. now, i feel the only way i can attain happiness is to create something. to form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. i need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, i turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which i can empathize and understand. my hunger for reading is insatiable. everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, i want it all. i want to absorb it so that i don't miss an ounce of life. i want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that i can mold those after. and in all of this, with all the knowledge, as i absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, i feel great anxiety in that i have not made a contribution of my own. many projects that i saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. my passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. i can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. the worlds i put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness. i am always looking forward to what i will be, what i could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions. and it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge. and i think back to my early life. my parents. childhood. when everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that tv show that i've waited for all night. these were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. it makes me so tired to look forward. to never be now. my parents were demanding. good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. always left behind in someone's expectations. enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. i loved them then. cherished them. everything i did was to attain their approval. then i would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. an ovation of some sort. i need approval. i still do. my father was a loner, and now i am a hermit as well. he never shared his thoughts. compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house. i made up games to express myself. my imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books i read. the stuff everyone else hated. the big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. when people were still learning their multiplication tables. science fiction. fantasy. anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. and i wanted to escape. straight a's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. still not good enough, because no one would share it. they wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. i just wanted to be alone. with my books. my imagination. and i've never had a close friend, because i was always so afraid of betrayal. so afraid that i would be cast out, and many times i was, when i just wanted to think. now i don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. i hope for someone who can share my mind. someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.

"i have a ton of things to do. i still need that book for mis. i wonder what jon is doing? he's probably waiting for me to call him back. man, i'm so happy matti called. i miss her very much, i wish she still lived here. i can't wait to hang out with jon's sister and husband that should be pretty cool. the purple on this screen is sort-of pretty. i can't believe it actually feels cool in this house, it's always so hot in here. i hope you go downtown tonight i haven't been since school started. i'm always studying or i have to wake up so early. i can't believe i'm not swearing as i write. it's kind of a natural thing for me but i'm holding back in case who ever reads this gets offended. i think my mom's home i wonder what took her so long to get home. usually she is always getting home from work early. i wonder if i'm going to get a bad grade on this because i keep pressing return, but if i don't then i have to click the arrow buttons and that takes to much time away from my typing. man this is getting easier as i go, i thought i'd start typing and just go blank. why do people ask so many questions? i guess i do and i just don't notice it. i keep thinking of different things while i'm typing. days of our lives was so good the other day. carrie slapping sami was awesome i've been waiting for the day for austin to find out that sami was lying. lucas doesn't even like her anymore for not telling him that will was his son. my neck is starting to hurt. i would hate to have a data entry job, that would get so old. it's so crazy that i asked danielle about mariell today and they got in a fight just last weekend. i completely forgot about mariell until i saw her best friend the other day when we went tubing. tubing was a blast i hope we do that again before it gets to cold. i was drunk as a skunk. that food from el mercado was good or maybe it tasted good because i was drunk and super hungry. i wonder how many students from ut are online right now? i bet a whole bunch. i like this new desk my parents bought for me. it's so much nicer than what our computer use to sit on. i need to start exercising. i have a membership at world gym, and i pay $16. 22 a month and i never go. but if jon didn't work at nights then i would make him go with me. i hate going by myself, because it's so boring if you don't have some to talk to or if you don't have headphones. my headphones broke so i guess i'm just going to keep making excuses until i get my lazy but up and workout. right? right. well i'm pretty sure it's been 20 minutes so goodbye.

"my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from vivian. i don't want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and i have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while i was writing this i was thinking several different thoughts. i think it's not good that i don't respect vivian's wishes. i really admire her because she's so old. i am not as nice as i used to be. it's funny to think about writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. i still don't talk that much though because i don't like saying something about nothing. but i guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. james and i have been getting along really well. ever since i fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and i must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what i just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset i was, and i realized how much he cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because i don't always know what i want. then he makes it apparent that he's what i want. i miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when i have a really good person already? he makes me laugh and we love, which is most important in the person i share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and i will take it. james just has more than the average joe. oooo - i've already spent 15 minutes. i should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but i acknowledge my thoughts, and i can go back and read it in the future to see my development. i want to be a model or an actor. i want the spotlight. sometimes. i want to be a better gymnast. i don't want to be judgmental. i want a copy of this.

"this is my first year here at the university of texas and i am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. it is so hard for me because i have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. i have to find a job because i need to be able to pay my bills and i still have so much school work that i have to keep up with. at the junior college i attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. here everything is done over the computer which i guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but i just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. i miss my family, especially my sister. i moved here by myself and i really don't know anybody here in austin. i've never had to do so much walking in my life! i guess i should get all the exercise that i need walking back and forth to my classes. i'm worried that i won't be able to keep up in classes. i think i'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and i'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. i just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. twenty minutes is a long time to write. i never thought i would feel pressured to think. i guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. i still have ten more minutes to write. i wonder how these will be graded. i have so much to do today. i need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, i have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and i have a test i have to start studying for. i hope the test won't be too difficult. i always worry about the first tests in a class. they pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. if you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. i wish that all teachers would do a review. reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because i end up going over it again and again. i guess its really repetition that makes me learn. man, i still have five more minutes to write. i have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. i was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. i bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. there must be so many distractions for the professor because i know i get distracted just sitting there. in an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. i think that i'm going to like this class. it seems like it will be interesting and fun. i think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 4. 0 students walking down the street. my finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least.

"i have just returned to my room from my biology class. madeline forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so i cannot study them at the moment. i am very excited because i got a full meal for only $3. 00! i got a free coke, a free corner of a sandwich, 2 free candy bars and i bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks, which by the way was really tasty. it is in my refrigerator now because i have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago. well tomorrow at 3:30 i will be done with classes for the week and i am thinking of driving home for the night to lake jackson. it is a three hour drive, but i am not really homesick, just feel kind of lost. the reason i'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer. see the one i have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three dell representatives'technical experts the battery will not charge. so they have sent me a entire system replacement, after first trying to merely replace the battery. which is what should happen because when one orders a $2000 system they would hope it would work. so my next class is in about an hour and a half. it is biology which is interesting to me for the most part. it is my major, but i have been planning on changing it. i chose it mostly because what i was interested in was medicine and i wanted to go to medical school after college. now, i am not quite sure that is what is for me, although it was never a sure thing. now i was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where i could take more classes of interest to me and also spanish which i recently tested out of 13 hours!! i could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school i decide on. there are so many decisions to be made. now that i have finally chosen a college. i still am wondering about that decision. i mean i have always loved texas, my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer. maybe that is the problem too much?? i just sort of feel like i'm not fitting in, but then again isn't that what ut is about, being an individual? well, i definitely like to be an individual and my own self, but i would like some friends, a group who'll call and see what i'm doing, call to hang out. i mean i have been here only 11 days and i'm worried? well not yet, i am still giving it time. but i just feel so down on myself and anti-social. the only people i have really hung around are from my hometown. not that it's all bad, i just was so ready to branch out into something new! so going home just seems like a good answer at the time, i even thought maybe i chose the wrong college, but how can i say that when i've been here not even two weeks. at home, making friends was always easy. i was the center of focus there. had everything, here there is so many that i am, well, unnoticed. that in itself is a change. but then i think isn't everyone else going through the same thing? then if everyone else is, then why don't we just get together? well i guess the world does not work that way. but i have not given up yet, there is still hope. the first football game is saturday and i know that will reinforce my love for the school. i loved going to the games when i wasn't a student at this school. maybe i can meet some friends then. so it is labor day weekend coming up. mostly i need to be studying, but that is what school is about. i think we may float the river, so that will be fun. i have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight, but i have a study session for bio at 7pm, ,hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim, change and make it over to welch. i just am not sure how to work it all out. drive, walk, ride the bus. i don't live in a city and things are so different here. the town i am from, i didn't even live in the city limits. hhmmmm. but i really need to workout. i am not going to get fat in college. i need to lose pounds right now, not gain them. but food is everywhere, i guess you can see by the free food. well maybe i can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking. but the candy bars aren't good. ok, before next class i need to read some bio and some psychology, but what i really want to do is lay in my bed, listen to music, watch tv maybe take a nap?. nope not here in the college world. wow, i like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing.

"i'm looking at a picture of my best friend who is now in nashville adn i wonder what she is doing right now. i'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing at school at this very moment and why is every second centered around me like a movie or something, i think we should be able to take a sneek peek into others lives right when we want to. i've wanted to know why life isn't that easy. pictures are supposed to make you happy and remember happy times yet when i see them i just think about times that will never take place again because they are in the past. sometimes i seriously resent the past. i need to do my laundry and i need to put a different cd on the player because this one is getting old. i got two card for greg and i need to get off my butt and get the stamps. my mind is just full of things i need to do but i figured i would get this one done first, before i forget to do it later. i'm still hungry and i'm not sure if it is out of boredom or what. i refuse to get the freshmen fifteen because i'm happy with my weight right now. i like to workout and i need to do it more now that i have the chance right now. i hope my mom is doing well at her job right now. i also hope i get to go home for labor day to see greg for the first time in two weeks. i miss him so much, but if i stay busy it won't be that hard and will go real quick. twenty minutes sure is a long time and i don't know how long i have been on the computer, it seems like the internet and email are the only links to people outside of ut. i would call more but bills are so expensive. i need to make my bed before i turn into a complete slob. the chair at this desk is way uncomfortable right now and my legs hurt from walking. my feet are going to look so ugly after one semester here but oh well. i'm going to get stamps after finishing this, i can't wait until it gets cold. hot weather makes me so tired all the time.

"i am pretty tired today. i haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. i have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. i work with the youth group at the church i go to. it is getting very busy there as well. we are really trying to get the numbers back up. after the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. right now i am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. i was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. we are working construction on our new church building. it is very exciting. we have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. so for the last week they have been breaking through walls. it has been really cool to watch. my coffee smells really good. i am listening to some audio adrenaline. they are a christian band i just downloaded. they sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. i am switching majors this semester from engineering to a dual major in history and spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh? i think it will be good. i got accepted into the uteach program and so starting this semester i will be in an austin public school teaching and observing. i will be in the classroom starting next week. i am very excited. my arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. i think they are going to fall off. i have a lot to do today. since i am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. i think i will be pretty far behind in this class psy 301 because the co-op does not have the book(it is out of stock) they won't have it until monday the 8th. i'll just have to read a lot next week. i need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. i am trying to sell my truck. it is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. about 10 miles per gallon. i think i will put it on auto trader and see what i can get for it there. my coffee is done and it is calling my name. come. drink me. "" i guess i will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. i am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and i am really tired. i have to read six books for my history class. it's not so bad i have alreay read one of them and have started on another. the first was very boring. i think the rest will get better. this is a good song. i am also taking chem 302 i think it will be a challenge because i don't really remember chem 301 that well. i kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. what other classes do i have?. i am trying to teach myself spanish right now. it is fun. i think i can use spanish a lot later in life. i hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth'college ministry. but who knows what the big guy has in store for me. college age has a lot of possibilities. i am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. i don't know how that is going to turn out but i think it will be fun. this last summer me and a couple of friends went to colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed mt. elbert (which is the highest peak in the rockies @ 14,433) it was a lot of fun. i and looking at a picture of me and my friend chris. it is of when we went skydiving last year. that was a whole lot of fun. ""people may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". reads a poster on my wall. i read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. i would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches i would want them to say that i had a heart like david "". a man after god's own heart. "" that would be the testimony of my life. i pray that i can life according to the beliefs in which i so strongly hold. k2, everest, anapurna some of the greatest peaks in the world. i someday wish to climb all of them. but we will see how things play themselves out. i think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. the things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. and tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. the end ",0,-0.204284 -0.417541 0.622216 -0.063654 -0.724864 0.62178 -0.014802 -0.191765 -0.169959 0.791682 -0.202521 -0.217817 -0.342946 0.251685 -0.048197 0.0 -0.04277 -0.386631 -0.512427 0.851168 -0.311438 -0.209106 -0.552907 -0.671733 -0.211902 0.941103 0.001383 0.014417 -0.479071 0.445277 -1.100231 0.675532 -1.165998 -0.906028 -1.017959 -0.533287 0.007316 -0.425934 0.002952 -0.990334 -0.166731 0.003378 -0.188506 0.083523 1.034323 -0.119544 -0.859387 -0.587241 -0.663846 -0.344093 0.004142 0.41374 -0.228419 0.434885 2.040808 -0.31863 -0.469932 0.507888 -0.188392 -1.053015 0.564076 2.099968 1.589081 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.594978 -0.86676 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.184688 -0.37208 -0.17263 0.914496 -1.060561 0.945956 0.41695 -0.364913 4.578123 3.603386 4.720751 4.827727 4.419218,2168
"everything we experience is filtered through our mind, and if that mind is contaminated by thoughts, preconceived notions, or the need to continuously categorize everything our experiences become tainted. later when we realize the error, the experience seems somewhat lost because what it was abased on is no longer true. thinking about past experiences blinds you to the present especially when trying to compare the two. the past cannot be altered by the realization of a mistake, but it can't be relived at the same time. to move along, trusting nothing and everything, simultaneously and exclusively, through each experience, is to forgo all attachment, all security, all dependence, all crutches. the things that you continue, to do out of routine, out of habit is not something done for love. love can exist without any sort of routine if all attachment is dissolved. evolution involves change, change can catch you offguard but it is inevitable. to be strong is to change, to adapt to each situation and expect nothing. unmet expectations, grasping to the future, grasping to the past &#8211;all are causes of suffering, anxiety, and tension. to evolve is to transcend the suffering anxiety and tension and necessitates eliminating the causes of pain that reside in your own mind. people can inflict pain and suffering only if you let them, if your mind is contaminated by constructs. objectifying experience removes the suffering but also removes the joy. to cleanse your mind is not the same as objectifying everything around you. to evolve is to transcend the suffering and still experience. everything everywhere is constantly changing so if you hold on to it, its going to drag you around, but if you let go the current will carry you. kerbey lane looks really busy but we have no coffee so to flow with the current is to move through the lane of least resistance which only you know because the current is in your mind, it is your mind. the line between love and attachment is often confused and blurred because there is no line. you draw the line and you choose where to stand, but you can't be afraid to run around cross the line erase the line but you must choose. even walking the line is a choice, you cannot deny that.

" ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people i never want to talk to again. the shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. i hope i don't misspell too many things. i am sniffingly so loud. i should go get a tissue. i never did learn how to type right on this thing. why did my thoughts just totally flip? wow, that's weird. brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. i really wish i could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when i'm emotional. it really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until i can see straight. but i won't be crying any more hopefully as i am cutting off those jerks from high school. i don't need than, nor do i wan them in any aspect of my life. they just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. wow, london tell them how you really feel! i hate computers when i have fake nails. i always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. my back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. i think it's time to switch positions. ah. much better. now my typing skills really stink. it's really hard to lay on the ground and type. oh i have a laptop. that would be stupid to do if i had a regular pc. i still can't get comfortable. the floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. that's better. i don't know why i didn't get on the bed in the first place. ahhh!! yes, i do i don't want to be on my white comforter!! oh no!! you know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. you would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. stupid back gives me problems all the time. i miss dr. jones!! i don't know how i'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever i hurt. it just occurred to me that i might be using aim abbreviations in this writing thing. that might not make me look too smart. oh, well. i don't want to go back and look at it. it would just take to long. god, my nose is still stopped up. my skin is drying out to. i need to wash my face and moisturize. i forgot how to spell moisturize!!! i had to retypr it like three times. you know for someone who is supposed to be smart, i am pretty dumb sometimes. i wonder if pennebaker thought i was dumb in class today. i zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. i wish i could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe i could pay attention in class. but no. i have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. i seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. i was going to use a bad word, but i don't know if that would be appropriate. i wonder if it would affect my grade if i did write a cuss word. is that how you spell cuss? maybe i should have just wrote curse. and why do i always have to fix the word just? every time i type just without paying close attention i put an extra j in between the u and the s. it makes me feel quite stupid. time just ran out. i'm glad because i want to just go to sleep and forget about people i will never have to see again.

"i am running from something. from who i was and where i was. maybe not running from. maybe running to something. everything i see changes. my life is one constant storm, one sunset. i don't spend enough time thinking about who i am. i am attracted to things that are not always the best for me. i think i can fix them. i like to visit my past. sometimes it is nice to bask in something comfortable. i sit in your glow and warmth. i run to you thinking that you will wrap me in your arms offer me something stable. something that makes me feel like i know something about my life. i was thinking today as i was walking on campus that you are the only one i would like to run up to and kiss. then you come at me with your fists up and all i can do is shrivel and draw back. i loose the urge to hold you. for a minute. i wish i could shake you. i sometimes wish i could shake myself. just get out of my own life for a minute so i would get a new perspective. do you think i am wonderful? do you wish that i would let you love me? when i was running today i pounded out all of my aggression and all that i was left with was tears. do you ever have the feeling that anger is a mask for pain. i think i play that game a lot. hide what i feel. or maybe i don't ask. don't look inside my heart. too many challenges follow. i am happy though. proud of myself for the distance that i have walked and that i take another step every day. i wish you would stop me sometimes. grab my hand and beg me to say. tell me from your own mouth what your life is like with out me. admit to me that i am the light that causes you to have a shadow. you never admit things like that. too much pride to loose i guess. i let you fill me. i made you my home. then so much of what i thought we had and what i thought we were did not exist. very confusing. and painful to tell you and me the truth. i wish i had something beautiful to say. i wish i was the rain that washed down over the whole world. beautiful gray drops that just make you want to stay in your warm bed. they are comfort and beauty and a rare surprise. they can be gentle and subtle. or they can fall with a vengeance drench you make you remember things you want to forget. create a spectacle in the sky. lightening strikes my heart. i wish i was the lightening that struck your heart. then i remember that i am lucky. so many people never find what i have. the ability to love, be loved, lay beside someone. hold them, think them, feel them. i am lucky to have found people that will hold me with out making me pay them back, love me without asking when i will notice. with those people in mind i decide to get out of the life i live with you. focus on them. devote time to them. hold them in return for once. decide who i am and quit letting you define me. i think i will be happier that way. i think maybe it is time to let my light shine.

"i have a wondering mind so i think about a lot of different stuff within a short periosd of time. right now iim thinkigna bout home. i'm going home for labor day and i'm kinda excited. i really didn't want to go home but all my friendsa r o i might as well too. i bet my parents miss me a lot. thats y they send me e-mails oftn. its hard being the first to leave home. bc i don't want them to be sad bc i'm gona but i know they r. my mom cried all the way home i bet. she alwasy cries when i leave for long periods of time. u know that guy i saw at church the other day was pretty cute. i think i really liked him bc he was tall. its hard to fing a cute, nice, funny tall guy. especially when ur a tall girl. its hard being tall. everyone always says they wish they were taller and they'd give anything to be 2 or 3 inches taller. why? i'm tall and its not that great. true it comes in handy at times but its also a drag. its hard to find pants that r long and to find a good tall guy. i aslo get so irritated with people when they tell me i'm tall. i'm like hello! u think i didn't know that? no stupid i thin ki'm short! duh! i also get tired of it when people ask me if i play basketball. and when i say no, they try to convince me that i need to. if i wanted to play then i would, why can't they just leave it at that? would that be so hard? college isn't quiet what i expected. i thought it would be more fun, i guess. maybe once everyone gets settleed then it'll be more fun. right now all i do is study and work out, study and work out. its a visoiou cycyle. but its okay becaus ei am not going to gain 15 pounds!! i know thst for a fact. i won't let myself. if fact i'm going to lose 15 pounda at least by christman, i hope. i need to lose weight, i think. if i think i do, then y do ppl think they need to convince me that i'm thin enough? its my body y can't i do what i want with it? i want to start modeling after my first year at ut. thethat lady told me i could and that there company would represent me after i got the braces off adn toned up a little. well the braces r gone, thank god!! and i've already lost a little weight. plus my legs r pretty much all muscle. except for my thighs. they need a little work but thats y i've been going to the gym everyday. plus all this walking around campus helps too. geez this campus it big! luckliy all my classes are somewhat close. but i still get sweaty when walking around. man, i wish my schedule wasn't so spaced out. its a pain in the butt to have a 3 hour break. next time i'm going to schedule them better. theres not enought time to really do anything in those 3 hours worth whild. all i can do is study, get on-line and go eat. which is probably y freshman gain 15 pounds when they get here. u have all this extra time to do nothing and so they go eat. well i'm not going to do that. i'll go eat but i'll make sure i go to the gym later to work it off. i can't believe my friend jesss bought her size jeans and the next size up. she is so thin, she won't gain any weight in college. she barely eats anything. plus she'll be walking around so much that she won't gain anything, some ppl make me so sick. they eat and eat and eat but gain nothing, i use to be like that buyt not anymore. maybe thats y i stopped eating so much, i was afraid i'd gte fat' i dunnnno whatever the reason its probably for the best. i couldn't live with myself if i got big. i don't understand how peoipole let themselves go so far. i hate it when really fat ppl say they r tired of being fat but then they eat enough food for a small country. i'm like well. if u didn't eat so mucha nd exercised maybe u wouldn't be fat, ever think of that. that guy in med class is cute. he reminds me of a friend from home. he has the same humor as him, which is a good thing. mayeb something will happen with him, i dunno yet. i guess only the future will tell!!

"in the past i have always had a set of instructions to follow. on well, here goes. i guess that right now i was back, at the beginning of summer, sitting in my room in el paso, texas. this summer was really good. i got to go home and talk with my friends. in addition, i was able to do work and get my history requirement fulfilled. everyone wants me to go out and get a job. that's okay with me, but i don't really know how to go about getting a good job. you see, i feel that with almost 60 hrs of credit, i should be able to get a decent job. one guy i know is making over 50,000, and he isn't even out of college. i guess it's just easier for some people and not for others. i promised everyone that i would get an internship with a company next summer. that's kind of cool, but it is going to be a completely new experience. i guess i could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if i could get a job with them, but that just wouldn't be good. i want to be able to say, ""here is what i did, and i did it all by myself. "" i know that it's natural to want to get out from under your parent's wing, but it just seems to me that it takes forever. i have been blessed, though. i have done well in school, and fortunately i have a comfortable place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. sometimes it bothers me that i am more preoccupied with which movie i am going to go see this weekend than with more substantive subjects. there are people in this earth who can't even find enough to eat. wow, this is really getting deep. i don't want this to become a ""dear abby"" kind of assignment, so i guess the best thing to do is to change the subject. i am mildly interested in why this assignment was assigned. i have a certain hesitation when i deal with psychologists and people who are interested in psychology because i always feel like everything i do or say is being evaluated, and that bothers me. well, i can hear my neighbors (they just turned up their stereo system. )back to the subject at hand. i am not nearly so stressed this semester like i was last year. i guess that's pretty cool because i am adjusting to the whole college thing pretty well. at least now i know what is going on with this school, this city, and everything else in my life. i by no means have everything figured out, but at least i am not as clueless as i was last year. it is interesting to look around and see the freshman, with the look of panic in their eyes and realize that i was in the exact same predicament a year ago. since the brother of a friend of mine just moved to austin and started attending graduate school in engineering, i feel a certain obligation to help him. it is awful to be in the exact same situation without anyone to help. anyway, the guy is really cool, and i think that a really good friendship will develop. friendship is something that there is never enough of. money can't buy good friends, and even though people will try to replace friends with artificial benefits, it just never works. i used to know a man who had loads of money. this guy was really wealthy, but he was never happy. however, if you ever asked him how he was doing, he would never admit that he was unhappy. i guess that is really sad. to be miserable is one thing, but to be miserable and not really know it is something completely different. i think that it is possible to elevate your situation if you are miserable, but i also believe that it constitutes knowing that you are miserable. rrahhh, my neighbors just turned down their stereo system. thank god for the little things! i don't really understand why people are always claiming they are depressed. i've been through periods when i feel down, but all i ever do is call my friends, turn on the television to a program i like, go work out, or a host of other things to elevate that situation. i don't believe that 10% of americans need to be on prozac, or some other drug which makes you feel better. oh, well. i guess the only thing that i can do is change my own destiny. even though it scares me, it is kind of cool. i see so many people who are in a rut, and it makes me feel like their lives are hopeless. i know that changing is hard. i don't really like to change. however, it always seems that when i do, it is for the better. of course, there are those times when you change, and it proves to be a change for the worse. that only goes to reinforce your opinion that changing is wrong and you shouldn't do it. i believe that a person should experience all the things life has to offer at least once. that way they can say that they've done it. in addition, they'll know what it is. you know, i always feel awkward when i am in a conversation that turns stale. (i. e. the kind of conversation where no one really knows what to say. ) that really is bad. it seems like i have been in too many of those type of situations. i don't really know what the future has in store for me, but i am both excited and apprehensive. it is easy to look back on my past and think that those days were the glory days when everything was easy. unfortunately, those days proved to be no different than today. is that the way it always is? your memory improves memories as time goes on? if so, i can understand how the past was so alluring and appealing to many people. i know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is. that's pretty sad. i think that they need to start living today for what it is worth. that's what i try to do. i guess my 20 minutes are up. this was kind of an interesting experiment, but i am not entirely sure what the results are. i don't really know myself, and i don't know if it is possible to know yourself. there are so many different facets and sides to me that it would drive a person crazy to try to document them. i can't even do it.

"as i start this essay i am feeling a little wary because i am doing it a little late. i am starting to think about what to write. i think that if i don't write something intellingent i will come off as dumb or ignorant as to what i am feeling. i am also thinking erotic thoughts. i am also feeling embarassed for writing that down. i am scared that after reading this you will think that i am a pervert (which i am not). i am once again thinking about what to write; once again thinking that if i don't write something smart i will come off as dumb. i am beginning to think of friends from back home. people i left behind, family, friends, teachers with whom i had pretty good relationships. i am now thinking of a conversation i had with two other friends on a very private issue. my father comes into my head also, times i have spent with him after he and my mother seperated. then i think of times with my stepmother and how my mother would dislike it if she knew that i acknowledge her as someone related to me. i am now feeling a little anxious because i do not want my sister to come home right now and see that i wrote something about having erotic thoughts. i now am thinking of a girl in one of my classes. it isn't erotic, i am just thinking of what she looks like in the class and how i would like to talk to her sometime. then i start to feel a little down because i haven't made any really close friends in college yet, just aquaintences. again i am thinking about what to write. i just got an image of the capitol as it looks from the tower and i just thought about the tower. i think about going to mezes hall to sign up for an experiment. i am now worrying again because i haven't signed up for one.

"i'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment. it's only been 17 seconds, i have a long way to go. my stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, i wish he would go away. there's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. i wonder what we'll eat tonight. i'm tired of jester pizza. it's really not that good. now it's only been a minute and 37 seconds. 40 seconds. stupid kid keeps i'm-ing me. good now he signed off. my roommate is reading the fourth harry potter book and i can hear her turning the pages. she is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but i don't know if i should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. i've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. my sandal just fell off and i wonder where it went. my roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. i think it was soup. who drinks soup out of a cup? aren't you supposed to use a spoon? maybe we're out of spoons. that's no good. i'm going home this weekend so maybe i'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. my phone is ringing and i'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend keith but i'm not going to answer it. i'll probably tell him it's because i'm writing this, but i really just don't feel like talking to him right now. his new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but i don't really want to. i don't like being the plan b. i don't think it's very fair. the page scrolled down enough that i can't see how much time has passed. i'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes. does this thing stop when it's 20 minutes? now my roommate is writing something. my foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. oh well. i wonder when that water bottle is from. yesterday i think. my printer has a blue button. i'm getting kind of bored of this and i don't really like to type. i hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. why can't people just call you on the phone? it's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. now i'm staring at the wall. it's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. we tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. my best friend kristyn got a bunch of them for me. too bad she is not here. we're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. anyway, friday night is when we're going out to dinner. i haven't seen her in a week, which i'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when i lived at my parents house so i'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. she is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. i always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. i think if i reread this, i'd probably think i was crazy. all of this is pretty random. i want the phone to ring because now i'm in the mood to talk to him. he is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. i think this is probably a bad situation. he wants us to be friends. he is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. he is not a very good people person i guess. my roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. i have a pencil from the greensheet and i don't remember where i got or who could have possibly left it here. where did it come from? do people actually read the greensheet? i've never seen someone reading it. kinda weird. my mom works for the austin american statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in hr. time must be almost up. ha, it does tell me when this is over!

"ok, twenty minutes has started. well, i feel like i'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping i don't forget some meeting or instruction session i was supposed to go to. i'm thinking i really like ut so far and i feel i'm where i need to be. i miss my puppy, he's the cutest dalmatian in the worldi named him tex. he's my little childi taught him how to give me five! i wish i could go see some of my brother and sister's games, i'm sure they are kicking some butt. i've been thinking about the long distance relationship i'm in, and wondering if maybe i would like to date other people. i mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so i think i would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? oh well, he's in hawaii for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental u. s. doesn't count, right? just kidding. i'm glad that i came to austin, i get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. i'm surprised that my roommate and i are getting along so well. we've known each other for a long time, and i had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. i have a feeling or two to share i hate linguistics! i was worried about taking my spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since i was as sharp with it as when i took the ap test, but i'm loving it. glad i've been working out lately i love that feeling. this is the first year i will not be playing competitive volleyball, and i am definitely suffering from withdrawals. kind of makes me wish i had gone somewhere small to play. when i look at it though, i think i made the right decision. even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, i am really liking dorm life. this is cool. i want an apartment next year so i can bring lil tex down with me. speaking of feelings, i hate the phrase ""is it hot enough for ya?"" if someone says that to me one more time whoops, i guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. the sensations that i have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever i step outside! i loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. i plan to work out at least 4 times a week now, i'm just so sick of being the group fatty. my friend and i were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which i guess is good and bad. good because, i guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) i just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. that whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so i'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. well, my 20's up! hope it was good reading!

"hi, i'm sitting here in the computer lab at the fac, and it is dark outside and i'm a young attractive female. . i'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home. home, that's what i call my dorm these days. it's just easier for me. i want to have some established place to live and stuff that way i'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle. i used to laugh at lt when she called her dorm home. i guess i am following in her footsteps. although her strides are quite different from mine. and talking of strides, i miss cross country and all the guys. it was so much fun. i enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it. i wish i could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should. what went up came down and so on. i wish i could just see the fruit of my hard work as i did in cross country. the family atmosphere that i ridiculed and even took for granted at times. how could i have been so? i who loves others, i who cherishes all my friends. they were all my friends, all 23 of them. some more than others, but we all had that common goal that i find characterizes friendships. we were a sister hood. gosh, what a mourner i am, lamenting over the past. but they were good times. i'm sure, and i hope to god that i'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come. but this i can only hope that god gives me. for who knows tomorrow may never be. perhaps this is all i have. i'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet. i don't think i've done what i was purposed to do. therefore i'm not ready to go yet. in fact,,, i don't even know what it is that i was purposed to do. perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that i should be doing that i was purposed to do. who knows? who cares but me and my maker? anyway, i guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it. i guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do. i don't think planning is such a great idea. i don't think mlk planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college. i guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader. or so i guess. and whatever it is that i'll need to do will find me and use me for what i am worth. when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution. but it cannot be. mankind is not a prostitute race. or is it. i don't know. sometimes i think it is . other times i think it is a dignified race. but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration. too much more than it deserves. mankind is a fallen race. lower than the angles -which we should have been higher than. but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of god with the ability to tap into the supernatural'the unknown unlike any other creature. there is no intelligent life in other planets, we are it. now, i don't mean to say there is no other life forms out there, but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind. but then again what do i know? i who was born only 18 years ago? i don't know much, but then again, i have know a lot more than i credit myself. i have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry. there are things, great mysteries, that i knew even before i was born. but how is this?. oops my 20 minutes are up and that popup really disrupted my stream of consciousness!!!! what an ass!

"at this moment i am in the fac computer lab typing away among about 100 other students. being a freshman, these first couple of weeks have been very hard of me. i live at home and commuting, to me at least, isn't a problem. but to other people, it is. they can't believe that i do. they think i have no life, won't make any friends and will be stuck at home my entire life. which some of that is true. i do have a life, school! i'm not going to ut to make friends, i'm paying to go here to get an education and make something of myself. not to party on the weekends, get drunk, have sex with random people and ""buy"" my friends by joining a sorority. i probably will live at home during my undergraduate career. and why not? i live 15 miles away, why spend $8000 on room and board? i saves so much money. i have a big family, 7 people. my older sister will be going to medical school in two years, i plan on law school, my little school wants to be a doctor too and my little brother doesn't know yet. that much education, plus tons of other expenses add up. we could afford to live on campus, but i like my room and bed at home. we're hoping not to take out any loans for all my siblings and mine education, since taking and charging interest go against my religion, islam. but enough of that. my classes are going well, except for this class, to be honest. i haven't done the reading. which i better do soon, and i know i will. i've heard james is a good teacher, and i'm a great student, so there shouldn't be a problem. i know most people, especially freshmen, are too busy being distracted and having fun that all they care about is passing the class, or making a b. which is fine. i really want an a though. difficult to most people isn't that hard to me, i've always been in ap classes and i can handle working hard, which not a lot of people can, and not a lot of people want to. besides school though i have two jobs. one at tinseltown usa, and a box office person, selling tickets. and the other at kaplan test prep, as an student advisor. i hate the latter. i wanted to quit so bad but they begged me to stay since a lot of people are leaving. the managers are so rude to the students, which is so wrong because they are paying $1000 to come there. but i only work sunday, so it's all right. i don't have a boyfriend, which i sometimes wish i did. i want a companion, someone i can always talk to and someone that will listen to me and love me. it's really lonely not having someone like that. there are guys i would date, but either they wouldn't date, they haven't asked yet, or i can't date them. the can't category being one of my managers from work. he is the nicest guy i have ever met in my entire life. he's genuine, caring, goodlooking and funny. he deserves the best. he's only 25, which is 7 years older than me. i'm pretty sure he doesn't have feeling for me, and that's ok. i like the friendship we have now. i can talk to him about whatever i need to and he'll always be considerate about it. i wonder no one has taken him yet? i would if i was ready to get married. i've taken a few weeks off from my theatre job so i don't see him. twenty minutes has gone by, but i like this. i didn't to clear my head. it's a good thing there is a writing assignment like this. i almost want to keep a journal now, which i've heard is a good idea. i think i'm going to go eat now, and then go to an si for this class. :) ",0,0.663323 0.202119 0.984765 0.258714 0.019735 -0.020158 -0.484164 0.234068 0.05235 0.155524 -0.182335 0.178101 0.013423 -0.366654 -0.667803 0.0 -0.04277 -0.549546 0.021633 -0.117295 -0.008762 -0.742368 0.132417 0.325608 0.394474 0.685739 -0.397063 0.594993 -0.5127 0.354151 -0.43401 -0.129518 -1.115611 -0.906028 -0.482128 -0.753442 -1.440889 -0.781727 -1.100444 -0.145175 -0.499997 -1.01038 0.021765 -0.754881 -0.820655 -0.035429 -0.514966 0.203487 -0.188364 -0.131411 1.276496 -1.42076 -0.561878 -0.108881 0.510439 -0.857227 -0.846585 -0.352032 -0.108559 -0.282778 0.329011 0.114342 -0.054027 0.030348 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.118441 1.711 0.064449 -0.23436 0.176431 -0.194586 -0.337085 0.238428 1.02403 -0.451544 0.356439 1.181157 5.017056 4.011612 4.82031 4.863214 4.624668,1488
" my sandwich tastes really good! the pickle in it is a little too zesty, though. i don't think i'll buy those from heb anymore. i wish i had more time to watch tv. i really miss big brother 3, but i really can't find enough hours in the day. it makes me sad :( i have a latin quiz on friday, i don't know how well i'm going to do. i have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so i think i'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. that's the hard part! the paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. i get them confused sometimes. i'm upset that i went to college station this weekend and missed church. i really wanted to go this sunday, but instead i went to mass with my friend at college station. i had fun in cs, and i definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but i would have rather been back for the service. oh well, i can go on sunday. i start my job tomorrow!! i'm kind of nervous about that. i've never had a job before. what if i really screw up?? and what if i'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time? on tuesday and thursday, i'll have no problem, but what about friday? i work from 9-1, and i have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. i wish i would have just told her that i'd like to go into work an hour earlier on thursday and then i could get out of work an hour earlier on friday morning. that would have been perfect. but oh, well. what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . i took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!! i didn't think i'd ever finish it. i've only been typing for 6 minutes!! 14 more to go, lol. does anyone actually read these things? like, is it ok if i stop typing for a couple of seconds to take a bit of my sandwich? i think i'm going to, hold on. . yummy!! it's good, but those darn pickles. . oh well. what exactly are we supposed to talk about. what we see? or feel? or smell? or whatever. well, i'll tell you what i see. . wait! no, i'll describe my side of the room for you: on my closet door i have a movie poster of ben stiller's movie zoolander . it has a great big, lime green z on it and has zoolander written at tht bottom in purple letters. it also has ben stiller sitting kind of funny (i'm not sure how to explain it) in front of the z. at the top it says 3% body fat, 1% brain activity. i've never seen zoolander, have you? i just liked the poster because i thought it was funny. beside it, i have a movie poster of orange county. it has colin hanks on it with oranges for eyes, and jack black has an orange in his mouth. jack black is gross. . all he did the whole movie was run around in his underwear. 10 minutes up! halfway done. ok, back to my posters. the next poster i have is of audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany's, my favorite movie ever. she's wearing the black dress that she wears at the beginning when she's looking at tiffany's in the morning. remember that dress? she also has one of those looooong cigarette things, i'm not sure what it's called. *sigh* every girl should watch breakfast at tiffany's. it's the best. another poster i have is of rat race. everyone on the poster has big heads and little bodies. on the poster there's: i think his name is breckin meyer, he was on clueless, too. there's also amy smart, seth green, whoopie goldber, some guy who's name i don't know and can't relate another movie to him, cuba gooding, jr. , jon lovitz, and the guy who keeps falling asleep throughout the movie. he's my favorite. i'm win-ning! it's so funny! ok, i also have an ocean's eleven poster. it's read with white writing on it. in the front are the hotties george clooney, brad pitt, and matt damon, and in the back kind of faded out are the rest of their little helpers from the movie. beneath the title of the poster (ocean's eleven, hehe) it says they're having so much fun it's illegal. i think this is my favorite poster in my whole room. i also have a spy game poster on it. the only person on it is robert redford, and it says it's not how you play the game. it's how the game plays you. very cool. what else? oh! i also have a little picture, that is once again from breakfast at tiffany's. it has both audrey hepburn and george peppard looking in the window at tiffany's. she's wearing the same dress that she's wearing in my big poster and george is wearing a coat and pants, with a skinny tie. he has his hands in his pocket and is laughing abut something silly that holly golightly has said. at least, that is what i assume. i have been typing for 16 minutes and 50 seconds so that leaves me about 3 minutes left. hmmm. . what else can be said. i have to save some describing for later, i don't want to give it all away in this first time. what will i talk about next time? are there ever going to be subjects for you to talk about, or will it always be like a mad journal thing? i understand this mad journal thing, though, because what if you gave me a subject that i didn't really have much to say about. what would i say then?? so, i guess this is good, just mad journaling. . i'll think about what to say more next time, so i'll be a little more prepared and won't bore you out of your mind. 18 min. 48 seconds. . 1minute and some odd seconds left. 19 min!! woo-hoo. ok one more minute. what about this war gwb wants to have with iraq?? is he nuts! that'll be 2 wars (or at least fights) that we've had while he was president. how sad. 20 seconds left. what to say, what to say. . 10 seconds. well, i'll start my good=byes now. goodbye!!

"well, topday when i was sitting in the cafeteria, i was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, ""congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. "" that was kinda strange because i don't usually curse until i came onto this campus. i have no idea why. he asked me if i did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no i don't. i don't usually curse. the only time i ever did that was if i felt pain or something. i never felt the need to curse and i know that it's a filthy habit. i also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. i can't figure it out. i have noticed that i curse a lot and i've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, i don't really want to because it's fun. i don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion i came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because i know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but i don't care. i have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. i know that it's not but i can't stop sometimes. well, i can but i choose not too. . fire drilll!!! oh well. last i left off was awhile ago. i kinda lost train of thought. i don't remember what i wrote and i don't feel like reading what i wrote. now i feel kinda tired because i walked up the 13 flights of stairs. i wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. i'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. i'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, i'll be in big trouble. a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. i hate to pass judgements and crap like that so i pretend that it's all good. i don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but i did meet them here. i don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so i don't want to say too much. lets just say that i see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. i'm not sure what i'm suppose to write about. i know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am i suppose to write about. the first time i heard about this, i thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and i at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness. i wonder if i'm out of breath. would that effect how well i think. cause i'm writing this stupid assignment, and i seem to have trouble because i'm thinking too much about breathing. i always have this huge headache. i think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. i don't know. i don't care. actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because i can just write whatever i want and know that as long as i turn it in, i'm ok. no matter what i say or how i say it, it's all good. but, when i came in the room after that firedrill, i didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. i'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. i know i have to write for 20 min. and i have another 3-4 min. to go. i don't want to do this anymore. i'm tired. i'm not even thinking anymore. i got to pee, but i don't want to unless i'm finished with this assignment. man i got to pee. ok, i'm going to end this assignment now that i think i'm done.

" i just got home from my boyfriends house. he is so wonderful. we have so much in common. i love him so much. he is a christian and so am i. when we spend time together i feel like i am on top of the world just as happy as could be. that is how i am feeling right now that is why i am writing about him. i think about him all the time. when we are not together i wish we were. i can never be without him and not be missing him. he is just so funny, hes so cute, hes so wonderful. i wish he were here with me right now. he is caring and loving and we have a great time when we are together from when we are kissing to hugging to playing board games with his family. when i came home from his house i was going to try to send a card to my friend for his birthday, but when i was looking online for cards to send i was beginning to get frustrated that i could not find any that i liked so i started looking at other cards like pictures of cute babies that people had sent. i love to be around children and they seem to like me too. i hope to have some of my own one day. but that will be after college. i want to wait til i am married, that is very important to me. even though sometimes i have to admit it is not easy. me and my boyfriend have talked about getting married one day. i really wish he was here right now. but hes at the store with his mom shopping because she does not feel very well right now. i love his family so much. his parents are 2 of the most awesome christian people and the cutest couple you will ever meet. if me and my boyfreind do get married i want to be just like them. they have been married like 20 something years and are still completely in love with eachother like they had just started thier relationship togehter. you can see in in how they look at eachother how they talk to eachother just eerything about them. davids sisters are amazing too. they are truely a lot of fun. they are 28 and almost 31 years old. so they are quite a bit older than he is. whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that. i think they think we will get married some day too. i hope we do. when i first started dating him even within the first couple of weeks i could already sit in his house and picture bringing the kids over to the grandparents house. his parents would make awesome grandparents too. they are also really good with kids. his sisters would be really fun aunts too. his middle sister amy is getting married in december or january when her fiance gets back from germany with the visa. hes really cool too. i just got really happy because my boyfreind just sent me a message saying he was home but i had to say be right back so i could write more about him. he is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. it really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to god who is number 1 in our relationship. my christianity is really important to me. i was raisedin a christian home and brought up in church. i am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. they are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. we have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. she even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when i started dating david and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that she had a good feeling about this one. meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. and so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. i am glad that i still live at home while i am going to ut because i don't know where i would be without her. i am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever. the good thing about living at home besides free food an laundry is that my boyfriend also lives at home with his parents and he only lives like 5 minutes or less from me.

" i know this guy that lies. when i met him, he lies about himself to fit in. being the gullible person that i am, i believed all of his lies. after all, they're not that absurd--maybe they are. he said he worked at best buy when he was fourteen and had a cell phone. he said he was the on call technical support personnel. dan nguyen and i still teases him about that. i guess because of that, i didn't believe he got a new car when he actually did. his car is quite a looker. i wish my car is like that. it just needs a lot of work. perhaps more money is needed than work. i need to work to get money. i have no idea when or where should i be working. i think the work load of ut is enough to stress me out without working. if i work, then my free time will be taken away from me. i really cherish my free time; i could work out at the gym or play video games. something i never had free time to do. well i also have to read a lot of materials for my classes. today is september the 11th--one week from my birthday. i hate my birthday. bad luck always happen on that day. on my 17th birthday i got my first speeding ticket. three days later, i wrecked my car totally. september of 2001 was the worst month of my life. i guess i always expect to be happy on my birthday since it's supposed to be a good day. maybe that's why it seemed even worse when everything wasn't going my way. i love my friends. they're people who really care about me and my life. i do the same for them. i, however, do have a problem with keeping girls as just friends. in my opinion, friends of the opposite sex who don't really care about your life are just as bad as some person you had a small talk in the elevator. the only reason i have those so-called friends is because they're my buddies' friends. we belonged in a clique, a group, if you will, back in high school. i don't like the idea of a group . maybe things will change as life goes on. my roommate, jeff, and i were best friends in high school. we are roommates for almost a month now, and we haven't made each other mad. i guess that's a good sign. i heard about stories about sour relationships over something stupid. i have a mello personality. i can compromise.

"i guess i'll just start out by explaining how i feel right now. because of school, i've been feeling really stressed. although because of our class i'm not really sure what stress is. to me stress is when i have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. i haven't been getting as much sleep as i usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. i feel like my whole life is school right now. i live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. by the time i get to my dorm in between classes i have to leave in 30 minutes to get to another class 15 minutes away. the days have been going by really fast though. i'm always so busy. i try to just get my work done during the week so i can go out on the weekend and have fun. i'm really excited about college because already i've learned so much. i feel like i'm being able to think better about things. or i guess maybe deeper about things. not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. i've begun to think more about what i want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. i guess you sort of have to be like that at ut, because there are so many people. in high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. a lot of the classes push that during the discussion times i guess because the classes are so large. our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else i talk to have an even smaller class than i did. it's really weird but i keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. i know of 5 people that are in 3 of my classes. maybe it's just that i recognize them. i still don't really know what to expect from my classes. most of them seem interesting except for calculus and economics. i really like the experiments we do in class. ugh, i can't think of anything else to write about. i hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. so i guess it's sort of like a journal. i actually don't feel as stressed now that i've gotten this done. it's one less thing i have to worry about. now i have to figure out how to copy and paste it. i'm not very good with computers.

"why in the world do we have to do everything online? i don't have a computer yet pc mall told me that the one that i wanted would be at least a month because it's backordered. my friend is singing bad german grammar phrases. megan, lori, and i just ordered a pizza, and now we're worried that we will get fat. she's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. i think that i will party hard on saturday night but not as hard as on last friday. i got really inebriated and bruised myself in several nondiscreet places. lori is trying to dictate what i should be writing, but this is my assignment, not hers. megan smokes crack, and lori likes to hum really bad show tunes. lori, please turn the light back on. melanie just came in wearing an american outpost shirt. i think that this computer does not like me very much. this cure song is so wonderful. i'm going to poly esther's on tuesday so that i can shake my groove thing to some quaint 80s tunes. simple minds, jimi hendrix, aerosmith, boston, culture club, the gogos, theb52sthey're all wonderful! i think that i need to go shopping for some new clothes sometime soon. i should have brought my music down here. would i wear a black lace skirt with nothing underneath? probably not, but i wouldn't put it past myself. megan loves to hump monkeys, and lori likes to screw donkeys. the pizza man better hurry the hell up i'm starving! this room is really freaking cold (chilly is not cool). the music just got louder, but it's not any better. i don't think that i would look very good in a charcoal gray skirt. red is definitely my color. my radishes were growing mold, so i threw them out. old navy is for high schoolers, gap is for college kids, and banana republic is for the working world. how much longer do i need to type on this damn computer? i would rather write by hand any day. i think my eyes are glazing over from the absurd brightness of the screen. oohback cramps! my vixen red nail polish is chipping time to redo. random thoughts are running through my head. rings on my fingers but no bells on my toes megan has a rash on her leg. big bruise on my thigh. now i'm just making stuff up. are my 20 minutes up yet? guess not. when i start typing randomly, i don't make any sense. ladybugs everywhere. ska is fun. come on eileen. i'm out of things to talk about now it's all going downhill.

"well, here goes. i'm in my room right now and it's very warm. my housing is not air conditioned. i'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. i tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes i was kicked off. i was beyond pissed. my ankle is itching. yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and i sat in the grass. for some reason that makes my leg itch. i wind is blowing in my room and it feels good. i am very tired and want to go back to sleep. i took an hour nap awhile ago. matt came down. i hear people talking in the alley. one of them is a guy. i wish matt could stay here with me in austin. i miss him so much. i'm so pathetic. the tissue on my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. i need to call my tutors one day. i need one in math more than anything else. i'm not stupid or anything, i just need assistance on the problems sometimes. doug say's that i don't have a life. that i has no personality. that made my confidence soar. i know i didn't have a life, but i really couldn't help it. my parents are super, super strict and i wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. even now that i can i'm restricted to because of my boyfriend matt. he cam down tonight. i love him so much. he should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. he's mad at doug because doug wouldn't leave us alone today. i was kind of mad too. doug doesn't like the thought of me and matt spending time together. he's weird like that. matt should be nicer to his parents. they both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so i will too. matt is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. at least i had a close family. matt doesn't even think that his parents love him. i know they do but he doesn't think that they do. he still sees himself and their mistake. i don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. i'm going back home on october 4th. matt's birthday is on that weekend. saturday will be a lot of fun. after that i'll be going to the renaissance festival with matt and doug. we're going to camp down there. it'll be a lot of fun. doug can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. maybe he'll find himself a girlfriend by then. then he'll be happy. i think. he didn't seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into amanda. i didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one listened to me. i like my room it's nice. i live at the women's co-ops. they are cool. all the girls in the house have made me feel completely welcome. i've been typing for about ten minutes. i think that's pretty good. if y'all read this y'all will have a lot to read. i'm trying to type slow so this won't get too long. i'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. doug liked elyssa. he'd like to have her legs wrapped around him. he is very crass. then again matt can be that way too. he is rarely rude to me though. i'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. i'm used to being protected. it's weird being down here knowing that i can actually be hurt. that is scary. my guys live two and a half hours away. we won the football game today. the tower is lit up. i love ut. i love the freedom i acquired when i came down here. it's not that i'm partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. i just like that fact that i can if i want too. i don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. i've even been studying more down here than i did at home. i've kept up with all of my classes so far. i'll be doing some of my homework tomorrow. i read the assigned readings in between classes. the written assignments that actually take time get done at home. i have a quiz in math monday. my foot hurts. it's been reclining against the chair too long. my hand hurts too. it's resting on the edge of my desk. i am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. my legs are sweaty against the seat. the back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. matt left his bobo feit action figure with me. he's the bounty hunter from star wars. i'm very surprised because he's very important to matt. i am honored that he did. it's on my desk right next to my pewter angel'moon and stars figurine. i got that with matt in florida. we went to disney with the school marching band during spring break. the figurine cost me seventy bucks. it was definitely worth it. i've been typing for a little over twenty minutes. bye.

"i'm sorry, but i just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. where does that come from? what, is it inherited, or something? do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell? i just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings? i can't wait until it's my birthday. i can finally watch titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. leo. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure leo. ahhhh, pure heaven. i wonder how people like him handle their lives. i mean, i don't know what i would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. my life would change so much; i'm not sure if i would like it very much. i hate the media. they make so much out of the stupidest things. why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money? it just boggles my mind. it's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many ""smiths"" there are in the world. o. k. so, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. and, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. hell, even i do sometimes. all those sleazy magazines that say stuff like ""see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 20 arms and 5 eyes. "" crazy stuff like that. it's ridiculous. but, i must admit it is pretty humorous at times. i know when i'm in the grocery line, i browse over the titles just to get a laugh. i can't believe it's already 4:30. where did the day go? why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. it's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the ""time flies when you're having fun"" does not necessarily pertain. well, i guess it could. i don't know. all i know is that even when i'm not doing much, the days go by faster. that kind of scares me in a way. i have so much i want to do with my life, and what if one day i wake up and realize i haven't done a thing. i mean, what if i went to the doctor today, and they told me i only had 3 weeks to live? then, what would i do. i wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that i've always dreamed of. i wouldn't meet the man i am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. that's awful when people find out something like that. i couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. i still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 3 months to live, and he lived 2 years before he died. but, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning? i remember the last time he went to the doctor's. he sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. first of all, how can any one approximate someone's life? but, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 6 months to a year. he just shook his head, and said ""no. that's not going to happen. "" he said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again.

"i have never used julie's computer before. it's kind of weird. i don't like the font being used on this computer. i wish there was a way i could change it. i am also very irritated that i am still on the same line that i started on. maybe if i press enter it will start a new line. there you go. much better. i am kind of tempted to use this fan connected on the desk here, even though i am not hot. i just feel like using it. alison is funny. we keep writing each other email even though we could be sitting right next to each other. carrie is coming to visit tomorrow. i am so excited. chris said that he might come the next weekend. i am in love with chris. he has no idea though. i wish i could tell him, but i know that he does not feel the same way. he is always talking about how picky he is. i am certainly not his type. god i wish i was. i told him that one day i would be perfect for him. sigh. i can't wait to see him. i keep thinking of my exboyfriend. he has to be the biggest jerk known to man. the problem is that i don't think of the bad stuff, only the good. ok, this is driving me crazy. i don't know how this page has been arranged, but i don't like it . argh! someone just died in carries dorm last night. it sounds horrible. i would be so scared if someone down the hall from me was killed. i've got ten minutes to go. i can dig it. i don't really like amber. she gross. smokes too much. i don't smoke that often. julie just found one of jason's hidden cigs. it was funny. he was all saying, i've never seen that before. he's cute. today's his birthday. i haven't gotten him a present yet, although i know what i'm gonna get him. i'm sleepy. i almost feel asleep in biology. someone did and billie put the spotlight on them. i wonder what someone reading this would be thinking right now. who the hell is billie probably. that would be an interesting job. reading all the submissions. people's minds are fascinating. i wish i c could read people's minds. thoughts are cool. you know most of the time people are really thinking about sex or something else taboo. actually, i don't really know if that's true, but i've read statistics. i don't think about sex all the time, but i do often remember kisses, or picture myself kissing someone. i hope that's normal. kissing is so romantic. it can mean so much. how depressing it is to not have someone to kiss. i often feel sorry for myself. i don't think that's wrong. my sister just walked in. i was kind of worried that she would see what i was writing. is that wrong, to be writing about kissing. it is kind of personal. i'm thinking about dogs now. they are so cute. i really love baby animals. i can't wait to live in an apartment or house where i can own a mutt. i'd like to own a dog with chris someday. i think it would scare him if he knew how much i thought about him. i don't know if i really am in love with him, but i often think i am. if only i could be forty pounds lighter. i had planned on losing five pounds a month. i haven't checked since moving to austin. i don't think i've lost any weight though. i tend to eat a lot of cafeteria food. we are going out to dinner to night. i need to ask julie if she has a scale so that i can weigh myself. i wasn't to sure i wanted to go. it's with j and j and friends i don't know. i hope i get along well with everyone. i wonder if my train of thought that i'm typing is a good representation of how i really think. wow, i've written for 24 minutes now. those last ten minutes flew by. my hand hurts now so i guess i'll stop. i feel as though i should thank you for listening. thanks ",0,0.694081 0.975585 0.461102 0.871342 1.232507 -0.626897 -0.824805 -0.882234 -0.745097 0.337283 -0.250678 -0.590446 -0.19463 -0.381655 -0.703034 0.0 -0.04277 1.071527 0.617313 -0.160074 0.608206 -0.125017 0.736388 -0.261974 -0.146911 -0.727083 -1.041538 -0.359243 1.4328 1.325912 0.148169 -0.516424 0.660237 0.570765 -0.515925 0.224421 1.116736 -0.40566 1.194617 1.163545 0.47552 -0.002222 -0.10985 0.647606 0.567129 0.340221 0.26159 0.128222 -0.291123 0.837203 -0.229713 -0.414037 0.434968 0.417887 0.370986 -1.137854 -0.687809 -0.390017 -1.810078 -0.369973 0.185897 -0.796966 0.318351 2.887955 -0.185468 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.709819 -0.468084 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.205781 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.248902 -0.451544 0.069192 1.060257 5.189238 3.930092 5.162164 5.066328 4.945746,188

"how revealing am i supposed to be in this assignment? i can never track my thoughts. they always flit around. i am trying to think of something brilliant to write so i won't appear to be a complete imbecile. i just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. what am i thinking. i think i need to do well in college. is my studying enough? i mean really. i am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but i feel as if i have a reasonable grasp on what i am learning. how much of an expert am i supposed to leave each class. chemistry is going to kick my ass. i need to try harder. why can't i get it. my sat scores are so high but i can't imagine why. i'm supposed to be smarter. smarter than i am. smarter than your average joe. when i talk i am impressive. people applaud me and remark about me as if i'm brilliant. i'm not. i'm just good at bullshit. i think i want to marry my boyfriend. he doesn't treat me well. but i am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. does that justify the way he treats me? i cannot afford to think about him all the time. he will cause me to fail. or so my mom says. the minute i think of her saying not to think about him i do. how can i not. i didn't do this on my word processor first. i mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if i just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. my typos are me. i make mistakes. i misspell. rarely of course. i am thinking nothing right now. i wonder if other people do that. think of nothing. i think of a blank canvas. is that nothing? i guess not but i believe you can understand what i am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and i have spent together? my bed is too small. i want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. you can't have your cake and eat it too. hmmmm. i am so deliciously tired right now. you know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. will is annoying me. he has this dumb ass book he will not put down. i hate competing for his attention. asshole. oh yeah will is my boyfriend. i forgot to mention my honey's name. back to my tired. i just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. it is not really body fatigue. i just want to to go into my cocoon. something nonacademic. something cozy. it is mental and social fatigue which i suffer from. six more minutes. i need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. oh yeah. you can bet i checked the spelling on that one. today i was called the ""s"" word by another black person. sellout. will is white. black people hate that. do you know that in my entire life i have never had a true black friend. the black girls seem to hate me. they think that i am a snob. the black guys listen to the black girls. and i listen to my heart. i love will. i worry about him. being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. it makes him black and he does not get that yet. when he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. then he will leave me. it's all a matter of time. why would someone like him want someone like me. why would someone like me want someone like him. he does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. guess what its' been? 20 minutes.

"i am sitting in my suitemates room listening to them hang up a poster. i need to go and wash clothes, and i am also kind of hungry. i feel like i don't get out of this dorm much but what am i going to do. i want to call my grandma and see how she is doing and my computer needs to be fixed. right now i am getting bored in this room because its not mine. they really need a tv in here i couldn't go without one. with no tv and video games i would get bored very easily. i feel like playing pool but i am not that good at it, and it just frustrates me. my brother is the one who can fix my computer so i need to give him a call. haven't seen him in a while. haven't seen my sister in an even longer time, need to talk to her too. she always studies and her cats are really cute. every time i think of my sister, i think of her cats at the same time. thinking of her cats reminds me of when they were at my house, with my dogs, one of which just died. i miss that dog. we've had him i guess since i was in second or third grade, he was eleven, so that would mean we've had him since i was seven, thetas a long time, had a dream about him last night, him and my other dog brittany, who died a year before him. it always makes me sad when i think about those dogs. now the stereo is playing and it reminds me of how loud this thing can play, just hearing bass in my room. gotta stop hitting the wall when that happens. i need to go out tonight, haven't done that in a while, did my studying, now just need to find some place to go. i wonder how my dad is taking all his kids being off to school. haven't really talked to him about it and i don't know how to bring something like that up. i really miss my 4 wheeler at home, i loved riding that thing, i wonder if there is anywhere to ride up here. need to win the lottery so that i can get some more 4 wheelers. my last ride in el paso was the day before i left, with a friend of mine, who now for some reason i feel a lot closer to. its weird. cant wait until thanksgiving so that i can ride. now all i can think about is that my twenty minutes are almost up and i wonder what i am going to do after i'm done here. probably just kill time until i go and eat dinner. hope they have something good tonight, because the lunch menu sucked. feel like hanging out with some of my friends from home tonight, haven't done that in a while. ok, times up.

"the thoughts that are running through my mind at the moment deal with my studies. i am trying to do as much studying this week before the weekend when all my friends from houston are comming in. i'm having trouble accomplishing this because i haven't managed my time to have enough time to study. i'll go to the library for about 2 hours and feel like i haven't learned anything. aside from school, everything is going well. i have a boyfriend back in houston and we are working the ""long distance relationship"" good. he is visiting me this weekend and so far we have seen one another every weekend. i have been with him for almost two years and ever since i have come to college, i am worried it will not work out. he is 21 years old and doesn't have a successful future as of right now. he is attending a junior college, but he isn't doing much there and he doesn't set goals for himself. i am starting to realize the importance of school and my future. i don't want to waste years of my life with someone that can't provide a future for me. i went potluck this year at my dorm. we get along great. the only flaws i can see as of right now is that she is on the phone all the time and that she sleeps really early. it bothers me that everytime someone calls for mr she tells them shes on the other line and to call back. i cannot do anything past 10:30 in the room for i feel i am interupting her sleep. this is difficult for me because i'm so used to sleeping late and doing little things like playing on the computer or watching television before going to bed. today i only had one class which was economics. i don't think i did very well on our quiz today and i think it will be my hardest class this semester. i am currently in the college of liberal arts as undeclared and i am scared of not being able to get into the business school. i am positive that i want an office job. i am lookin into commuinications as a back up of business. it bothers me how people got into business school just because they were in the top 10% of their senior class, because i went to a ver competitive school with many smart students as where many of the students went to small schools or schools that i know i couldv'e been top ten in. i was happy to be in the top 15% in my school which took a lot of hard work. throughout high school i took an english class at a junior college and i just found out that the official transcript i had sent had no grade on it to tranfer for credit here at ut, so i had to call the college to send another one to ut. my dorm room just got painted and it still smells in here. the people in my wing are friendly. last night i went to an fsa meeting. here i met people the same race as i(filipino). this was interesting to see how many filipinos are on campus and a good way to meet people since i haven't really been associationg with people i've never met yet. i'm looking forward to play co-ed sports with this association and meeting other fsa members from dallas,u of h, and baylor. my older sister was part of this organization and she got a lot out of it. my sister has been an importmant part of my life. she is a motherly figure, but younger. she has been a great role model and is there for me whenever i need her. for the rest of the day i plan on going to the library and studying and going out later on tonight. i'm looking forward to this weekend. i also have to vacuum our room and do laundry. i went to church here in austin for the first time recently and it was very ackward. i have gone to church every sunday in the past with my family and it was weird being there by myself. i started to tear because all these memories of my family and the church arised in my mind. i've realized that recently i have been crying a lot. it's usually emotions built up in my mind of my boyfriend. he has been really nice and caring lately then he was when i was at home. i swam while i was in high school and was going to the gym at least 3 times a week. as i have been in college i have taken fewer trips to the gym. i have been lazy or too busy worrying about school. i have been gettin 5-6 hours of sleep lately. it's not that i stay up late, but its the fact that i am tired and can't fall asleep. i think it is probably caused by stress. i want to go home soon because i need to buy many things for my dorm. it's hard not having a car and being able to go wherever you want when you please. i am eating ramen noodles for the first time as a college student. i ate them at home about twice a week so i'm used to it. the food here at the dorm gets old. i get sick of the same things and same tastes everyday. i think i may be gaining weight. i really need to go running. our televison is finally working and i can watch my soap opera. i really miss my family, dog, and friends back home. in a way i wish i had stayed back.

"right now i'm thinking about the situation i am going through with my two roommates. school has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. i really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. i'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers i am beginning to encounter. i can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. i hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. i also miss my mom very much. even though i don't talk to her everyday on the phone, i can hear speaking to me with her heart. the same thing goes for me too. my classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. i don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. it really is a big change for me being here at a university. back home school was a breeze. now i can actually feel that i'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. the good side to that is that i like challenges. one of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to florida. there isn't anything wrong with that because he's ""in love"". i hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. i really care about him and i wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. although, i have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. my other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. i miss them all the time but i know that me being here is the best thing for me. for some reason i can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in san antonio because she is attending st. mary's university. there has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there.

"sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. i'm pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. i'm doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. i can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. i'm not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. i don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. i can't do it. i wonder what they'll do. probably not much i'll have about three quarters of i so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the rotc unit is good that way i guess i wonder how late i have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter i guess but i want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so i plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. i need to but i doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. i think that's time i hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing.

today was a tough day for me. i can't believed i failed to talk to asweenee. no girl has ever had that much power on me. its probably the sun kicking in. i can't wait to go to the football game on saturday. ut is definitely going to beat rutgers b'c rutgers lost last week to a weak team by more than 20 points. calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. i hope we get no homework or else i will be very busy wed. night. that phone next door is driving me crazy! why does kyle have the ringer on so high? i need to buy the bush cd soon. the songs on that cd will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to asweenee. i hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that i am not some weird freak. neal seems to enjoy studying chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. i guess he feels insecure about his ability in chemistry. i hope the giants win next week at jacksonville. it should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. who cares about the cowboys? tonight i want to email steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. maybe things will clear up the next few days and i will finally have the courage to do what i am so good at: socializing. i have never froze up like this in a long time. maybe i am thinking too much about screwing up. i know i am better than that. baseball season is almost near the homestretch. i hope the yankees can catch up to the orioles and go back to the world series. my parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. i wondering how linh is adjusting at rice? i hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing paul because i am not there to help her get through this hard time. i am glad i was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. i really miss her a lot but at the same time i know she will be fine. i sound like her parents. i wonder how craig's drive to minnesota is? his dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. this room needs more ac. ac. the idiot next door is blaring his music. spice girls suck! if he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. i think i am starting to feel the effects of the hunan chicken. that stuffed dog looks like snoopy. neal must be attached to this toy. ,0,-0.112559 0.638396 -0.912873 0.886331 -0.083724 -0.284809 0.642294 0.200316 -0.569293 -0.688899 -0.199 0.775859 1.383621 0.755872 0.85993 0.0 -0.04277 -1.16081 -0.973796 -0.466561 -1.153072 -0.742368 1.407204 1.31134 0.116978 1.120563 -0.029688 -0.833766 1.253377 0.731663 0.3539 2.829779 1.046937 0.240747 -0.23827 0.962065 0.596687 1.522974 0.982956 0.073757 0.529085 0.851643 -0.378059 0.289653 -0.10056 0.650511 -0.25168 0.925041 0.8494 0.561224 -0.65291 0.409627 -0.98649 0.83077 1.51663 -0.056736 1.964939 -0.954251 -1.480395 -1.037224 0.46119 0.478814 -0.480161 -0.18095 0.575612 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.186431 -1.364578 0.12731 -0.23436 0.913737 0.144463 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.183983 -0.451544 -0.037619 -0.868729 4.573479 4.118152 4.217063 4.557049 4.408867,163
"today is september 11th. i was reading some articles on msn. com about whether or not we should commemorate this. i had a class at 9:30--i wish i didn't have to wake up for this class. it seems like whenever i have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy. i'm glad that the only other class i have is in the afternoon today. speaking of which i'm going home for the weekend--that makes me happy because i will get away from everything related to ut austin. my roommate was in the room, he just left. i am writing on my laptop--it's very hard to use this keyboard. i am tired right now. i don't know what to do. i have calculus homework to do. i feel like it has been looming over my head. i can't wait to go to home. i feel more comfortable here at ut now. i think i'm getting along with everyone. i don't feel stressed out anymore. i feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about. i will find what i like to do here. i might join the badminton club. that sounds like fun because i used to play badminton and now i don't anymore. i don't play it anymore because i don't feel like it. being at ut is a lot of walking, i'm tired cause of it. i think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when i'm typing. i am indian. my parents are from india. they are very nice people and they are at home. sometimes i feel like they miss me and i miss them. i am going back to see them. i am getting tired of typing on the keyboard. i think i am a smart person. i wonder if other people think i try to act smart. i don't really care if they do. i'm just being myself. i get along with others. i don't think i will be completely satisfied in life thinking i have to be something when i grow up. i should just stay happy as i am right now. i think that would be a good life plan. just take it easy. that's what i'm doing right now. my computer is a dell and it's a laptop--with a small keyboard. i got it new. my roommate just came in. he is doing the laundry. i feel like he feels that he has a lot to do. it seems to me he likes to work. i am going to keep my life simple here at college. i won't expect myself to be a superhero. i think waking up for class is good because then the day doesn't go by. in college you have a lot of free-time. i think i spend too much time studying ineffectively. i should set good goals and then spend time making friends. i am very happy right now. i feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up. i have to get up to get the trash. whenever i do work, i think of doing it in sequences. sometimes i act smart. it's okay--i like to make intellectual jokes a lot. my parents used to take the trash from my room when i was young. they did a lot of things for me. now i have to do a lot of things on my own. that's okay--we're almost out of milk. i'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so i can just throw them away after using it. i'm getting hungry. my roommate is eating spaghetti from downstairs. that tastes good. am i being artificial? am i talking as if i want people to hear what exactly i'm saying. i don't now. bye ",1,-0.000107 0.908316 2.199927 0.460695 1.138526 1.495597 -1.487264 -1.480995 -0.81803 -0.041382 -0.233783 -0.3855 -0.97038 0.076655 -0.604885 0.0 -0.04277 1.342731 1.602389 -0.307802 1.607757 -0.505452 -0.147541 -1.061566 0.4746 -0.457085 0.941442 -0.753788 0.048741 1.336862 1.055667 -0.378078 -1.369212 -0.480975 -1.017959 -0.341564 -0.704697 -0.686812 0.078248 -1.249504 -0.457616 -0.740038 -0.814442 0.605672 -0.772755 -0.187824 1.71466 -0.732345 -0.938865 -0.406856 -0.317946 -0.20538 -0.859549 1.233845 0.250761 0.604642 0.907176 -0.304657 -1.138177 -1.759819 0.062516 -0.367233 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.216635 -1.143409 0.075315 -0.23436 -0.32584 -0.37208 2.512382 -0.422267 0.872446 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.72905 5.206972 3.760636 5.175674 5.622919 4.177314,2116
"there is this really annoying beep that will not stop, and at the moment it is the center of my attention, my focus. i cannot think of anything else because now that i have acknowledged this repetitive sound i cannot get it out of my head. it seems as though it is getting louder. i also hear the flopping of someone's shoes as they get closer, oh, and another person. each of them into their own schedule, their own life. wow, shoes all have such a distinct sound. someone just walked by with shoes that have a very hard sole and make a loud rough sound. the beeping continues. a girl nearby is getting a drink from a machine. i bet she's thirsty. i'm thirsty actually. i'm hungry, too. someone else just walked in the nearby door and a bell just rang. i hear some more clank of change and that sound of a drink coming down the machine to yet another thirsty person. as he came around the corner he was the same guy who just walked in the door but just left out the same door. i wonder where he is going, if he's a student. what kind of life he has, his interests everything that makes him an individual. more squeaky shoes. i seem to be hearing all of the shoe noises possible, as well as that beeping that still lingers in my ear. everyone has different ears. people are so different. i love ut because there are so many unique people, and a lot of them are very friendly. something just changed in the overall sound the air conditioner went off or some other constant light sound ceased, for it now seems much more quiet. i hear a man's voice in the nearby classroom who is talking about parabolas. oh, how i don't like math. it's like a different language to me, and it scares me to think of some of the classes i might take. the ringing continues. a man walked by talking to himself. i wonder if he realized he was talking to himself, or if it's just one of those things that people do naturally and then when you ask them about it they can't believe they do whatever that thing is. the ring seems longer as it still persists the intervals between them are about 5 seconds. it's thundering. it's sprinkling outside but it's sunny i'm waiting for it to stop so i can walk back to my dorm. i could just walk now but i am content just sitting here. the chair is comfortable. it's almost like a couch, and the cushioned back feels nice. now the coke machine in front of me started making that same noise again which stopped few minutes ago, aahh. i still hear the ringing. what is that? and the man's voice in the classroom. i can't make out what he's saying because of the other little noises. more people around the corner. my finger kind of hurts from writing so fast without stopping. i wonder how many muscles are working right now in my hand allowing me to write? again, another girl's shoes flop against the floor. the floor is orange tile and not a bright orange kind of burnt, how ironic? another guy walks by i wonder, too, where he is going. is he married? more clanking of change and ringing, but there is now nobody in the hall. chalk writing on the board it's an interesting sound. i'm thirsty. i'd like an orange juice.

"i don't know if anyone will read this or not. right now i have a huge headache from that survey. some of those questions are ridiculous. i am not sure how many people are scared of sleeping dogs. anyway, the ""gay"" questions really made me think. all of my friends tell me that it is a sin because the bible says it is. so i think i answered that question how they would of and not me. but i do feel that a gay couple should not be able to adopt a child. what kind of life is that? the child would endure unnecessary criticism. my boyfriend lives in oklahoma. i miss him so much. it is hard to watch everyone else be happy together. my suitemate is constantly with her guy. basically i am jealous. i don't know why. i never considered myself a jealous person. sitting here talking about relationships, makes me want to call him. my phone bill this month is going to be out of control. my parents are going to kill me. school- i am kind of worried about the whole thing. i never had to try that hard in high school and i was in the top 10%. but everyone at texas is somewhat smart or they wouldn't be here. i heard that texas had to accept around 3,000 freshman that were in the top 10%. i was at the bottom of that spectrum. i wish it would be 20 min. already. i am so tried. i have large amounts of homework to do today. as i sit here there are lots of people passing in church outfits. i feel guilty that i didn't go this morning. at home (houston) my family went every sunday at 7:30. my mom is weird. why would you go at 7:30 when you could go at 9:30, 10:45, or 12:30. she makes me so mad sometimes. last night we got in this fight over plane tickets to oklahoma. my boyfriend and i were going to split the price but she wants him to pay since his family has millions. she is such a snob. i never understood why though. actually i am surrounded by a lot all the time. i just finished ""rushing"". what an experience! i am so glad it is over. my time is almost up. i can't wait to stop typing. my eyes hurt and i still have that headache. i complain way to much. alright bye.

"i have just gotten home from a two and a half hour rehearsal for an orchestra that i never wanted to be in. i signed up for this orchestra only because i thought it was on optional group. but now i have been stuck in hour long rehearsals which make me very tired and make me get home late and then i have to do all this work and then i'm tired in the morning and am achy all day long. my left shoulder is killing me right now. it's from playing the violin. i think that i raise that shoulder and so then it hurts for long periods of time. i'm supposed to call jeff in 30 min. i haven't talked to him in over a week and i really miss talking to him. it's strange how i can go months without talking to him and then once i've talked to him, i get these urges to talk to him again. sometimes it seems as if he doesn't want to talk to me, but deep down i know he does. i don't know why i'm writing this in my psychology writing exercise, but it's what is in my head right now so that's what i'm writing. you've got mail is on the television right now. i like that movie, however i just saw it this morning, since every movie is on like twice in our dorm. i like taht. we get to see all these movies whenever we like. but actually it kinda distracts me from doing schoolwork. i really wish i could paint or make art. my roommate is on the floor painting a blue sky and it is beautiful. i really like modern art and she is all into it. our room is very nicely decorated since she is very artistic. i think it's strange how kinsolving put two freshmen, both from the houston area, and both fine arts majors together in a room. i kinda like it. it gives me an access to a ride home whenver she's oging. i've never done these stream of consioucness writings before. i kinda like it, but i'm not used to it. i feel like i'm making no sense what soever. i'm going out with this guy from my high school on friday night. it should be interesting, because we haven't talked all summer long and we used to be best friends. so it might be a little awkward. but i think it will be okay. i'm really tired of writing now and i think it's been 20 minutes. so now i get to stop writing and soon i will be able to call jeff.

"right now i'm thinking what i am going to write about. i am so tired and so ready for this weekend. i just worked four or five days straight and now i get the whole weekend off. so i am so excited, yet so exhausted. school is fun yet is hard to keep up with all the readings for every class all the time. i don't know if i doing anything right or not. if i actually understand what each class is going to be like or if i will succeed in every class. tomorrow i have a full day off with only two classes and the rest of the evening to do whatever. finally a night to do whatever i want to and enjoy the college life and atmosphere. explore what ut has to offer. i need to talk to my teacher that i am an aide for by next wednesday, when am i going to have time to talk to her throughout my busy schedule. all the books piling up on my bed. things i need to get done today or at least by this weekend so that i am caught up for classes next week. finally next weekend i will be abl3e to go home. able to see all of my friends that i have not seen in probably 2 months. i am trying to be as quiet as possible so that my roommate can study and do whatever she is doing without me bothering her. i need to go shopping for some food for my dorm so that i actually have something to eat. guess i'll probably go there tomorrow and find things that i will need and also eat. what am i going to do this weekend with all the stuff going on in austin. am i going to stay here or should i head back home? what should i do. guess i'll see what i feel like this when this weekend comes. gosh. i wish this time would be almost up so that i can get on to studying for my classes that i actually have tomorrow. i have so much to do yet so little time. hmmmm. this pink lemonade that i made is kinda tangy, maybe needs some more water. i just feel like i have so much energy right now that i could do anything. i need to make some calls to the people i have not talked to in a while and just catch up on everything that is going on. my ffet are cold. guess i better go put on some socks. my ass is also getting kinda sore from sitting on this hard wooden chair that the dorms provide. i probably need to get a pillow so that i can sit here longer. dang my room also needs to be cleaned. it seems like the dust takes only a couple of seconds to land and make everything look dirty. the blue rug sure is starting to look sad. guess i need to go borrow the vacuum cleaner downstairs so that i can get it looking better. the room also feels like it is getting colder. i sure need to go shopping. sooon. but i have no money. i need to get some money from my parents. how i sure do miss having them around and having everything paid for. the room is so bland and plain. the green ugly tack board thing could use some decoration. i wish people wouldn't have to come see my room on friday. maybe i won't be here when they come or maybe i might make it a point not to be here since at least my side looks pretty drab. my biology book is sure bigger sitting on the shelf than i realized. i sure need to catch up in that class since i really don't like biology. next friday when i get out of class i need to have my stuff packed up so right after i can head home. i can go visiting and then go to homecoming to see everyone. i don't think i will stay long, because i might feel awkward being in college and going to a high school football game. people might look at me weird. i don't like when people stare at me. i need to sign and fill out this form for my nursing class, it will be due pretty soon. i just don't feel like doing any of it. what should i do this weekend. its so confusing. what should i do. wow. i didn't realize all the room that i still have left on my shelves, i can still store a lot of more stuff on them. i sure have not played a game lately. i wish i could find someone that knows how to play dominoes, i really wan tot play dominoes with my brand new ones. i'm getting so bored, wandering around the room trying to think about other things that i need to get done, abll the stuff to do and so little amount of time to do it.

"well i am sitting here in my room and it's about 2:30 pm. my roommate is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. last week my boyfriend hooked up the ethernet on my computer. after trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. it seemed to be working, well all of the programs were working but when i went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. it said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key to terminate a program that wasn't working, well i pressed a key and the screen was frozen. what's wrong!!!! i restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. today i turned the computer on and it did the same thing. i called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour i finally go help, well i guess you can call it help. he couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for friday with someone who will help me. hopefully i can get this thing figured out. i just bought this computer a few months ago and it was very expensive. well enough about computers. i am a little tired. i had an 8 o'clock class, after the class though i came back to the room and took a nap until 12:30. i think that made me even more tired. well i need to start reading my english. i have a book i have to finish by thursday. i am half-way through, but there's still 120 pages to go. i hate reading! i read slow and it takes forever. that's not very good for an english major. i should enjoy to read, especially because i will be doing a lot of it in the future. i am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. this is a big change, i am very close to my family and it was hard to leave them. i am 2 1'2 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. i went home this weekend. i was glad to be home. i'm not sure if i like this place yet or not. i think it will take a little time. at least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. that's a positive thing. the bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. babies so they're everywhere under the sink. it is really gross. i never saw roaches before so i freaked out. the weird thing is that we don't have any open food, i guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also dark under there. we put a request in to have someone come and spray. they haven't yet. i hope they come soon! well my time is almost up. this was really weird just writing off of the top of my head. actually it's kind of peaceful because i enjoy typing. well i have my psychology class next, at 3:30 pm. i need to get ready for class. i need to check if they got the books in yet. last friday they didn't have the book in. well my time is up so i will submit now. until the next assignment. see you later!!!!

"the one thing that amazes me the most is the complexity of the female mind. at one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. if you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. the more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. the only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. true, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. no matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. i've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that i will ever be able to understand. the saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. i think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. the more you drink it in, the better it feels. you know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. the only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. the old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. it may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. that or it seems less pathetic. it's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. when i was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. my parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that i listened to, so i always told myself that if i ever became a musician, i would never include those kind of things in my songs. however, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. however, i wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of eminem. i also think that people overreact to his music. he is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician.

"what is the purpose of this? where is jackie? oh yea, asleep. i love that girl but she is driving me nuts with the pressure. oh well, who cares. i love my dog hershey. why wasn't she excited to see me when i came home today. what else should i say --stream of consciousness--bull shit. i am never fully conscious. why is banc one spelt with a c? i need to put some lotion on my hands. jackie sure did miss me. she is a great girl. i need another t shirt. going back to school on sunday. lots of homework this weekend. calculus is going to kill me. i am going to need a lot of outside help. a lot. pennebaker, what origin is that? psychotics. why do serial killers behave the way they do? will i learn that? i guess i should check the syllabus. jack would want this whole stream to be about her. she always gets what she wants because i spoil her. she is so beautiful. my momma knows me so well. she is a great woman. i wish my dad would get a job but not travel because my mom will be really lonely. that is no good. i kind of want to worry about sentence structure and grammar but i am trying not to. this is a really unique exercise. i have a really scattered brain. i can't concentrate on anything. i have a worse attention spell than dustin bell or even mark that fucking bastard. if he ever tries to get jack again i'll kill him. she is my angel. she sure did miss me more than i did her. i guess that is because i am to bogged down with other things, ie: psychology and this wacko assignment. pennebaker. i would like to pin a baker to the wall and beat him like raw meat until the blood from his ecoli filled body puddled around me. that was pretty sick. i think about shit like that all the time. why? am i weird for that? i guess i just have as screw loose. not like david does though. jesus, talk about chemical imbalance. that fucker has some serious problems. ever since the mushroom incident i haven't looked at him the same. crazy guy. and his mom is such a bitch, and his alcoholic dad, and his pot head brother. with his mom dying i hope he's all right. poor guy. its a shame he doesn't care. dave is some one that dr. ' pennebaker auto to analyze. you'll find some unique stuff in that crazy bastard. wow, what a nut. why are the keys on the keyboard organized the way that they are? some one is an idiot, but it all works out pretty well. will is a nice guy, but i don't want to go to his church groups. i feel guilty for leading him on. maybe i'll go once but that will only make the problem worse. immigrants are bastards. especially mexicans. i don't want texas to have more brownies than whites. that will suck. our native tongue will be worthless and the school systems will go to crap because english as a second language will be in the core curriculum. screw that. speaking of screwing, i wouldn't mind getting laid right about now. to bad jackie is on her period. i would definitely like to get laid. i guess i can crank off later, but it is no where near as good. maybe i can get a blowjob this weekend since i did come in unexpectedly. i'm so nice. i still haven't figured out exactly why i cam in. just a few more minutes to go. i'm really kind of enjoying this. thoughts on paper. that is how things get accomplished, no? well going to college is pretty crazy and at the same time pretty boring. a lot of good looking women in dobie. everyone in jester is but ass ugly. i guess it is good that i am not always surrounded by hot chicks so that i can stay faithful to jackie as long as i want to. i don't know what is going on inside of this crazy head of mine. who really cares? i guess the psychologists do. well, time is up. i guess i'll do this again in a few days. alright, later ",1,-0.179876 0.327495 -1.289083 0.350697 0.184696 -0.184836 0.113252 -0.048171 -0.349479 0.276697 -0.25482 1.124861 0.010816 -0.157113 -0.321387 0.0 -0.04277 -0.891544 -0.658793 -0.57916 -0.851041 -0.532165 1.053665 0.002249 0.350725 0.417544 -0.432693 -0.454492 2.52462 0.75187 0.812586 -0.496785 2.877948 -0.151773 3.084569 0.253066 0.234462 1.475844 -1.161169 0.440139 -1.038726 -0.056561 0.375922 -1.450136 -0.555444 -0.821411 -0.816652 0.135156 -1.232835 0.381092 0.250791 -1.116482 -1.374599 0.473775 0.607832 -0.240113 0.076467 0.198451 -1.267267 0.347723 0.231552 -0.232772 1.151161 1.852628 4.251812 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.374576 -0.38342 0.058516 -0.23436 2.144261 -0.37208 0.440818 -0.422267 -0.383389 -0.451544 -0.164658 0.715028 4.962016 4.201065 4.083508 4.279588 5.091062,460
"so i'm suppose to be writing my thoughts at the current moment. hm, strangely enough, i don't have any and usually my head is swarming with random ideas and daydreams. well, now that i think about it, i guess right now my thoughts are so scattered that i can't exactly grasp onto one idea. my friend called while i was in bio class earlier. stupid me forgot to turn off my phone before i went into the class, so imagine the embarrassment when my phone rang in a deathly quiet lecture hall. i quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone, not wanting to upset my professor. typically, i'm told, it's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class. but man, my heart raced after that. i don't know why either. but for about 5 min, i couldn't write; my hand was shaking so bad. so right now, i'm thinking i should call my friend back, but seeing as how i still have about 15 min left to write, i guess i can do that later. speaking of later, i'm still waiting for a phone call from my friend ruby so that we can go work out later. we went earlier this morning, right before lunch, but we had to stop short because i had class and all. we worked out for about an hour, and yet, that was definitely not enough. i never imagined that working out took so long. i'm terrified about the so-called freshman 15 that i want to do as much exercise as possible. it seems like i have so much free time on my hands, since i only have class for about 2-3 hours each day, and yet, i'm still rushing around trying to get everything done. it's funny how time speeds up when you're at college. i still have yet to practice piano here. and i have a billion other things to do, and yet, for some reason, i'm really bored now. my time management skills have definitely got to improve. fast. i also push myself to do something every single minute of the day, because once i start getting bored, then i get really depressed and start missing home. i never thought that would happen because i really hate port lavaca. it was so boring there. man, i'm just filled with surprises. i'm really looking forward to seeing my friend tonight. i can't wait. all my thoughts eventually drift back to him. i've managed to suppress my thoughts about him for about 10 min now. whew, that was really tough work, i must say. we don't see each other all that much during the day, mainly because he's busy, i'm busy, we're all busy. but i guess it's good. we need to lead our own lives, so in case things between us break apart, i won't be totally crushed. like the last time. i learned my lesson quite well. but still, i can't wait to see him. it kinda sucks living at jester without a car. sure i know a lot of people with cars and all, but that's different. i don't want to bother them with taking me places. i had my roommate take me to walmart today and i felt sooooo bad when we came back. i dunno, i just feel like a burden when i don't have a car. i guess i could always call up my bro but he lives about 10 min away and parking on this campus sucks. and usually when i go visit my friend, i get him to pick me up since he lives on the other side of campus and then some. but doing that every day is going to get quite tedious. i'm going to have to find another mode of transportation. i still have to figure out how the buses run too. i'm scared to ride the buses tho. i'm scared that i'll take the wrong one and end up on the 5th ward of austin. i wish i had my car. i've met some new people here, hung out with a lot of old friends too. but yet, i still feel very lonely. i mean, i'm starting to get to know my bro's friends but it's kinda not the same when everyone knows each other so well, and then this newcomer comes and tries to fit in. i guess a lot of freshman go through the same thing. i dunno. maybe it's just me. and wow, this 20 min went by really fast. i have about 4 min left. ok, so what was i saying? o yea, i think tonight i'm going to see my friend. (i told you my thoughts keep drifting back to him) it's his birthday today and his roomies are throwing him a special party, entertainment included. i don't really care about that. and surprisingly enough, i don't even care if he has a bunch of friends that are girls. i guess i'm just in a whatever mode. don't want to get too attached again. but on the other hand, maybe i'm finally beginning to trust him. i guess i'll find out later if that's going to be a huge mistake. i really like writing, esp like this. just random thoughts. i brought up my journal so that when i'm feeling some realy intense emotions, i can just write my little heart out. but that's usually only when i'm really feeling strongly about something. usually when i'm going through one of my personal traumas. ok, time's up. this has truly been fun. truly.

i feel kind of alone. i feel like i can't trust as many people as i use to. the people i trust are miles from me. i miss them. i miss talking to them everyday. even though we still keep in touch it's not the same. i miss my hometown. i miss playing highschool basketball. college is going to be hard for me because i never study and when i do study i can't study that long because i get tired because tired. it feels like my life is just beginning because i'm experiencing new things. i wonder if i'm going to meet the perfect girl up here. i'm kind of scared of this assignment because i don't know if i am doing it right but i think i am. i need a haircut because my hair is starting to get shaggy. i like getting haircuts. i'm tired but that's nothing unusual because i 'm always tired. i think i'm going to visit my home town this weekend. i want to see a good movie because i haven't seen one in a while. my eyes are starting to hurt because i have to stare at the keys hard. ,0,-0.163054 1.940912 2.658899 2.155025 2.634295 0.721687 -1.048765 -0.615337 -0.045528 -1.752948 -0.199869 -0.590446 1.410385 1.102096 0.679148 0.0 -0.04277 1.992149 3.035147 -0.024268 3.195781 -0.742368 -0.824536 0.622693 -0.624052 -0.776767 -0.616214 -0.610951 1.527205 0.613536 -1.100231 0.788916 1.574949 0.438278 -1.017959 6.175232 0.822102 5.420599 0.379592 -0.088972 -1.038726 -1.580765 -0.482982 2.430402 2.724836 -0.685675 2.853743 -0.936509 0.266673 -1.112506 1.093913 -0.155518 -1.788078 1.488281 -1.014793 -1.059021 -0.380906 -0.954251 -1.921823 -1.802701 0.874782 -0.625316 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.629798 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.777853 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.108754 4.682949 4.38059 4.9748 5.367149 3.839281,253
" i'm sitting here, listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window, on my balcony at university towers and i'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud. a better question would be why couldn't they attach it to another outside wall that isn't in the middle of my balcony. i've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life. on the one hand, i adore it because i'm from chicago and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here. if there was no air conditioning and i had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets, which i've noticed an insane amount of, i'd flip out. why are there so many bums here? i don't really know what to do when i pass them because i feel really really bad and want to help, but it's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they do with the money and why aren't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place. i just don't understand why they are so attached to austin texas. true, it's an amazing city, much of the reason i am here attending this school. it has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by. it just has the worst heat i've ever experienced and i don't see why the bums won't save their change for a bus ticket and go 300 miles north so they don't sweat to death in the heat because they can't buy water and i'm sure that's not what they'd buy if they could buy anything and i really don't understand how their bodies are still living. which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming. it completely ruins the balcony. there is no other place i'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl i'm trying to hit on than the balcony with an incredible view, but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and i sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me. i think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly. i can't really say why, but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here. the tv's on, we just got digital cable and it's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he can't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 15 dollars a month for the playboy channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it's soft core. true the girls are prettier, but is it really worth it? i think not. he's a bastard. all he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour. the kid doesn't move, he's a;ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is, no man, but it's cool, it's cool. the only time he's not sitting there bothering me when i bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 3 on a week night and decides he's going to study the one night that i decide to try and get some real sleep. there are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which i am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. when i inquired why he was doing this and let him know that i actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was, no, it's cool man, it's cool, i won't keep you up. as if it's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on. the time is up and though i wish i could go on, which i easily could, i'd like to say one last time that my roomate's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening, gentle creek out!

" i am wondering how i am going to type because i do not type very well. i also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write'type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know? today was the yr anniv of 9'11, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 11 as 9-1-1. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there. i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves) like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!! i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing. i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it? i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so i always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i? well i have about 2 min left, it wasn't that painful i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 20 mins went by really quickly 10, 9, 8,7,6, 5,4,3,2,1 yea!!!!! its over! not bad, eh? enjoy ",1,0.072587 -0.18285 1.262434 -0.205719 0.404536 -2.134798 -0.738875 -1.494543 -1.078289 -0.537433 -0.137664 1.097342 -0.390482 0.87385 -0.457192 0.0 -0.04277 1.224239 1.263111 -0.491389 1.200354 1.030477 -0.201126 1.720994 0.061051 -0.881442 0.305102 2.371273 0.763068 -1.010441 0.692283 -0.993213 2.232611 2.27465 0.784153 -1.109326 1.171521 0.608731 1.860153 0.037558 -1.038726 0.253584 -0.505368 1.164016 -1.429535 1.16087 2.408749 0.156422 1.470007 0.065366 0.5781 -1.337698 -0.154794 1.729143 -1.159692 -0.085376 0.281737 0.666057 -1.395205 1.54388 0.002484 -1.215725 0.666381 0.298132 0.490899 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.668869 1.669605 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.798902 2.015711 0.209649 -0.422267 -1.221032 3.032977 0.963796 0.510275 5.09383 5.022492 4.070208 4.297733 4.414054,1818
"well right now it's 10:50 and i am thinking i'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then i'll get something to eat, i feel very hungry it is probably because i didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway i just remembered i have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time i get home i am going to be so tired that i would just want to go to bed but no i have to cut the grass i guess i should forget about going to the gym today even though i promised myself i will go to the gym every tuesday and thursday. but o well at least i don't have to work today thinking about work i remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun i haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 6 minutes that i have been writing. i wander if i should return my study guide for calculus. i don't know if i need it or not. i am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. i don't know maybe 40 dollars. it makes the job easier but at the same time i have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free i don't even know him. i was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well i probably should give him a gift card of some sort. maybe i'll get one from work like a 30 dollar gift certificate. i feel kind of dizzy. i went to sleep late and then i had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 8:30 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that i had questions about. and now i have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. my eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. i don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun i have had so far today, but still i just can't wait to get out of here. but hey where am i going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no i am hungry i probably should get something to eat i don't know if i should call vivian see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. i could call lisa, i have to call somebody because i hate eating by myself.

"i feel a bit stressed out this week because it seems like my assignments are piling up. computers are not my specialty so i am glad i made it on this web page, now if i can only figure out how to check my e-mail. i went to a alpa kappa delta phi meeting last, which turned out to be pretty fun. i am so excited about the whole sorority experience. i hope i get a bid. this would be such a great experience - to make new friends. at this moment i am trying to get things done because i have a class in an hour and i have to attempt reading the wall street journal before 5:00. i would have gotten my paper yesterday, but i couldn't figure out the lock combination, so i called the wallace distributors and left a message yesterday. she called me this morning and treated me as if i were a child, speaking real slow and in my opinion she was patronizing me which i really hate. i think i am going to be nervous all week wondering if i am going to get into kdphi. my roommate and i are getting along pretty well so i am pretty happy about that. she is trying out for spirits and i hope she gets in because she deserves it. i am worried that it will be difficult for her to get in because 200 girls are trying out for 23 positions.

"last night around 11pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. she told me that a guy i went to high school with had just committed suicide on friday. apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which i had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. no one knew where he was so they went looking for him. they found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). it still hasn't hit me yet. i have been at school with him since the first grade. i know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. after last year i thought everything was going to be better. at the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) kyle committed suicide by hanging himself. after getting over that, will was killed in a car accident. after coping with will's death, i thought nothing else was going to happen. i mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. the rest of my year was going great until april. that was when i found out that one of the girls who i had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. she overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. i couldn't believe it. for years i would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. going to her funeral was the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i cried the minute i got there and didn't stop crying until days later. seeing her parents made it even harder. i mean what can you say to them. nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. nothing could make you feel any better either. she had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. i absolutely and completely fell apart. i couldn't see where i was going i was crying so hard. even now as i am writing this assignment i'm getting tearyeyed. i still don't understand (and i probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. i mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. marshall is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary'junior high school. everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. now i'm just wondering if the saying will come true. will there be a third suicide or death that i'll have to deal with? i really and truly hope so. i sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. when i first started this assignment i didn't think that i'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. this is kind of therapeutic though. i'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so i've decided to start typing about something better. i really excited to be here at the university. i really love it here. my classes and professors are great. i am worried'anxious about final exams though, but i still have awhile before those come around. i'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. unlike in elementary through high school in which every 3 weeks you got a progress report and then every 6 weeks came your report card. i'm also getting used to being alone a lot. sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. but then again you meet so many new people. well, my time's up.

"it is now 4:10 pm, that means i have to do this stupid assignment until 4:30. it's probably beneficial for the psychologists at this school, though. i think i am going off the page now so i will press return okay, that line was probably fucked up but that's okay. i wonder how long it will take to get on a computer tomorrow. it didn't take too awfully long today. i used to be able to type faster than this, i think. i am out of practice from summer. i can't write as well, either. not that i was very good to begin with. this is going to seem like a really long time. i was going to say take a long time, but it's only twenty minutes, which doesn't seem like that long in theory, but it really is. i am not looking at the screen and my writing is going everywhere. i wonder what the other people said, and if they noticed that this thing doesn't automatically scroll down as you type. it's good to do this on the internet because it saves a lot of paper waste, but it's annoying to have to come here and wait for a computer when i'm used to just writing things on paper at home. i wonder if jonathan had emailed me yet-- i will check on that after i finish this thing. doh!- it's only 4:16. i have a really long time. i wonder if he can tell whether or not people cheat and cut it short. if you can type really fast then you can get a lot done. i wonder how fast i type in comparison with everyone else. i should have learned how to touch type before i came to college. i still use the hunt and peck version staring at the keyboard. it's hard to do that when you're transcribing a paper or something that you aren't thinking of as you go. i'm getting tired. this reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa is rambling on and on and nobody is listening or cares what he says. ""ewww. what smells like mustard?"". i love that show. i can't wait until the new season starts. i wonder if we'll win the simpson's house that would solve all our problems for the rest of our lives. never having to do what we don't want to do. but it would be annoying to live in. i think you can tell a lot about a person by knowing to what degree he or she likes the simpsons. some idiots like my dad just think it's a cartoon, but it's really so much more. i should really finish that chapter that i didn't read. it was interesting enough, i just didn't have very much time to read. oh, i forgot some of my books, and i don't want to walk all the way to the dobie to get them. it's so hot! i'm so lazy. no wonder i'm a big fat cow, i can't even walk half a block to get my books. i should really start riding my bike again. i like the bus. it's so much easier and i don't have to carry my bike down those fucking stairs. i've climbed more stairs today than i have in a long time. i wonder if i'll ever be able to go running without dying-- i think i'm just not built for it. andy is so athletic, and i'll never be as fit as he is, and i'm really just slowing him down. yay, it's 4:26, only 4 more minutes. i wonder if you freaks are actually going to read all 500 of these things. yeah, what is the point of this stupid thing, anyway? i could see the point of that research project, but not this. you can't possibly read all these. m back hurts. i should probably try to have better posture. but i like to conserve energy. again, laziness. two more minutes. i'm tired, i think the sun drains all the energy out of me. i'm really sick of this stupid thing, and the minutes are going by so slow. it's really irritating me. i can' t wait to get to my email! i wonder how many messages i got in the last 3 weeks. well, it's now 4:30 bye.

"hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. i have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because i have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. i have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. i am also scared that by tomorrow i will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. i have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so i guess i should go. i kind of miss my room at home. it is hard to have to share a room with someone. this is the first time i have never had a room all to myself. sometimes i wish the room was just mine but i am ok with it because i know it is good to have a room mate. christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. i really need to work out but i cannot because of this sinus infection that i have. when i run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. how that works, i don't know. i was thinking about it. how can sinus fluid hurt your face. i could ask the doctor, but i am too lazy to listen to the answer so i won't. hmmm. whatever is on my mind. i really have a lot of studying to do. it is 10:00 in the morning and i woke up just to study. getting this done though makes me feel as if i have gotten something accomplished. i like that feeling of accomplishment. everytime you do something you get a check. chapter 1: check, chapter 2: check. the check feels really good. i don't know why it feels so good but it does. i am kind of concerned right now about the time. this clock on the computer is really off but i am using it anyway. i just have to time 20 minutes right? i have ten minutes left. i have rally never known how to spell the word minute. i don't even know if that is right. for all i know that could be the for minute(as in small) i even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless i was talking about music, it wasn't. so for now i just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though i just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling i typed it wrong. i am actually a good speller, i promise. i just get confused sometimes. this it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. i guess i will type about something interesting. hmmmm lets see. i really want matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. the one where is records every five minutes. (see there that word is ageing) i really would like to know what is going on in my life. so far this is what i think is going on but i am not really sure. i am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. i need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. i am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: i stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. i don't have a football ticket. i think i might go to fort worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. he is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. i thought i might cheer him up. it makes my grandma up set so i though she could use some cheering up too. and this is why i need to take the recording test. because i hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that i do not realize. it has been 20 minutes- good bye.

"well. steam of conscience you say. well as you will sonn learn by reading this i have a very random stream of conscience. i tend to jump from one thought to the next without warning. now some may call that add but i personally think that it is due to my intellect. i have always gotten descent grades in school and when i apply myself i get all a's, i just lack that thing called motivation. but i think that i am starting to gain it once again becuase of the fact that i don't know what i want to do with my life so i have to have good grades in order to transfer into the school of my choice. i'm actually looking at the psychology department as well as business. big surprise right? i just looked up and saw a picture of my absolutely gorgeous girlfriend lauren. everything with her and i is great. other than the fact that she is still in hight school and living in houston. (by the way that is where i am from). she is great. we get along all the time and she actually has the ability to make me a better person, where as no one else that i have ever dated has had to ability to change me in the slightest way. i think that was because i never really cared about any of them even if i did say that i loved them. (you do what you have to do sometimes. . you know what i mean?) back home i was a member of the high school band. really neardy sounding im sure but what can i say. thats where i met lauren though and if you saw her you wouldnt be saying that. but anyway that is where some of my fondest memories have come from. i have continued with the whole band thing in collage. my brother was in it for four years before i got here and talked it up to be this great miracouls thing but now that i am in it i am kind of wondering what all the who ha was about. i mean i love the music end and the free games are nice but other than that i am kind of lacking interest. please ignore the spelling errors i am a horrible speller. i depend on the spell check. well i just looked around my room at a poster of brooke burke that my roomate has on his wall. it makes me wonder if lauren is the only person that i will ever have sex with and weather i am doing myself a bad thing by not getting out and experiencing things. i mean i have been with her the last 10 monthes. don't get me wrong i love her and could never dream of hurting her, but i have to wonder what it would be like to be single in college. that alos makes me wonder weather i should feel guilty when i check out other girls as they walk by on the street or when i have thougts when watching a movie or things of that nature. man brooke burke is hot. i guess i am kind of feeling the freshman symptons that eveyone talks about. i miss being at home with my family. see i have never been to a church service or anything like that. i was raised on the principle of family. which i love and that is what i know but i have to wonder weather or not im missing something by never have gone to a service. my family is jewish. both my parents practiced when they were young and even when they were older, but once my mom's dad died (my grandfather) my mom stopped practicing because she did not understand why god would take such a good man a such a young age when there was a bitch of a mom (my grandmother) who deserved nothing that she had. so as you can see my mom has some issues with god and her mom. but this never being taught religion always leaves me with a void. i don't know weather i believe in a god or not. all i know is that i look at things logically and if there is not a logical reason for an action i have to wonder what is going on. wow 17 mins. don't know if it really feels long or not but either way i have to fill 3 more mins. looking to the future i need to start looking for some gifts for lauren because her birthday and our 1 year anniversary is coming up. which is a big deal cause i never lasted more than 3 monthes with anyone else. just another sign of how special lauren is to me. but more importantly my bday is coming up nad i hope to be getting a digtal camera so tha i can recorde the many addventures of collage. well times up so i guess i will be going.

"i'm supposed to be writing from my stream of consciousness. i guess i'll find out how random my thinking is, as if i didn't already know. i really like this cd too bad this is his only one. i wonder what cd i should listen to next. i should try to call janet again. i really want her to come visit me up her. i know how much she likes austin. i'm really glad that i didn't buy those tickets for the chemical brothers since now i have a math test that night. i wonder when the concert starts. i really do want to go. and the concert is the day after my birthday, it would be a present to myself. plus, i've been waiting 2 years for them to play in texas. i really like this song. this room is rather boring. we definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls. i have to make a list of stuff to pick up when i go home, otherwise i will forget everything and i don't know when i'll be going home again. i think i'll listen to semisonic next. i haven't listened to that cd in awhile. i'm glad i decided to bring the cd with me. today is deidre's birthday, and allison's. i should send allison a card. i wonder if kisha got the one i sent her. i need to get a prepaid calling card so i can talk to her. she needs to come visit me too. i should probably email her again. this bed is so hard, it's making my back hurt. but i have to admit, it's not quite as hard as the one i had during orientation. you would think the mattress would give some after having so many people sleeping on it. i miss my bed at home. it's so comfy. wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden. i think that this is one of the coolest assignments i've gotten in a long time, it's much better than all the busy work i had to do last year. my mom will be happy to know that i like my psychology class. i won't be talking about music all the time, i'll actually have something related to my major to tell her. well i think that's been my 20 minutes of truly intelligent thinking.

"so i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing with this. just typing i guess. damn aim. no one ever wants to instant message me until i start doing something. there are so many times when i am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. the minute i start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. all that typing and its only been two minutes. i have no idea what to type. can your mind really go blank? i mean, i want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because i'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously i'm thinking about something because i am typing this stuff. so my mind really isn't blank then. so i guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. my roommate is funny. i keep picturing her when i walked in the door from class earlier. she was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. how someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. its looked so funny though. i should have took a picture. i'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. i am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. ah. the new real world is on tonight. i absolutely love watching that show. all the drama. its interesting to watch. its kind of sad though i think, the way people love to watch reality shows. i mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. they film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. can u imagine how much film ends up on the ""cutting room floor"" as they call it. all the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. if not made up completely at least embellished. and its all because of editing. birthday. someone on tv just said the word birthday. i'm so excited. my birthday is a week from tomorrow. yeah! but i also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. and i have no idea what to get them. actually what to get my boyfriend. my dad is easy. a gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy. my boyfriend. i don't know. he already has plenty of cologne (did i spell that right?) so i don't want to get him that. and i always buy him clothes. i want to get him something different this time but i have no idea what. and he is going to be 21. lucky. everyone is leaving me behind. i am the youngest of a lot of my friends. so now they can all go out to the bars. without me. so sad. i still have a whole year to go. bleh i hate waiting. bleh. is that a word? i type it a lot on aim. its my way to say yucky or boring or i don't know. i heard it from somewhere though. i can't remember where. ha-ha. my roommate is up. i wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face. because it fell off when i came in. bleh. i am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again. i think we should have a fall break. kind of like spring break. i need my rest. its only the third week of school and i'm already so exhausted. i need a break.

"i'm not totally sure what i'm supposed to be writing about. i will be glad to get this assignment out of the way, because i have so much stuff to do. my classes aren't too bad, but there's just lots of outside assignments to do. i feel like i'm always busy, especially with being in a sorority. i love the one i'm in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. we have 2 meetings every week and then other activities. i don't feel like it's possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. i have been having a lot of fun, though. my mom thinks i party too much. she doesn't really understand that i do work on school stuff, and i do know that classes are the real reason i am here in the first place. i know that i can't go out every night. i don't think i'll have too much of a problem, because i can balance everything and plan ahead if i know something big is going on over the weekend. my seminar class is kind of annoying. it's a stress-management course, and i picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and i really wanted a seminar. everything's pretty much common sense. we have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. i do stress sometimes, and i always have a lot on my mind, but i don't let it bother me. i'm very organized, and i always find a way to do everything that i need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. my room mate does stress a lot though. she's always a little edgy and panicky. she kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. she kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. she's one of those ""the glass is half empty"" kind of people. it bothers me sometimes, because i like to be positive. i'd rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. i also don't think there's a point in worrying about something unless you have to. i'd rather just wait and see what happens. i really hope the guy comes to hook up the ethernet in my room soon. i've had so many problems with my computer, and i hate having to come to the lab. it's just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. it'd be more comfortable too, and convenient. my dad bought my computer when i moved in, but it had the wrong kind of ethernet card installed. now it has the right one- as long as james comes to hook me up! i hope there are no other problems, because then i won't know what to do. i'm so illiterate when it comes to computers, and i hate that because i don't understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what's wrong. i think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. i was kind of surprised. i wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the internet and just mailed to teachers. it's definitely less of a hassle. i'm excited about this weekend. i'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in houston. i really want to see corey. he's such a great guy, and i think i really hold back from getting too close to him. i guess it's because i knew i'd be moving, and i don't want to be attached to someone that i can't always see. it'll be nice to see him though. i might get to see one of my best friends too. she goes to sfa, but she'll be home this weekend too. i think she's having tons of fun at college too. i'm definitely glad i came here. sure it's big, but it would bother me if it wasn't. i'm having fun, and there's always something going on. i love that about big cities. i can't imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. i would get so bored. i guess it would be different if you grew up there, though.

"i am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. i don't know if i made the right decisin in coming here, i guess that's because people keep on asking me where i an from and when i say hawaii they all ask me why i transfered and why i came here, as if hawaii is so amazing and this place sucks. i guess hawaii is pretty amazing in some ways. but it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. added to that i don't like knowing everyone, well i like knowing people but i don't like it when you have no aninimity. i also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, i guess that goes without saying. i feel like i have to step up my game and almost go out ""hunting"" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. it's not terrible romantic, but i'm getting pretty desperate. there are some hot hot girls here. i don't know what's my problem, it's probably because i live in simkins which is on the other end of the earth. that's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. although it is a lot easier when your living with them. it's not so bad i've meet some women here, but the one that i am more serious with, i don't find myself attracted to at all. she's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but i really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. it's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. but i really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from hawaii. no i really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. i need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem. but i really want to go out with nicole, she is a goddess on earth, she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous. i can't belive it, and i act like such a dork around her but she doesn't seem to mind, and that's what i loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot, i must do eveything in my power to win her i must put the wheels in motion before she gets snatched up, because i know that if i don't act soon and i mean like in the next five minutes, some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what i see and i cannnot let that happen not this time, i've let that happen too many times in the past i've let every girl that i've ever had feelings for get away. and nicole may be the one, she's in the fricking pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that i am, but if i were with her i would not let that happen. i would do everything for her, i would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her. i have my mission, i must develop my plan, and somewhere in between i must get some studying done. straight a's and nicole that will be the story of my life for this year.

"today i skipped class for some reason. i don't know why i do these things. i know it is bad and i have nothing better to do, yet continuously i do this. what am i going to do with this major i have selected?. i don't even know if i what to stay in school. i want to work on my boat, and that is all. i need to finish the floors, fiberglass them. add the carpet, insulate the cooler. do all the engine work, hopefully the thing will run without incident. i need to buy coil wire, gas, carpet, foam padding, more fiberglass resin, collector gaskets, i already have the spark plugs. i hope nothing goes wrong because i accidentally hit the tab button and the web page backed up on me. if so when it happened i was five minutes into writing the paper. this keyboard is vastly uncomfortable and the next twelve minutes are going to suck. i am now typing with just one finger. i want roy to bring his boat out this weekend. we could use my truck to put it in the water so i can look cool. that is of course if i fix the bastard. i wonder if someone reads this. what if i were to type a bunch of curse words. how would my grade change. too bad i won't try this because my gpa sucks as it is right now, therefore i must be as courteous as possible. my hand now hurts extremely bad and i still have seven more minutes. now i stood up to see if it helps my hands. it seems to work as long as i use the one finger method. i keep hitting the wrong buttons. i wonder if i could sue the professor for damage to my hands due to this project? too bad the professor does not make jack for pay. i need to find a rich bastard to sue so i no longer have to attend school. if someone reads this i wonder if they think i am as sick as i really am. in case of technical difficulties my name is steve gernon. not that a ta would have the brains, oops sorry about that. at this point there is one minute and i cannot wait. it's the best moment of my life. i can now leave this god awful position and get on with my life.

"9:55. 20 minutes. time? why did i wait so loong to do this? well i didnt know about it until thursday, but still, what happened friday? oh yeah, i slept i think or maybe not it seems so far away. i guess its worth waiting since i got to see elise. god i sometimes feel like we are in competition and i keep reminding myself that it can't be like that. of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. i wonder why i have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since i've been here. elise i can kind of see because she is older and attractive but i would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. god i need to loose weight. why did she think i didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell i had? maybe she feels threatened like i do. i bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. i kind of want to skip the greek festivle because i am afraid. i'm afraid of being the odd one out. ok obviously i willl be like the only non greek. niko,. how i wish i was greek or smatter sometimes. i miss feeling loved. i miss feeling strong and powerful. although i do feel that way here sometimes. texas just isn't right for my balance i think. then again this is an emotional time of the month. but no i have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. i gues sits good to face, but at the same time i just want to crawl back home to paris. will i always think of it as home i wonder. god, sometimes the future is hopless. dear god, why do i sometimes feel this desperate? i know there are a lot of things i have done wrong, but i also know that i have been forgiven. lord, i love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which i can get to a church so that i can get the spiritual nourishment i need. i am starting to feel drained'. my father, jesus christ, please help me to help elise. help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. lord i pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. christ jesus please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. after vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. please help remind me not to give up, that mistakes are just that nad that i neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. lord jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because i know i don't have it. please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. lord i pray for jules. my heart is breaking for him because i love him so much. the thought of him tears me apart lord. i know that everything happens for a reason and that i am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when i see it and to embrace it willingly as i believe i do now. lord please continue to work in the life of jules. help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. help him to understand how i know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that i am able to experience any time. give him peace lord jesus from whatever may torture his mind. help eric and kate to find the same things too. to be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time? 10:16.

" well, i have to do this weird assignment for psychology. i think its neat, but kind of weird. that spoon full peanut butter was really good. i'm going to have to have some more later. the atkins diet is a bitch . even though you can eat all the protein you want. i still crave the bun on my buger. i was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room. god, i felt like such an idiot. then i went crazy looking for my roommate sam cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and i couldn't find her and i don't have her number memorized. i don't know. i felt stupid. i feel so fat. !!!! even though i'm not overweight at all i just feel fat . i have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time. i thinks obsessive compulsive or something. i feel like i always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place. i guess i always feel like i have to impress everyone. shut up sam, god she makes the most annoying sounds i've ever heard. anyway. yeah i just always feel fat. i think i way around 123 and i'm 5""1. i just want be a little bit thinner maybe 5 or 7 pounds lighter. well, i'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits, and i feel like i got to loose a few. they are awesome, but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we've just grown to be the best of friends. i'm only 18, and its weird cause one of them is 42 and the other is 30. i'm so excited cause i miss them a lot. i think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 6 hours to come and visit. when i went down a couple of weeks ago back home, they took me out to south padre island and we all got wasted. i like it cause i can trust them and more importantly they can trust me. i have a little head ache right now. i wonder if it was the peanut butter. i hope not. i'm really thirsty. all i've been drinking is water cause of that diet. i just started it yesterday and i probably won't see any results till maybe in a few more days. i miss isaiah. i love him so much, but he's about 6 hours away and a senior in high school. i love him but the last time i went down i didn't feel the same love for him like i used to. maybe i'm just in love with the image of him. i guess that can happen. i've been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person i am. i wanted to come to ut because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you. well, i still don't know who i am. i know that i'm sweet, kind, and talented, but there's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that i don't get into trouble. maybe everyone does that. i guess i'll never know. i 'm really glad that i have a good roommate. we are exactly alike and we get along really well. i just miss everyone from back home , but i know when pam and kristy come to visit me i'll feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and i m so in love with her music. i recently went to a sarah mclachlan concert on july 23 this summer. now that was probably the best experience of my life. it was awesome. their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches, i think that's how you spell it. i 'm really excited to meet her cause she's hilarious. i spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and i haven't met her in person yet, but i'm looking foward to it cause she said she likes having a good time and i'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together. i can't wait!!!!1. i'm tired now. i haven't gotten any sleep since i'v been here, wow the times almost running out,, ",1,-0.172207 1.113994 -0.558235 1.326526 1.441398 0.392513 -0.919658 -0.853837 -0.730431 0.45467 -0.175018 -0.590446 -0.716232 -0.102451 -1.41641 0.0 -0.04277 1.03342 0.686598 0.62916 0.893842 0.246277 0.650179 -0.973724 -0.165587 0.013386 -0.774753 0.435947 1.801114 2.038375 1.298841 1.205129 0.419923 0.512961 -0.294384 -0.148169 -1.024038 1.053038 -0.477825 -1.139639 -0.068742 0.642299 0.648524 0.814179 0.214904 -0.638065 1.510588 0.263167 -0.167536 0.868478 -0.702863 -0.344285 0.598018 -0.555921 -1.157643 -0.677717 -0.744017 0.130046 0.244309 -0.794237 0.474075 -0.313916 0.287096 1.000274 -0.199612 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.178125 -0.134002 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.906233 -0.337085 -0.124871 0.982605 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.333918 5.303599 3.901139 5.219847 4.961818 4.538259,2338
" hi, my name is ashlee vicars and i am a new student at the university of texas in austin. i absolutely love it here! it is so much more than i expected. i am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here. i didn't know anyone here when i came so i decided to go through the rush process and go greek. i was very disappointd in the greek system. they are so political here in austin. i felt like i was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents didn't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush. a lot of the legacy stuff didn't make sense to me. oh well, i ended up pledging alpha chiomega and i absolutely love it ! the sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun! i have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already. right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and i am typing this for my new psych class. i am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend. we were together for the past year and i was so in love with him, but he was 21 and i was 18 and that 's not a bad age difference, but he just wanted to party all of the time, which is okay, but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me. that also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so i broke up with him. but i still miss him so much. but moving to austin is a good thing for me because i am away from everyithing from back home and i can start all over. he wasn't good for me at the time. hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out, but until then i am not putting up with that and i can do better. i love the new girls in my sorority, they are so sweet! it made me think of that because a new friend of mine jill, knew jacob, my x-boyfriend, and they were friends their senior year. its knda crazy becasue i am from pottsboro, an hour north of dallas, she is from plano, and he is from prosper. i met jacob at the lake when i was modeling for a swimsuit store. we fell in love and spent the next year together. anyways, i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me. everytime i talk to them they arelik how are yoyr grades? when it has only been 2 weeks and this is like the first assisnment i have turned in. they are so worried that i am just down here partying and not going to class. i don't know why they think that because coming to ut has been a dream of mine since i was a little girl! i am so happy here! my mom got upset with me last night becasue i told her i was going to the tulane vs. texas game in new orleans and she said no, and i said well i'm old enought to make my own decisions now. why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun? and then i was going to eat dinner at 10:00 at night and she flipped out on me because i had class the next day. she is being unreal. and i havne't talked to my dad in over a week because we just argue about how i should be using my time wisely at college. i don't even want to go home and visit anymore. i have always had a good relationship with both of myparents so i don't know why now it is a problem. i love them to death but i just can't talk to them for a couple of days. my roommate is cool, but she sometimes gets on my nerves. she never cleans up after hersolf and she always has one of her two boyfriend over here (that don't know about one another) and she is sleeping with both of them and then asks me to cover for her. but at the same time she is doing their laundry here and being inconsiderate of me. i don;'t know, i'm just really stressed out right now. my new friends here ar eawesome though. i guess i keep talking about them because this is the first time in 7 years that i havene't had a serious boyfriend. but i like the single life sometimes, i don't have to answer to anybody or call in and check in with anyone anymore. my friends just fight with their boyriends all of the time. i came from a small town where you were able to be involved in everything. i played basketball, ran track, softball, was a cheerleader all thourhg school, did student council, sisters of service, fellowship of christian athletes, and took a few leadership roles and it was great. but a lot of girls hated me for it. i was alway ssweet to everyone but the girls always taked bad about me because i was friends with their boyfriends or was with the guy they wantred. now that i am in ausitn, i don't have to worry about jelaous girls anymore. which is so awesome. i used to come home from school and cheerleading practice crying because of some of the things the girls would say to me. they were so hateful and mean. i loved to cheerlead, but half way through my senior year ii quit cheerleadeing because the girls got so bad. it was really messed up. i always argued with our sponsor because she didn't like me and i had no respect for her because she cheated on her husband and slept with the football coach and she was just horrible. and then she tried to date my boyfriend. this was our sponsor, what kind of authority position was she to be in? anyways, this is just what all is on my mind . i will make my parents happy and come home with awesome grades this semester abd they will be so proud of me! that is my main goal in life right now!

"i really hope my parents let me get a motorcycle. it would be so much easier getting around campus if i had one, versus driving a car and having to park two miles away and walk the rest of the way in one hundred degree heat. i would be the perfect candidate for a motorcycle, i never speed, i don't have a single traffic violation and i have been driving for two years, i am a very defensive driver, and it is the perfect thing to get arounf in at u. t. if i do get a motorcycle i am going to get a kawasaki ninja zx-6r, it is a perfect bike for me because it is not to big, but it is still just as fast as the larger displacement bikes. practicality is a big plus, but it would also be nice to have a nice bike to drive around campus. i think i deserve the motorcycle because the rest of my friends all have very nice things and i am the highest achieving out of all of them, all my friends have brand new cars and trucks, but i got a super used old piece of junk. i know i am going to buy all the things i never had when i make a lt of money, which hopefully will be within a couple of years. a lot of people tell me that u. t. engineers, especially electrical engineers, which is what i am,can make very good money while they are still in college with internships and summer jobs. or my parents would give me the money they had saved up for college if i could get a company to pay for the remainder of my college, by signing an agreement to work for them for a given amount of time. my electrical engineering mentor whom also is an honors student said he made six thousand dollars a month for the summer after his sophomore year. if i could make that much and i was still having fun, like i am now, i would stay and get my masters in either engineering or business, because if i could make fifty to seventy thousand a year my first year out of college, who knows how much i could make with an advanced degree. i would spend so much money on my parents to try to show how thankful i am for putting me in the position i am. i would also spoil myself as well, i would have the finest clothes, the fastest cars, and the most material things. i also enjoy the fact that after four years of electrical engineering i should be a pretty intelligent person, whom hopefully capable of law shcool, grad school, or beyond.

"right now, i am thinking about my chemistry homework and test. i am very nervous about it and i am worried that i may not succeed to my fullest potential. i am also very nervous and anxious about doing this writing assignment because i have never done this before. i'm also listening to music because it helps me to relax. i am cold and sometimes in makes it difficult to concentrate because my attention is focused on my coldness. i pretty much just look around the room every single day and it helps me to think things through. i also think about the things i have done wrong in my life and how it is that i can go back and correct them. there is this person i love so much with my entire heart, but i don't like him hanging around my best friend. wait, its more like i don't like for her to hang around him. yesterday, she just freaked me out because she just came up to us, my friends and i, and she just leaned on my boyfriend. what kind of a friend is she to do that? she knows that i hate for her to be around my boyfriend. and every time she is around him i end up getting mad at him, when, in reality, i should be getting mad at her. there are so many things i want to tell her, but i'm afraid i'll end up hurting her, but i feel she needs to know that it does hurt me a lot when i see her flirting with my boyfriend. she has always been boy crazy, its just that people don't know that. every time she is around him i get this ugly feeling in my tummy like there is something very wrong. and then today just out of nowhere i told her that she needed to find herself a man, a companion that she could spend time with and stay away from me and my boyfriend. i know i shouldn't say that, but its true. i have always been very insecure about myself, but my boyfriend always tells me that i am beautiful and that he loves me very much. i truly believe him and in my heart that we love each other. its just my best friend somehow interferes. i figure is she keeps on doing that i am going to let her know how i feel because i don't want to keep my feeling all bottled up inside of me. first of all, i have never been able to deal with my feelings so i pretty much just kept them bottled up inside. i don't know why i did that but i did, up until the time i started going out with my boyfriend. he changed me and the way i felt about myself and i cherish that because he has made a huge impact in my life. i love him so dearly. anyways, enough about that. i talked to my dad about an hour ago. i call him every day, twice a day in fact. i am what you call daddy's little girl!"" i am very proud to say that because i love my father very much. he has done so much for me and i wish there was a way that i could give something back. the thing is i used to be able to tell my dad everything, but then something changed. i stopped telling certain things. i guess he kind of saw me as something i wasn't and that made me very sad. in fact, i'm getting teary-eyed right now. it's like my father had this whole other image of the daughter he wanted. i tried to tell him that i was different, but he just wouldn't understand. and now that i am over here at college its like, i wish i could take back every bad thing i did to him. i want to tell him everything that has happened in my life, some good things and some bad. i want him to know all the obstacles and temptations that i have encountered throughout the past few years. i feel he needs to know what his daughter has gone through in her life. a few days ago when i talked to him, i felt homesick. when i hung up with him, i started crying. i poured my heart out right in front of my boyfriend. i told my boyfriend everything about how i wanted to have a better relationship with my father. i want to let him know that i love him so much and that i appreciate him for everything he has done for me. i also miss my mom because she has always done things for me and taught me different things. she is special to me because of who she is. i love her dearly. i miss my little brother and older brother too. i also miss my dog and my cat. they are like my children. they are growing up without their mommy and that makes me sad. i want to be there for them. i love my dad, mom, brothers and boyfriend. i hope they know that they mean a lot to me and that i am lucky to have them as a part of my life.

"well its after classes on this friday. i am sll freaking' stressed out. stupid fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. it's not that i don't know how to do it, it's just that i doubted myself. i don't know, ever since i have been here i think that i have gotten dumber, when in reality i am not. i am actually pretty damn smart. i am just letting what everyone says get to my head. so it pretty much is my fault anyway. well from now on, i am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like i am smarter than the professor that made them. i probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. damn i miss my girlfriend. she is like so freaking hot. yeah i know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and i wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. she is more mature than most of the girls i have for classes and some of my close girl friends. damn i am sneezing well i am doing this in a friends room so yeah. well jessica is hot and i miss her. its not really a distraction. today i was tired i have no idea why i have been sleeping more than i ever have. i don't even read for classes. college isn't even hard. i could not read and make a c in all my classes but i want a's damnit. stupid medical school. wish i could fast forward my life about 8 years. but i'll be a pinche viejo by then. i wonder if because i am cussing the person that reads this will think i am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality i probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. and its not like i am a big cusser. its just i have been so damn stressed lately. i was doing my chemistry homework and i ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. not like one or two try like 10 to 20 strands of hair. um. went blank. nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than i can type them out. this keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. well, here i am in college. everyone once in a while it sets in. they are a lot of hot girls here. i really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because i am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. i have been in love before. went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. four damn years. my feet stink and its driving me nuts. its like i can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. i wonder if other people have that problem. i am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. its probably all the bacteria on my feet. o well. tonight i think i am going to get drunk. i have never drank before, well i have taken some sips like four. beer tastes like shit. i am just going to drink ""chick"" drinks. i don't care what guys say. and if i do something stupid tonight o well, i need to wind down. i have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. o well. sucks to be in college. you know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. in fact i would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. i know i could do that but i don't know i guess i don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. i don't think i like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. i don't like to leave things to chance. but then life has screwed me over so many times before even when i was doing all the right things so what was the point. i mean i didn't drink or do drugs i mean i tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. i love god i would go to church and like it, i would have my quiet time, i would be a pretty good christian example till like my jr. year and what happened? my parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did. gosh damn i am still embarrassed of what he did. so yeah all things this i was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes i would have had it. he mad 80,000 a year and my mom made 40,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley. its next to mexico, and no we weren't drug dealers. hah. that's funny if i hadn't put that in, you might have thought that. nah he ",1,-0.591971 0.30972 -0.605847 0.515879 0.480826 -0.65689 -0.740834 -0.974071 -1.395869 0.909068 -0.186074 -0.393922 -0.682432 -0.219797 -0.607445 0.0 -0.04277 0.600074 0.623715 -0.61878 0.491435 0.116192 0.077669 0.22929 0.968512 -0.982894 -1.255652 0.603235 0.551408 -0.739408 0.201896 -0.922186 1.628422 0.018182 2.75225 -0.274637 -0.513229 -0.66769 -0.745767 -0.293426 -1.038726 0.09504 -0.252287 -0.890131 -0.477492 -0.95348 -0.867344 -0.362034 -1.339901 -0.156608 0.704047 -0.721819 0.316487 -0.031439 -0.757663 -0.645941 -0.925573 -0.483438 0.004172 0.648351 0.962742 -0.929947 0.519292 1.073767 3.373113 0.682593 -0.086094 0.339936 -0.082188 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.403447 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.094263 0.369185 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.063864 5.243988 4.125982 4.111983 4.543709 4.93122,2426
"as i sit here and complete this assignment, i am reminded of all the other homework assignments i have been bombarded with this labor day weekend. much of it is reading, and i know how important it is to keep up with it. i have learned many lessons from procrastinating. i keep thinking how this weekend is flying by too quickly. i am currently enjoying my short stay here back at home. i feel as if that in the blink of an eye, i will be back at college. when i returned home on friday, i went to my brother's high school football game. just being in that atmosphere brought back all the feelings of high school. some were good and some bad, but i will always treasure the memories of going to those games and having the time of my life with my friends. my birthday is next monday on the thirteenth, and it will definitely not be the same without all of my close high school friends. i cannot believe my birthday this year has to be on the worst day of the week. i will probably celebrate it with my family next weekend. my feet are freezing right now. i need to put some warm slippers on. since i am writing this assignment on paper first, my hand is beginning to cramp up. however, i am beginning to think of how much i am truly enjoying this assignment. i like the way i can just freely express myself without any impediments to cease me. i feel a bit hungry because i have not eaten breakfast yet, and it is nearly lunch time. i have a familiar craving for fruit. my mom has read my mind and has just brought a bowl of grapes over to me. the taste of cold, plump, luscious grapes satisfies my momentary craving. i need to go running today because i did not eat very healthy yesterday, and i feel fat. i wonder if it has been twenty minutes yet. i think so. i better stop before i babble on forever and ever about the most randomest things.

"i'm kind of frustrated right now with callie. she just left to go to meeting and she just bothers me. it's like she's annoyed with me but she won't say anything. i hate it when people do that-it's like just tell me what's going on, don't just act nonchalant about it. it pisses me off. it's like she just kind of ignores me all the time. i thought it would be better when she came back this weekend, since we spent time apart, but it's not. gosh i sound like i'm talking about my boyfriend or something. but nope, it's my roommate. i'm feeling kind of pissed off about a lot of things actually. i ate way too much yesterday which sucked. and i was doing really well about working out here, and now all of a sudden i'm getting lazy. i don't get it at all. i talked to price last night which made me feel happy and sad at the same time. it usually does when i'm here at school. he always makes me homesick. it just sucks because i was home the entire summer and he just didn't take advantage of it. i tried, i really did, but he didn't really make the effort until like the day before i left. figures. it's so hard because we both like each other, but there's nothing we can do about it. it is so stupid that we are not in the same grade. i just keep thinking that god does everything for a reason, and that i should just feel lucky he found a way to bring us together in the first place. i went to church for the second time since being at ut. it felt good, but sad too. kind of like talking to price. i don't know-i know everyone says over and over again that it's hard to find a church in college and that you just have to keep an open mind, etc, etc. but it's true and i keep comparing everything to mdumc. i miss it so much, especially steve and kristi. i miss everyone there. i wonder what it would be like to go home again next summer and do staff. i would probably be really bored, but i guess god will lead me where i'm meant to be. i just don't want to spend all summer in austin drinking my life away. i mean, don't get me wrong, i like drinking, but i just don't enjoy doing it all the time. i just really need to get involved with some christian organizations here. i also need to find a bible study that i enjoy. i feel so lost if i don't have fellowship to keep me on track in my faith walk. i hate being so close to god in the summer and then straying so during the school year. that's just not how it should be. i have got to work on it. i especially need to do my part here, like praying and quiet times. it's like working out-no never mind, that's an awful comparison that i really don't want to make. i wonder and daydream way too much. i wonder about stupid girly stuff sometimes like who i'm going to marry and when. i wonder if i'm going to get a job. i wonder about why i'm such a moody person. sometimes i feel really different from everyone else around me. sometimes i wonder what i would be like if i went to a&m. would cal and i still be inseperable? would rt and i be good friends? i don't know, it's just weird. i wonder how it's going to be with price when he goes to college. i wonder if he'll meet some girl and totally forget about me. i'd probably be so jealous if he ever found someone that he was closer to than me. but i shouldn't if he does-i should simply be incredibly happy for him. we just have a weird relationship. i wonder how mike's doing really. i mean, i know he acts the same, but he has to be going through a lot. i can't even imagine. sometimes i want to ask him about it, but i don't know how to put it or what to say. i mean, i can't just randomly bring it up. i wish sometimes that we still talked like we did in high school. it was weird last night when callie and todd were talking about travis on the phone. i haven't thought about that boy in a long, long time. he still makes me mad. what a stupid thing he did. i still can't believe he threw away our friendship. we really clicked. we could talk about anything, and that just doesn't happen very often with two people. i mean, i obviously got over him romantically, but we could have been lifelong friends. too bad for him i guess. i still wish sometime down the road that he would apologize, but i think a lot of people in life wait for apologies that they will never receive, or for people to come back into their lives that never will. it's foolish i know. i love my parents so much. i wish that i could treat them the way i want to deep inside. the way i know i will wish i did all of my life when they are gone. it's just ridiculous how much they do for me.

"it said tall macintosh so i wasn't sure what that meant. anyways, right now i am kind of upset because my roomates are messy and keep on leaving the lights on when they are not occupying the room. i hope our electric bill isn't very high. man, i have so much reading to do it is not even funny. i miss my boyfriend and family a lot and want to go home. sometimes i wish i could just go to college at home. i can't go there cause i have a scholarship to attend this school. i have been very bored lately. wow, i am so suprised that there wasn't a humungous waiting list to use these computers. i sure hope this computer isn't for a handicap person cause it is higher than all the others. oh, well if a handicap person comes i'll just move. the guy across from me looks funny because he is looking at his computer with astonishment and his mouth is wide open. i'm trying to think of things to write but it is kind of boring in here so my thoughts are not flooding out like they usually do. i tried to do the pre-testing but it wouldn't let me in because it said other people were already using it. that sucks!!!!! man, after this i think i am going to move to another regular computer because i am starting to feel really guilty. there are a lot of empty computers right now. cool there is a huge m hanging above my computer and my name starts with m. after this i will probably search the web for volunteer agencies that i can volunteer for for my social work class. i have about 8 more minutes to write. man, something got on my beautiful, cute kitty folder and made some of the paint come off. i wonder what it was. these computers are cool because you can bring cd's and listen to them. is that a girl or a boy? first i thought it was a boy but he'she had a very colorful girlish looking purse. i think it is a boy. my hands are starting to kind of hurt from typing. i probably sound like a baby. oh man, a guy just sat at the computer that i was planning to use next. i guess i'll just sit on the next role. 5 more minutes. i hope it is not dark when i go home cause i have to walk. i'm bored!!!!!!!i can't wait to go home and eat. what shall i eat??? i certainly don't feel like eating hamburger helper leftovers again. maybe i'll order something from plucker's or walk over there. 3 more minutes. they should have music in here. nah, that's not a good idea cause not everybody likes the same kind of music or can concentrate with it on. i can. i think i've seen that guy before somewhere. well, time is about up, finally :) ",0,-0.12697 0.626072 0.327119 0.389455 0.016362 -0.150352 -0.042304 -0.411524 0.244704 -0.590446 -0.189318 0.092707 0.644109 0.438032 0.378021 0.0 -0.04277 -0.515351 -0.341468 -0.483137 -0.490381 -0.438877 -0.296734 0.154906 -0.624052 0.327827 -0.340432 -0.369996 0.44818 0.559728 -0.639944 0.367324 0.060781 -0.361532 -0.647758 0.365938 -0.600203 1.012622 -0.756049 -0.720561 0.450087 0.501973 0.177681 0.817564 0.673817 -0.154216 0.105599 -0.139163 -0.973348 -0.624712 3.596313 -0.461057 -0.101464 1.079881 -1.14502 1.437684 1.405938 -0.122116 -1.180556 0.104112 1.195256 -0.020778 -0.480161 -0.209381 -0.013889 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.192528 -0.325742 0.117183 -0.23436 0.837069 2.571011 -0.056301 -0.422267 0.306314 -0.451544 0.296132 0.604685 4.764076 4.173549 4.768246 4.539848 4.324402,457
" ok, here i go. i wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this. probably all kinds of things. well, i have a girlfriend, her name is lauren, and today is our 10 month aniversary. i'm excited but i'm sad that i don't get to see her that much because she is still in high school. she goes to clark in san antonio just like i did. that's where we met. we were both on the cross country team. i'm kind of tired. i wish i didn't have to spend all my time reading the iliad. it's getting really boring and i don't even think it's a very good book. they just like it because it's old. like last night i spent several hours reading it and i still had to do more before i went to class today. man, it's only been 5 minutes, i don't think i can actually think for a whole 20. i wonder what i would be doing if i wasn't doing this right now. probably doing calculus homework or reading, heaven-for-bid, the iliad. i can't wait until the weekend when i can relax some more. at least i only have one class tomorrow and it's really easy. it's calculus and this is my third year in a row of taking it for i shouldn't have any trouble with it. unfortunately though it's all stuff i've already learned so it's boring also. let's see, that makes two boring classes now. how about ancient rome and ba101, those are also boring classes, but at least i like rome so at times that class can be interesting. so that leaves psychology, that's definitely the best class i'm taking, because it's really interesting. especially because many of the things don't have answers so it's just what you think. i'm probably biased towards it though, because i've always been a math and science fan. math was ruined by one teacher i had, but i still love science. hopefully, i can use the business skills i learn to start or work for something like a bioengineering company, that would be cool. psychology is also fun because i know a few people in there. one of the guys in there i went to pre-school and kindergarten with and haven't really seen him since. monday i met this girl named jessica. she's pretty nice so i have someone to talk to before class. bjorn just got home, i wonder where he's been. he probably was at class, i wonder which one. he really likes cake and he just turned them on. i can tell when he's in his room usually because there is music on. he also likes the beatles. i don't really like the beatles but cake is cool. i wonder who just got on aim. i guess it was rory because he just imed me. i wonder what he wants. maybe i'll have to tell him to go away, but i probably won't, because i'm not that kind of person. i don't like putting people down or causing conflict. i guess that's just who i am. i am, i think that's the best quote i've ever heard. it can be interpreted in so many ways and it's the only think that we know is absolutely true.

"right now, i am in a really good mood, i don't really know why because this morning i was so dead, and i thought i would feel like that all day, but i woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but i was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. i don't know how people do it every night! i am so worn out every day! i just need to take a few days off to sleep. i am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits! i have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and i really need to go running, so i hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder i think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. i really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else i would have never woken up. and i really miss my dog. i think i have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god i'm taking psychology. haha i literally miss her more than my parents! i hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. i always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. i would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding! it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! i was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder i was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like i wanted to! she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and i think that's awesome. sometimes i wish i could be more like that. i am a fairly independent person, but i know i follow the trend a lot too. i hope i do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! i miss dance so much! i can't believe i quit - i am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when i quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully i can start back up. i seriously think i've gained the freshman 100! for some reason when i get stressed out i start to eat. a lot. i need to get control! i think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. i love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. i think i'm kind of in between. i love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!? he used to be so funny and nice. i wonder what my sister is doing right now. i miss her about the same as i miss my pooch. she is so sweet. i hope she is okay. i worry about her all the time, i just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. i am the complete opposite! i spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. i know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :( i really need to stretch. i think running will be good for me today. i need to burn off some steam for sure. i wonder how molly is doing. i haven't talked to her in awhile. i feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and i was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when i call, so i hope she is at least having fun. i bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't i find a guy? they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which i am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't i get my first choice! i really want to know what i did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and i am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did i spill my guts that night about it to nathan. i am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run!

"it was a really humid day today while i was walking around on campus, but now since i'm at home looking out my window, i see so many people coming home from campus, getting off the bus with water bottles. i realized that texas weather is crazy. at one point it's humid and then the next it is super hot. it's nice and clear now. i'm sure its not that hot because it's going to be 6 pretty soon and it cools down around this time. earlier today i thought it was going to rain. i really don't like walking around in the rain. my first day of class at ut it rained and i didn't know where i was going i was really miserable. before you get home you get soaking wet and then the ac units are on all around campus so your freeze through your classes. sometimes i wonder how the students at ut feel away from home. i know that my first semester here i was extremely homesick. i hated living away from home even though i was only 30 minutes away. i lived in an apt my first year and i regret the fact that i didn't live in a dorm because i would have gotten to meet so many more people that way. but then again i liked living in an apartment because i had my own space. i didn't have to share a bathroom with anyone and it sure wasn't a crowded community with only two people in 1200 square feet area. my freshman year i didn't meet very many people, but my second year i was introduced to so many more people and i started enjoying college rather than just staying at home and reading or doing homework and watching tv. there's been a big change from then and now. i actually like to stay in austin instead of going home on the weekends because i always have something to do. at home i get bored very easily. of course i still miss my parents but its so different here with all my friends. all kinds of crazy actions go on. college life it super busy. this semester i feel is going to fly by. before i know it i will be on thanksgiving break then studying for finals and then home again in two weeks after that. sometimes i feel like i need to be more active in school programs and associations. i never have time though. something is always coming up. i have a load of homework or a test coming up that stops me from attending these functions, or most of the time i am just way too tired to do anything. for example, right now i wish i was lying in my bed taking a nap because i'll probably have to hit the books as soon as i'm done with this writing assignment. i never knew twenty minutes would take this long. twenty minutes is a very long time. as you can probably tell i am getting very restless. i have very short patience. i like to take care of my business and get going on to the next. time can be very crucial sometimes. when i'm late to class i wish i had more time to take are of all my stuff before i have to head out but other time when i have too much time on my hands i wish i had some chores to do or homework, despise the fact that homework can be a killer sometimes. i don't like the way this apartment is never the right temperature. it is always too cold or always too hot. it is never the right temperature. i think its because all of the rooms in this apartment are at different angles so they get cold and hot and different rates so my roommates and i always change the temperature on the thermostat according to how we each want it. oh well i guess that's the way it works. i just looked at the timer and i have a minute or so left so now i'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts. it's nice to randomly talk about different stuff. it's unusual but good writing assignment. kinda funny that i sat here and typed away for a good twenty minutes, and i just got stopped so i guess that's it.

"ok. i've finally made it here! you know, i had always thought that once i got to college, the stressful life i once knew back in my home town of conroe would no longer exist. well, i was so terribly wrong! however, though i am completely busy every second of every day, it's been a blast! yesterday for example: i woke up bright and early at 6:30, had class from 910 and 1011, came back to my beautifully decorated dorm in jester west and tried for like an hour to get to this page which i later found out was down at the time, then, briskly ran to my philosophy class which lasted from 12, after which i tanned, went back home again to brush my teeth and wash my face before my psy. class (yours!) from 3305. once class was over, my friend johnna and i proceeded to take the long hike back to jester in the rain! (yay!) there, i ate my first meal of the day pot roast! mmmmm. next, i had to walk all the way over to my parking spot on trinity where because i needed to get some clothes my dad brought down for my some time last week that have just been sitting in the trunk of my car getting all wrinkled and nasty. rather than walk back with two armfulls of clothes, i decided to drive back. after the laundry was hanging safely in my tiny closet, i took it upon myself to fight the 630 austin traffic over to my grandparents house off of lamar where i was instructed all week by my mother to take my car so it could get a new inspection sticker. while in traffic, i happened to notice that my sticker would not be out of date until november! this was particularly angering to me because tonight from 912 or so, i was to attend a mixer with my pledge sisters and the pledge members of sigma ki and instead of having just a few moments to myself before i had to take another shower and proceed to get ready, i was cooling my heels in a traffic jam for a car inspection sticker that wasn't necessary at the time. however, once at the grandparents house, i did stock up on some much needed food and beverage products. now, i am finally back and i have all of 10 minutes to sit on my floor, watch a little tv and eat some reesesmini cup. after that, i quickly got ready for the nights planned activity. the party actually turned out to be pretty fun except for the fact the austin police made two appearances! luckily, neither me or any of my sisters had formal charges brought against them. ok enough of that. only about 6 minutes left and i still have so much to say! let's talk about the future i want to live in a loft apartment in new york city with huge, towering white walls, bay windows, and blackandwhite checkered tile in the kitchen. i hopefully will be an established poet. also, i would like to have a successful career as a professional buyer. now, this job would be just too great for me all day long, i would be able to shop! my clientele would range from movie stars to the rich who haven't the time, or fashion sense, to dress and style themselves. ah! my time here is up! thank you and i hope you have enjoyed the show:)and remember kids: carpe' diem!

"i don't know if i should go home or not this weekend. i want to stay, but. i hope my computer doesn't freeze while i'm writing this, that would totally suck i'm glad i'm getting this out of the way, normally i would wait till the last possible second, but i don't trust computers since i've been here. i really want to like it here but i just don't. all my friends that went to oter schools are having a great time, they're meeting new people doing new things, but evryone i meet bores me, it seems as though everyone is the same. i don't even feel like going out and having fun. the only reason i want to is so mabe i'd come to like ut better. i see so many people i know, its kinda weird, when theres about fifty thousand people here. i'm a business major but the only class that is relavant to busins is my freshman ba class which meets only once a week. i'm afraid i'm not goingto find the parties here that much fun. from what i've heard its just people getting drunk and thats not that much fun. i worry that all the expectations i've had about college are misconceptions. i love this keyboard. i like typing, but i can't use regular desktops, because i can't sit still. i sund like a dumbass when i repeat myself. alex told me the funniest joke but i can't remember it although when he told me i tried to memorize it. i hate it here when i think about hte people at home. i have no one here. i'm so bored. my classes are boring for the mostpart, and i'm finally getting the hang of schedules and shit. i want to call my cousin, who is my role model and ask if she liked her first month in colllege. she always putwss me in a good mood. justin says there ids nothing wrong with my comp but why the hell does it keep freezing? i think twenty minutes are almost up nope i still have bout ten to go. my tth classes are so long. i start gettig restless- that music next door is so loud and i am so tired i want to take a nap. i had to wake upa a t ",1,-0.440532 0.443206 0.906291 0.528975 1.048837 -0.810524 -0.931799 -1.04081 -1.200141 -0.991831 -0.143968 -0.059105 1.387137 -0.518907 -0.415631 0.0 -0.04277 0.648843 1.471377 -0.795527 1.338188 -0.742368 -0.648496 0.670752 -0.624052 -0.007992 -2.446905 0.584993 1.623407 0.677811 0.637633 0.832229 1.383383 1.149776 0.845689 -1.109326 0.195622 -0.309713 -0.793213 1.626448 -0.101863 -1.140579 -0.452116 -0.28409 -0.900106 1.078445 -0.590456 -0.345907 1.369777 -1.097158 0.726786 -0.095849 -0.42646 0.104471 -1.700474 -0.501015 -1.679604 -0.954251 -0.621427 0.602775 -0.146412 -0.109376 0.260897 -0.070852 2.136087 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.251288 0.180546 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.153211 -0.37208 0.016292 -0.422267 1.40521 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.221121 5.014982 3.92694 4.170066 4.713987 4.786212,816
"losing my best friend the day before classes started doesn't necessarily ""enhance"" my college experience. so much has been circulating through my head. why did this happen? she and her sister had so much to live for, and now they are both dead because of a freak accident. a careless mistake took the only two children their parents will know to be their own. in a perverted way i find the situation ironic. alice had done so many stupid things in her life and come away from them without a scratch, but her sister took a turn too fast and it took both of their lives. i find myself unable to think too much about it recently. i am able to say ""my best friend just died"" but i haven't found it possible to truly feel the extent of pain that i do. i find myself going through the day forcing a smile here and there, a laugh if i hear something funny, but i have never had such a consistent view of the sidewalk. i am polite to the girls in my dorm, but i am somehow furious that they don't understand my pain. i wouldn't either if someone had come to me with this situation three weeks ago. no one does until it affects you personally. it's like one of those after-school specials on teen-aged depression. i find myself shutting down sometimes and hating the world. if i believed in a god, it would only be one more person to hate and blame for this. i know i need to make new friends but can only wish to see and talk to my old friends, friends that understand. i know i need to get out and do things, but the thought of socializing with strangers frustrates the hell out of me. i find myself going through phases of denial, then rage, then depression, and then denial again. sometimes i want to put my fist through the wall, other times i want to curl up in a little ball and just stay there for weeks. sometimes nothing seems important. what good does it do to strive for perfection if it can all be taken away that quickly? what good does it do to have people close to your heart, if it only hurts that much more when you lose them? of course i know the answers to these questions, but recently i've challenged everything i have trusted to be true.

"when i first thought about the stream of consciousness writing assignment, i figured my natural stream of consciousness would deliver my views on life and the issues that apply to the everyday. however, all i've been able to think about in the past twenty minutes is a girl. her name is kaylee. we became close towards the end of the summer before i came back to austin. she lives in dallas so its hard to get to see her very often. one date was all it took. i mean i've known the girl for years, but it became different after this one night. kind of going from childhood friends to, i don't know, maybe something romantic. if i had known anything was there, i would've stomped on this opportunity a long time ago kind of like if i had known that there were 5 very essential vitamins in california style sunny delight, i would've drunk that my whole life instead of orange juice. when did they come out with sunny delight anyways? i don't think it's been around for my entire life but probably pretty close. possibly when i was five or six years old. at any rate, i always think to myself could this girl be the one? she's beautiful to start with, and besides that, she's just amazing. i can't spend enough time with that girl. just going to the playground and swinging with her makes me happy. i got a call from her the other day saying she was going to come see me next weekend. this could possibly be why i haven't been able to get her out of my mind. i really can't wait to see her. possibly more excited than going to chile next summer. i'm just packing up my bags and heading down there to see if i can land a job at a local ski resort. i've always wanted to ski bum for a season, so i figured this would be a good chance. and being that the summer in our hemisphere is winter in their hemisphere, it works out having all summer off. i was actually stressing about this all day being that it has to be in by 5 o clock. i'm leaving for college station sometime today and i have got so much to do. a police officer gave me a speeding ticket two nights ago on riverside. now i have to take defensive driving and get my car inspected to get out of this ticket. and this, piled onto everything else that is going on. i'd say my stress level has recently risen to a 7! nonetheless, i'm getting out of town this weekend and probably the next too. the swells are getting up to 6 feet on the texas gulf coast this weekend which is unheard of around here, so i want to get out and catch some waves before they recede. surfing just makes me relax puts me in a zone where there are no worries. soccer doesn't do that for me. i played all my life and it was very fun but also came with a lot of pressure. there were many reasons i guess, but i just played to play, not to win a state championship or anything. well i guess my twenty minutes are up, time to take a shower!

"does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? this whole electronic assignment is very new to me and i have no clue what i should do! i'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. as i'm typing, my fingers are shaking. the whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! college is a completely different world and i honestly don't know how well i will do! do i have to capitalize my i's ? i type much faster if i don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. this 20 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 7 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in ap language. mendrop made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely wrong! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think, what am i supposed to do now? i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ?

" i wish travis would stop switching channels on the tv. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at ut. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. so in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. for a 19 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature? i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like kendra im gay and i'll be like i know its about time and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of pbs. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his alone time with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video ",0,-0.600765 -0.226722 0.288198 0.0038 -0.012233 1.619162 -0.737244 -0.750137 -0.389211 0.189604 -0.155623 -0.303522 -0.299211 0.027207 -0.453259 0.0 -0.04277 0.819875 -1.285228 -0.795527 -1.570244 -0.525469 4.198267 -0.889702 0.381778 -0.386211 0.558637 -0.662075 -1.568163 -0.909687 -0.442314 -0.788316 -1.275466 -0.906028 -0.753383 -0.40643 -0.310686 -0.796767 -0.140781 0.298415 0.025301 0.385608 0.911598 0.34048 1.877563 -0.30229 -0.522178 1.9661 -0.610887 2.806531 0.30169 0.524043 0.188231 -1.071247 0.681365 0.586608 1.66016 -0.359539 0.251015 -0.433484 0.708121 -1.035766 -0.480161 -0.362261 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.058372 -1.297083 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.349664 -0.37208 0.064257 -0.422267 0.490649 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.652694 5.174144 3.198047 5.023906 4.914641 4.824162,1665
"as i sit in this room, in this computer lab, i hear all the different sounds around me. the computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. i also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as i type. i've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. my eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, i would love to take a nap. this day was pretty long. i hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. i'm feeling so tired! i would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. i don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. i know when i go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but i ate way too much today and i am not in the least bit hungry. not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. i wish i was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. i hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. it would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. seeing him makes me miss him more but i guess i should enjoy our time together. i wish he went to this school or at least lived in austin then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. he seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. i don't believe him when he says that. i wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. i am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. i hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? i wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. i think i'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because i'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. i do love him though. it'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. tonight is thursday night. this is a good night because i have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. i should have done this assignment earlier but of course i always wait for the last minute. but technically this isn't the last minute because its not friday yet, and it is early evening. tonight i want to do nothing but relax! i hope i can get together with my friends since i don't see much of them anymore. i wish i lived at jester at times like this. i thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. i have this sweatshirt on but i don't feel like taking it off. how many more minutes until my time is up? i've typed quite a bit of information thus far. pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. i wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that i type fast and i can type basically every thing that i am thinking. this computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. i hear music and i'm wondering where it is coming from. i figure since tonight is the mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. they should have a honduran culture night. haha. why is the computer across from me making so much noise? wow. i sure do ask my self a lot of questions. well, i think my time is almost up. i guess i have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. i am so terrible at mental math. what happened? i have 5 minutes left i guess. how terrible i am at mental math! i am glad that i don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. my grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and i've been too lazy to go to the office hours. but i did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. i walked all that way to jester for nothing. i'm sure if i got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. why am i assuming that i will get a bad grade? maybe i won't. the ta seems pretty easy going and she knows that i am interested in keeping'getting a good grade for that class. i. am glad the movie station is back on. i'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. sleep. i want to sleep! i wish i wasn't always so tired. yes! i only have a few more minutes left. i'd say about 2 minutes left. finally! this is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in times new roman font. i didn't know i had that much stuff running through my head. actually, it doesn't surprise me. i always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and i can't think straight. i think that's why i interrupt people so much when i'm talking. because i have so much stuff in my mind that if i don't say it i'll forget it. i guess that shouldn't matter since i'll have another 10 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. but anyways. my time is up. how great!

"my thoughts are all jumbled right now. my life is so different now than it was 2 months ago. i had no idea that leaving home and beginning a life on my own would change me so much. for years now, i've anticipated this change in my life. i've so wanted to be on my own. not because there's anything wrong with my life at home, but because i've always been an independent person. i've always felt i needed to do things for myself. take care of myself. not be such a burden. today. tons of things have gone through my mind. most of the day. it has been sleep. i love saturdays. i love to sleep and not have to worry about getting up to do anything. but. at times. i think about home. the things i'm missing. and the things they're missing about me. i think about my little brother. and how i'm missing him grow up. i know i've only been gone for three weeks, but he has changed in my eyes so much in those three weeks. i think about the birthdays i'm missing because i just can't make it home every weekend. and i think about my friends. my best friend, amber. how i miss talking to her about everything. how i wish she were here to experience all the stuff that i'm experiencing right now. i think a lot about my ""boyfriend"". i put it in quotes because we're not exclusive anymore. we're ""dating other people"". i think about how much i miss him. his eyes. his laugh. his attention. but today when i woke up, the first thoughts that came to my head was. nikki, you have two papers to write for psychology. better get it done. nikki, you have to mail you're grandmother a birthday card. you're going to miss her birthday this year. nikki, you have to mail your paycheck home so mom can deposit it for you. nikki, you have no money left from that paycheck. so stop spending. life is so different for me now. i've got so much to think about everyday. like i haven't done laundry in a week and a half. and i'm running out of clothes. i have to get that done too. at times, i miss having my mom there to remind me of everything. to tell me to do stuff. but at times, i don't miss that. i'm glad i'm getting things done without having to be told. i think about other stuff too. like. where am i going to live next year?. am i going to be friends with the same people? i've been so lucky up to this point. i've got the greatest friends. they'd do anything for me and each other. i love them. and i've only known them for three weeks. i've got to think about work too. how different it is from work at home. how there are just those days when i just don't want to go. and how i'm so glad that i get a break today and don't have to go in. don't get me wrong. i love my job. it's just. i feel overwhelmed at times. my friends are going this way. and that way. and none of them have jobs. when i'm working almost every weeknight. sometimes i feel deprived. of there time. of my own time. but then i remember that i am now a responsible adult. and i am doing things for myself. i have to find a church down here in austin, too. i've never had the experience of doing that before. i've always been a member of the same church. always been around the same people. coming from a small town, that happens. but god is a big part of my life. and i've got to find a church. i worry about that a lot. it's something new for me. and i'm scared. right now. i'm thinking about how cold it is in this stupid room. and how it didn't do me any good to shave my legs. oh, and how cold it's going to be this winter. so glad i bought a down comforter. well. that's about all i'm thinking about lately. so i guess this brings my paper to an end. thanks for listening.

" i'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. i keep asking myself whether or not i'm am going to make it in my major. my major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. my friends say they don't know what i got myself into, but i keep telling them i'll be fine to not worry about me. when i say this i am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that i will be fine. this library is all to silent i think i just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. while i'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not i am going to make an a on the chemistry exam on tuesday. i feel bombarded with chem and i don't know if i am going to be able to remember all three chapters. my mind keeps telling me that i will be fine that i just have to get used to it. high school was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. that hasnt been my problem lately the only problems i have had all are about having not enough time. every time i talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, i tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. i know older people had told me the same but i really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. oh yeah i am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. i feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. i feel like they all grasp the ideas that i don't. in high school i was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. maybe that's just me overthinking. i can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. it smells like a piece of chocolate. maybe it is a candybar of some sort. i don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. i am not a real big fan chocolate but i do love chocolate ice cream. something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. lately i have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. i miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. she is graduating a semester early from hs and is going to move to austin and attend acc for the remainder of the year. i offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. i hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. the man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing. he now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. all she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. she is one of the most ungrateful people i have ever encountered in my whole entire life. people who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but i see the real her everyday.

"well, i don't lnow what all to type about, since we can type about anything. my boyfriend that i haven't seen since i moved down here three weeks ago came down today from dallas, so i'm pretty excited about that. i wish he didn't have to leave on monday, but he has schoo, aslo. my roommate is on the computer next to me, reading about el nino, and her boyfriend is watching me type. this computer lab stinks. my boyfriend is bored out of his mind, because he wants to plays games but can't get on a computer. i think this psychology course is going to be hard, because there are so many people in the class. five hundred peoplr is a bit too many people to have in one class--how will anyone learn anything? also, the whole experiment thing is very strange. what are they going to study about us? i sure as heck am not going to write a research paper, though. i hate writing papers! i'm glad that we don't have a final in our class. but i have a final in my philosophy class, and it's also on the last day. that sucks. i was hoping i could go home and work during the christmas holidays, but since i won't leave until december 16, that's not good. at least we don't have to be back until january 20, though!! that is good enough for me. aaron and i are both growing impatient. i feel like i have been typing for an hour, but it has on;y been ten minutes. i can't wait until tonight. me, aaron, manda, and brannon are going out to eat and to see g. i. jane. i've been wanting to see that movie forever. if brannon doesn't shut up, i'm going to back hand him. aaron is playing with the mouse and it is driving me crazy. now he's laughing up a storm, and it is also driving me crazy. branon is a pervert. o, excuse me, he thinks he's romantic. now we're all laughing and talking about don juan demarco, whoever he is. i am so hungry. i haven't eaten all day, and my stomach feels like it's gonna cave in. now aaron is talking about taco bell, and i'm going to vomit. i hate taco bell, as well as almost all fast food restaurants. now aaron is reading what i am typing, and it is annoying me. not really, almost everything he does i think is cute. i miss him a lot, i'm really glad he's here this weekend. he's fixing to move down here in a month, because he's graduating from the art institute of dallas on september 30, the same day as our first exam. now they are talking talking about how nasty undershirts look. if aaron picks at his foot one more time i'm gonna slap him. now my time is up, i'm really glad.

" well, i am sitting here fighting with myself about whether or not i should go out tongight. it looks like i will probably give in and go to the ka house. i don't think i should because i have a lot of work to do. i am excited to go and see my grandmother tomorrow. i miss my friends a lot especially justin. i am wondering why i haven't been able to get a hold of him. so i don't have a lot on my mind, but this is fun because i get to listen to all of the music i just downloaded. our tv in the living room is super loud! i can hear it over my music and through a closed door. things with bryan seem to be going well, but i definitely don't see things progressing too much further. i am really tired today. i should be sleeping a lot more than i have been. oh well. i need to do my devotional before i go anywhere tonight because i will feel really bad if i forget. i am very concerned about justin. i cannot stop thinking about what our issues are or aren't. i wonder what my parents are doing tonight. i miss seeing them every day, but at least i talk to them a lot. it feels super weird to be away and completely on my own, but i think i will surprise myself at how well i will do. that pizza that i ate earlier was not good. i guess it doesn't settle well because i don't eat it very often. i am so excited about my kin class. it is so awesome, and i love that the professors are married and christians. that's so great. paige is really cool, too, and i am very glad that she is in that class with me. i hope we end up hanging out a lot this year. i was so worried about meeting people who loved god, and it's been really reassuring so far. the tri-delts are perfect girls for me. they're so good, and they have 3 bible studies! yea! elton john is really talented. it cracks me up that i've gotten so into this computer business. it's really fun, though. i got my first email today. who better from but sebastian? he's awesome, but it sucks that he lives in chile. okay, i am having a lull. i really feel very exhausted, but of course i will go out as soon as i finish this assignment. it is so stupid how vain i have gotten since i have been here, but i am sure that that will go away after a little time. i am so nervous about taking my first tests. i love all of my classes, but i wonder about how prepared i am from high school, and how well my study habits will allow me to do. this assignment is really very cool. i thought it would take forever, but the time is flying. so i am very cold right now; surprise, surprise. i think of my girls from kerrville every time that i begin a sentence with so. i definitely should not do that very much. my mother would not be proud of me. unchained melody must be one of the most romantic songs ever recorded. it makes me miss justin. i suppose i will try to call him again right now.

"i am sitting here wondering as to why i chose to do this assignment at this particular time. as i search my the thoughts the number one reason i can find is boredom. i am so bored right now, as i have throughout my entire ut experience. i miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. i have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but i feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that i have become accustomed to over the past 18 years. i'm pretty sure that i just used a runon sentence. five minutes down, fifteen to go. notice that i spelled out the words ""five"" and ""fifteen"" in order to waste. i am wasting this time because i don't feel any need to be introspective. i feel that i know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, i that i have no need to further analyze my thoughts. i am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. i'm sure that my high school english teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences i started with ""i"". although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word ""saw"". did you notice that i also spelled out the word eight. it has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. i hope that this writing is still here when i come back. i'm back. that took about a minute. sorry. i meant to right one minute. i wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. i wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? i wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? i feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. i feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. as this assignment comes to an end i wonder what i was supposed to have learned, for i feel that i am none the wiser. twenty minutes have now passed. the end.

"when i was young, i always like to lied. i remember one day i lied to my mother that i went to library to study. but instead, i went to the nearest video game center to play arcade. when come back from home, i told my mother that i study very hard in the library. after i said that, my grandmother smile at me for a moment which last for about few seconds. at that time, somehow i got strange feeling that something is wrong, but i am not very sure about that. i kept thinking about the wicked smile that my grandmother gave it to me within that two or three seconds. then i decided to analyse this situation carefully. first, when i lied to mother at that moment, did i carelessly show any sign of unordinany behavior, like shaking my body or showing a very dishonest face without i knowing it. second, did i say something wrong or stupid, that have indirectly showed me i am lying at that moment. third, did my clothes have any cigarette smell? or did some of the people saw me enter the video game center and tell the incident to my mother? or is it my grandmother just want to smile and being nice to me, and i am the one who is too sensitive about the smiling incident? even though i made many hypothesis, but i still could not figure if something is really wrong. i am kind of nervous and just keeping thing that incident. after dinner, my mother asked me why does it take me so long to finish my study, and i told her i have a lots of homework to do. then she said i was lying because my sister had followed me and seen me enter the video game store. at last, this incident had ended, and it also prove me that my six sense is correct.

"the day has flown by, work computer science homework, but it was a nice day, i was wearing black which was dumb because the sun was shining and it was really hot. u know about how black seems to attract the most colors or that the most colors get absorbed so it actually makes everything hotter. plus i was wearing jeans which made it worse, i would have actually preferred to wear shorts but going to work on the first day wouldn't have been smartest with dressing so casually know what i mean? but anyways back to the point. i met some interesting people today. i talked to kevin for a while actually only a couple of sentences i had to go soon. but i wanted to go to the ta to see if he can help me with my cs homework turned out he wasn't there. don't know where he went. but i don't care tho. actually i did, u know how things seem to be worse when nothing seems to be going ur way? well it's almost quiet right now, i think the crickets are chirping which is horrible because its really annoying. typically i'm not a violent person. but it's something about crickets. i have no idea. i don't know what it is. sarah is asking what it is and she was checking to see if it was the ac i hope that the crickets aren't in the room, it's like frogs croaking at nite before u go to sleep or the heater going on. but it's hard to concentrate with all that noise. but i think i can manage. anyways what was i talking about? oh yeah my cs homework, i came back from work and just asked eric for some help since he has a computer i went at around one thirty becuase i came back at around one from work grabbed my computer and talked to kevin and then went down to blanton to see marty play the piano, i just asked him to come with me to painter. good! finally the chirping has stopped some guy is banging on the ac poor crickets. but it's finally stopped cool!! anyways i went to the dorm room in jester which was a fifteen minute walk. fifteen minutes sometimes is a long way but not when ur determined. fifteen minutes is to gregory gym, which is good but sometimes when i'm walking to rlm it seems like it'll take forever and i'm just five minutes away, why does it seem to be so far? i needed to take a break sometimes. which is totally weird. oh well. hmm. there's a coke can around me and it's been there for a couple of nites actually only around three days or around two. martin got it for me the day before and i just decided to leave it in the fridge. i should probably just recycle it. the recycling bin isn't that far away. only like a two second walk actually around one minute. more or less. give or take a few it's near the trashcan and stuff it's kept in the washing room. it has a washing machine and a dryer and also it has like a sign-up sheet so that people can get to it easier instead of waiting u just take a time period of around three hours u know? anyways it's an iron board in there and a broom and mop. which reminds me that the room is getting dirty. looking at the computer it looks really cool. it's miniature, i almost didn't want to get it because sony is discontinuing it and u know i thought there was something with it. i don't know. u know that most people don't want stuff that's going out. but this is a silver and metallic purple color. i was at work for an hour just sorting out papers of different colors there was buff, metallic orange, canary yellow and all these various colors which is strange because there are the brites and the normal colors which are paler. but i'm already done. so guess this is the end.

"i am starting over again. i am real mad. i was about 15 min into my first writing and i clinked on some link and this page transferred to somewhere else and everything was lost. that sucks. that sucks. that sucks. i do not know what else to write. frustration. nothing is more annoying. last year at 4 am in the morning my computer froze. i lost 3 or 4 pages of work for a a research paper that was do the next morning. that was infuriating. maybe almost cried. probably not. about as angry at myself as i have ever been though. bloodied my hand on a wall i was so mad then. i'm not angry enough now to hit anything. it is only twenty minutes and i have done nothing all day. the link i clicked was so stupid. it was in my friends profile. quotes from my calc teacher last year. they weren't funny when i read them. i knew they wouldn't be anyway. but i had to click on the damn link. wish i could get that moment back. about one hundred quotes and not one was funny. the kid who made this list of quotes has way too much time on their hands. not that i don't. it is 4 in the afternoon and the only time i have been out of my dorm is too get food. nothing else so far. that is pretty sad. staring and tvs and computer screen hurts my eyes. throbbing is only word i can think of to describe my feeling. feel like going back to bed. i sleep way too much. winamp. music. weezer. play. el scorcho. god damn you half japanese girls. do it to me every time. all the red heads said you shred the jello and i'm jello baby. two won't talk won't think of me. i'm the epitome. i can't keep up typing the song lyrics. i had it going good for a while. i asked you to go to the green day concert. you said you never heard of them. i'm not going to tey and type lyrics anymore. i'm not in the mood for weezer. stop. change. bela fleck. something anyone can always listen too. no lyrics to tey and type at least. locks of dread. i hear drums and some weird keyboard type instrument. i'm not really sure. definitely a bass and maracas or something of that nature. not important. great song. i feel better. one of few songs that can make me feel better by listening to. i wonder how many words i spelled wrong'typos. go back and check. no. ha. not that important. this is my stream of conscious. i don't think this is working. would i normally think about these things if i was not trying to record thought. only thing i think i am really thinking about is what i am thinking or what i should think next. maybe not. i confused myself. somehow i went to a page of lines or something. when i went back my time clock started at zero again. i am going to have to estimate my twenty now. why my page went squiggly line. i have no idea. i hate computers, they think they can just do whatever they want. freeze throw pop ups at you, turn off, and a million other things. machines will take over. judgment day is near. no. but terminator 2 could be greatest movie of all time. my occupation is to do what i like - this os my friends away message. a lyric of a song we both think is hilarious. glad to see him with that away message. the stars are bright and big at night - deep in the heart of texas ( clap clap clap) pee wee hermans big adventure. a lot better than big top pee wee. my friend just send me instant message: do you have a pic of prof account. "" he is mad i don't understand him. i'm sorry but i don't. me means a pickaprof. com account. i have never even heard of this. should i have. i have no idea. i guess i don't really care. well after accidentally hitting back my time is messed up again and i am going to say it has been twenty minutes. i wonder if i did this right. were these thoughts too forced.

"i wonder if anything is going to come to mind as i am supposed to do this assignment. it is really hard for me to do something when i am put on the spot, such as this assignment asks me to do. what can i possibly write about the 20 minutes i have that will be enough to satisfy the professor. i wonder why there are braille letters on drivethrough atm machines. it was a coincidence that i mentioned that to my friend and then in family relationships the professor mentioned it. what do i have to do today? i have a crapload of math that i have been putting off that is due wednesday. i still have half of it to finish and i swear to myself that i will finish it today, but i know that i will keep on putting it off until i have to stay up most of the night to finish it the day before. i never stay up to late though, unless it is a project that i am really into and i will spend the little time that i have to really do my best on it. on other stuff like math or something i am less passionate about i won't care what grade i will get, i won't stay up past 1:00am on a project i am not interested in. ah, a procrastinators life. but well, i am not sure if it will work for me in college. in high school i did just fine, but i am not sure about college. i guess i will have to wait until my first tests to decide if i should change my ways, but looking at it realistically, i probably will not. i always tell myself to do this or change that, and i do for that week but i always know i will go back to being the same thing i try so many countless time to change. i really want to be like my roommate. she studies all the time, but like my friend cindy said yesterday, she is one of those people who really has to try hard to get good grades. she doesn't think i am one of those people, she isn't. but honestly i would not want a doctor that never cracked a book open until the day before a test and made all as to be my doctor. if she ever decides that is what she wants to be. she is always changing her major, but she is going to med school, at least that is what she says. i don't know what i want to be. i am confused. i tell her i want to be a vet, and then she reminds me of the day i almost vomited when coda, my dog, took a crap in my room. if i can't stand dog crap, how am i going to be a vet. i just realized that i have to pee, but i still have 4 more minutes to write and then check my spelling, i think i am just going to submit it like this, he said so himself that it will be graded if i have done the assignment, not my spelling. i just realized that i have changed the subject. i always to that. somebody could be talking about homework and i will bust out saying ""look a my new sandals. "" i think aloud too much. oh, yeah. ok. i also said i wanted to be a marine biologist and she reminded me how afraid i am of sharks. i don't know what she is trying to do to me.

"in high school i felt smart. now i just am a face lost in the crowd. there are so many peole-so unfamiliar. what will i do? all my friends went to different colleges. the only new people i know are my roomates-and they all have friends from high school to hang with. i feel like an outcast, like an ugly, fat, freshman, high schoolish girl. even in my pledge class, all the other girls know each other from camp or home or watever. i have made friends though. i feel like my story is a depressing one, but i really am a happy person and i am enjoying college-being away from home. i thought that coming to college i would somehow escape the whole social thing. obviously there is no escaping society. i was a debutante, neches river festival grand lady-in-waiting, senior class vice-president, and so much more. i was shown in the ""higher"" society. i hated it some, i liked it some. i guess i mainly liked the in control feeling and the attention. i went to public school, not private like most all of the people who came here from beaumont, so i really am not friends with mopst of the people i know. the girls i know-from home and in my pledge class-all live in hardin house. i live in towers. there again, i feel like an outcast. i feel that somehow these girls look down on me. it seems like all the girls from hardin house are all so close-and i am not allowed to be a part of their ""group. "" sometimes i just want to go home and be with my friends-where i felt i belong. i am excited to be in college, but-now i'm crying-but anyway, i just feel too young. but going home would show a weakness-i can't go home-i can't show that i want to or have an interest. i have always been the strong hard-headed type that doesn't show emotions. i was sick of being at home-i like it here, but it's hard-school that is. i want to do good in school and show my parents and grandparents-that i am a worthy person and i can survive-on my own. i really am happy, but i guess it is just cold feet. it is just going to take some time to adjust and become a sociable person, again. i know i can do it-make my grades and everything-even if it means giving up a party, or two or ten. i will make it and i will succeed. i am forever changing and growing up, but i need to find who i am -as an individual and on my own rather than hide behind the shadow of my comfort zone.

"i don't know where to start. my mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. ut is great but i am not sure where i fit into things right now. it is really just one big cycle for the time being. when i was driving here from arlington, my dad told me that i would not hang out with any of the people i already knew because you will ""drift apart. "" but i like my friends. i have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. i also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. the three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. for me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. constantly. i want to fit in somewhere, but i am not sure i want to pay for it. it really is strange. all this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. speaking of study, i have nothing to do but read. no busy work. just reading. that kind of reading will fry your brain. this has been a weird week. everything has changed. school, friends, family (or lack of). it is kind of cool, though. i am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. it is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. i simply want it to be easy. i guess that is what college is for. it teaches you to grow up. now i have laundry to do. just another fun thing to do. it really sounds negative, but my life is good, i guess. just finished that 32 page questionnaire. while most of it was simple, it really does make you think. especially when it asks, ""are you certain about your answers?"" who knows? do you like yourself? of course. are you sure? yep. i guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. that never crosses my mind. it is too much fun to live. challenging experiences though. sure wish ut would have won yesterday. it was great yesterday. went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. that just kind of ruins the whole effect. back to the frat thing. we were supposed to go to party for the sigma chi's after the game. i really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. most of the guys are cool. but i think i am going to wait. they all say it is best to join 1st semester, but that is what ""they"" say. i believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. i guess. i think i just need to meet more girls. that would make life much more enjoyable. that has got to be the answer. i have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. but at that point, i never knew the difference. now it is hard. i think it is because of insecurity. i am really not afraid to admit it. i am insecure in meeting girls, but i will have to grow out of it. for now, i just wish i didnt have to read so much. it isn't that bad, just boring. you cannot retain 40 pages of economics in one day. it is just not possible. but i guess i will try my best.

"it is wednesday. i can't wait until friday because i am going home to see brandon. i miss him so much. i can't wait to see him. two more days. this has been a very long two weeks. time passes very slowly here. i have a lot of free time on my hands when i am not in class. class. psychology class. psychology is fun so far. it really interests me, and prof. pennebaker is funny. chapter two sort of scared me though. how am i going to remember all of those terms. i didn't even finish reading it because i didn't understand it. but i should have becasue matt said that it was interesting. he was telling me about how they cut some part of a cat's brain out in an experiment. that is weird. the poor cat. matt is weird too. i always wonder if he likes me. he can be so mean when other people are around but so nice when it is just the two of us. i did feel pretty uncomfortable around him today in class. it was weird to sit right next to him. those seats are so close. i wish christina was not dropping psychology. i need her. i was so excited that we would have a class together. i feel like she ditched me. i guess i will get used to that because she is an architect. oooo. i guess i am a little jealous because she will have all of her architect friends, and who will i have? hmmm. also architecture sounds so much smarter than education or communication. communication. if i even get in. how am i ever going to get an appopintment with that leslie thomas? she will never call me back. i will just go tomorrow morning and wait until she is free like mc told me. and bring a book. and sit and wait. i will feel so dumb. why am i so nervous about talking to her? why am i nervous about typing this? i don't want to be in philosophy. it is too hard. i am not smart enough. i don't know. i wonder if that was really tobin i saw today in psychology. it looked like him. as much as i remember him. that is so weird. why do i keep thinking about him. i only talked to him once. i will probably never see him again. i don't know if i will even go to philosophy tomorrow. i want to see him again. why do i want to see him again? that is weird. i feel guilty for thinking aabout another guy. what about brandon? i still like brandon. love him. i miss him. i want to see him. i don't want anyone else but him. i wish he was here with me. then i would not feel so alone. alone. junior senior freshman. i am a freshman. it is so obvious. why? because i look young? becasue i look scared? like i don't know where i am where i am going what i am doing. that i don't belong. i don't belong. it will take time. this is like high school but worse but better. i was so scared freshman year in high school. i hated lamar. but i didn' want to go anywhere else. brandon. i wish we went to the same high school. that would be cool. every time i see a couple i think of him. i miss him. i am so pathertic. alden. was he right? he made me so mad. he can be so rude. why are we friends? he can be nice. he is older. smarter. meaner. mean. hmmm how much time left time time time. passes slowly when you think about it. i should nopt think about it. i have a whole year here without brandon. this dorm. it smells. our bathroom smells. the cafeteria smells. my eye hurts i wnat to take my contacts out i don't want to meet guys with gina and erin. what is there obsession. i think about it too much. so do they. when you think aobut it nothing happens. when you don't something does. i think aobut not thinking about it. fate destiny. god. i wish i was a better person. i wish that i had a better relationship with god. i wish that i was happier. i wish i was a little buit taller. that is a stupid song. just like that money on my mind song that reminds me of jimmy moore. i hate him.

"well, i'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that i know i have to do this. just got back from school and had lunch. my whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. i cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. i've left the tv on. i always like to watch something as i eat. something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. it's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. i've always wondered about the concept of time. how it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. i have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. i'm not getting old so much as i had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. i was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to san marcos to do some shopping. my boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. what a nasty shock!. at least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. i left the tv on way too loud. funny how i sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others i love background noises. leave the tv on just for ""company"". talk about true desperation. csi is on. love the show. absolutely fascinating. i am such a tv addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. got an exam coming up on monday, got to start studying for that. hope it's not too tough. gosh, i really miss home and family. it's tough being away in a foreign land. i can't wait to get back to sydney and singapore. i am so looking forward to my trip in europe at the end of the year. i am so excited about vienna and italy. i love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. it was hot out today. i'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. the ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. i'm glad i missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. like winter so much better. i'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in europe. have to admit that i don't really know what else to talk about. i just know that i want to shower after this but knowing me, i'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the csi marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so i can continue the moving process. my new apartment needs a lot of tlc before it will be in tip top shape. then again, only about three more months till i leave the states and am back on the road to canada, europe, asia then australia. this year has been a most trying one. but i know that i am a stronger and wiser person for it. i've been through so much in life, but i know there's so much more. i'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in harvard before i leave and a family friend in new york. my body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. maybe i won't need'want that fan after all. there's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. i am almost there, just 2 more minutes left. i really need to focus my time and attention on what i'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. i'm actually speaking as i type. is that normal? or more precisely, that's normal for me. i wonder what professor pennebaker would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. ok. back to csi.

" how much time do i have before i need to do some more homework. this week is going to be pretty busy. it is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. all the teachers should use the same service. this would make it much easier for students to keep up. my goal is not to fall behind, but i have missed some classes of geology. i need to find out what i missed. that class is going to suck. i wish i had a car so that i could get places farther than a mile away. i hate writing. i hate typing. it is hard to write down everything you think. our minds work 5 or 6 times faster than one can type or speak. so if we could talk faster, we could get up to 5 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. this would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. i'm glad my spider bite went away. it sucked that i had to go to the health center for it. they gave me a shot in my ass. it left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. it just sucked that it was on my face. it made me nervous when i heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because i had been putting it on for many days. thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. i spend much time alone now that i moved away. luckily i enjoy being by myself. it is nice to have the peace and quiet. the parties are fun, it is just that i would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that i don't know. i don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports i have played. i do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. it seems barbaric to use ones instincts ",1,0.365294 -1.264263 0.001596 -1.216074 -0.78248 -0.108673 0.059389 -0.620552 -0.535019 -1.24175 -0.195944 -0.590446 1.780423 0.755317 -0.533559 0.0 -0.04277 -0.068004 -0.660398 1.078811 -0.406257 -0.287132 -1.076314 0.154906 -0.624052 0.184702 0.430138 0.180811 1.945916 1.036245 1.661491 -0.756561 1.724177 -0.089284 2.313854 2.578835 0.166182 -0.487813 -0.463025 0.687241 0.077884 0.41928 -1.584342 -1.192872 -0.79853 0.019339 -1.093488 -0.582959 0.71502 -0.465417 -0.85266 -0.323433 1.109884 0.781435 -1.283883 1.540646 0.523493 1.542153 -1.680774 1.126371 0.197695 -0.415617 0.403077 0.058529 2.650833 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.464116 -0.089644 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.975636 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.413525 4.455611 3.600065 4.073116 4.353161 5.557079,2297
"if i were to fly to pennsylvania to see julia, brint and i would have to go together, it'd cost a hell of a lot but maybe for spring break or something we could go. she says it's really pretty up there, it gets really cold too. i hate the cold weather. i have an image in my head of these nice clean streets, kind of hilly, in autumn with all the leaves changing colors and falling on the ground. she says it's supposed to be beautiful, like a carpet. and we'd go see vicky in philly. though we'd have to take the train, all sorts of new stuff. but i won't get to see her until christmas and i know i won't be able to go before that. she's going to disney world before christmas so i won't even get to see her much then either. i've never been to disney world or disneyland or anything. all i want is some of those mickey mouse ears and to ride the teacup ride. i told cassandra in eighth grade or our freshman year or something that when she went to get me some and i'd pay her back but she never got them. i wish we still would have been friends just a little more in high school. i mean i realize that the whole little group broke up when we got to high school but still. i really wish i was still good friends with andrea. i miss her so much sometimes. she's dating some guy now that i don't even know, i didn't even know she was dating someone. we used to be such good friends, inseparable. i practically lived at her house an entire summer and we did everything together. then i left her and she went off and became ""popular"" or whatever. which pisses me off because i when we got to high school she was fat and not that pretty and now all of a sudden she's miss beauty queen and she's too good to hang out with me. not that we would have anything in common these days and i guess it is my own fault for the way things went. but i just wish i would have gotten to share some of those high school things with her. i miss her so much. it's really weird because i have all these best friends, like 5 or 8 and its not like i ever thought about her much in high school. every once in a while, but now that i'm here it seems that i miss her more, i haven't really thought about her any more than normal i guess. although right before i left, for a couple of days i thought about her a lot and i really wanted to email her a letter of some sort, kind of apologizing i guess for the way things went between us. they didn't go bad or anything, they just kind of went away. i think i still might email her. the reason behind it all is jeremy. i talked to him the other day and it was weird. like it didn't feel weird at the time but now that i look back and think it was just weird. i 'd really like to see him again sometime soon. i don't know why because i know it probably won't be good for me. things are strange because if i'm not around him for a while i'll think about him and in an odd way miss him. but the second i get around him i suddenly realize why the hell i hate him so much and why i can't stand to be around him. i'm sure i have some underlying issues with all that that i just can't define or pick out. well i know i do, i dated the damn guy for three years of my life. three years of high school no less. my first real experiences are all owed to him. now that i look at it, it was probably a really bad idea, in know it was, to date him all while i'm just being introduced to things in the world. those are things i should have experienced on my own, not with him in my life. and plus i wasted 3 years of my life, there's no telling who or what would have happened in those three years. or who i would have become. which is the other aspect of it, i'm not sure which side i agree with more. because if it weren't for him i wouldn't be who i am today and i think for the most part i like who i am. and i had all these experiences with him and i learned so much and it just makes you wonder what would have happened and how would i have turned out if i hadn't dated him. i mean i'm glad i have all these experiences under my belt because i sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to come here without knowing a lot of the things i do, and i'm glad they were with somebody i ""loved"". but it just really gets to me to think, what if. i'm so curious to know how things would have gone if it weren't for him. and now i'm even starting to doubt my love for him. was i really in love or was i just fooled somehow? i'm sure i loved him as a person, and now i'm even starting to wonder about that too. maybe it's just the suppressed anger or whatever that makes me doubt my feelings for him, or maybe i just honestly didn't. but i was obviously feeling something at the time. and last time is so much different than this time. that's what brought on the whole questioning thing of do i really know what it is to be in love or am i just imagining these things?

"""today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what i remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. back then, i was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. but now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. i don't know what it was that did it. perhaps it was that one acid trip that i took at last year's phish concert. man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. makes you feel selfcritical. i don't know how i feel now. ever since this year began, i've been a little more tired than usual. but, i've been a little stressed out, too. not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. enjoyable, too. having sex with that girl sue was a bad move, though. first of all, she's kind of nuts. i know she's lonely, too. must be tough coming all the way from california here, but at least her family's from texas. she's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. it's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world i think. i mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. all those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. personally, i think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, i'm not an old man nor do i have a family to support. i hope this girl doesn't get racked up. i'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. and, i know that if i'd gotten some loving in the last three years i wouldn't have done it. i used her and i feel rotten for it. but, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, i fear. somehow, she identifies these two things with me. don't really know why, because i never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but i never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. man, i hate complaining, but i got to say that i've had some bad luck with women these last few times. first there was lexi. i'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but i'm sure i loved her in some way. can't speak from her end of the line, though. the problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, i was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. that's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can i say? i haven't really gotten that far yet, though lord knows i've tried. i was thinking the other day about whether or not i fear women overall. well, i sure like to talk and think about them a lot. my mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. i know she loved me a lot, although i hate to admit it, and i guess that's why she was. or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. anyway, nonetheless, i've been afraid of her forever and i'm ashamed because i think it fucks up my deal with other women and i really have a hard time deciding if i love her or not. i know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do i really? of course i do on some level, but, man, i always get all tearyeyed when i even start thinking about it. that's another thing: i haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. oh well, c'est la vie. my friend elizabeth comes to mind now. i wonder how she's doing up there in ny. we have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when i learned that she liked matt for a long time. guess i always had a little something for her. that was a great time up at the doubletree last christmas, though, i will say. mr. a footing the entire bill, too. i guess townes van zandt does have it right when he said, ""we all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" last night, i learned about some of manny's holes concerning his father. he sure has been acting differently lately, though. it must be tough, but i don't know how to handle it. maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. i kind of liked that emily girl i met last night as well. i guess that statistic that says that men think about sex'women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. or, maybe i just have some complex or something. probably a combo of the two. i don't know what to think about god these days. i sure have been praying a lot to him lately, though, over this sue pregnancy thing. god, i hope that works out for me. i know it's selfish, but, man, you've got to understand. i truly am sorry, and i'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. lord, hear my prayer. amen. our society's kind of funny these days. if there is a man upstairs, i hope he's having a good time. it's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. after high school, i mean. sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman i'm sure. i wonder who's got it worse. ""sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" it just so happens i'm tired of being a man, says octavio paz. i guess we all feel like that sometimes. well, i guess my 20 minutes is up, but i do like this. maybe we'll talk again sometime. see you, man. take care and good luck.

"far too many thoughts are running through my head right now. too many things changing all around me. my main concerm=n is matt. i know it is crazy for me to think that the two of us can stay together through the year but i want to so badly. he is my best friend and there is no way i can just let myself lose him. i am just so worried about everything. we are fighting an awful lot lately vecause we need to learn to get adjusted to all the new things around us. why in the world is he at rolla. he just settled there which makes me so diappointed because i want him to be happy. not just settling someweher cause he feels like he has no other choices. and then he goes on about there not being anyone there who doesn't drink and so in order to not be alone he hads to go out with these guys why can't he just gove it some time. he'll meet good people eventually. he just doesn't want to be alone like he was for most of high school. i can kind of understand because he spent so much time out of hat he considered the loop. i can't really say much because all my other friends are at ut. heck i'm even living with one of my best friends. i knew that would be a mistake but i just didn't have t eheart to turn her down so i siad we could be suitemates, not roommates. still a mistake. she is always in my business, never a moments peace. it doesn't help that she keeps aksing about matt. the sick part is that she has always liked hikm. he used to like her which makes it even worse. and she keeps trying to stay in contact with him which pisses me off. i know i can't tell him he can't talk with her but it seriuosly upsets me. especially cause she keeps busting in here asking me all kinds of questions about us. she doesn't know how much of a private person i am about certain things. if i want to talk i will share anythign under the sun. but i hate beign pressured to talk and i hate not having my space. she doesn't understand. i am a hard person to live with because i am so picky about everything. i like things my way. so livign with others is often hard. my roommmate and i get along great cause we give each other space while always being there for each other when we need it. it neat cause we hadn't met unitl last week and yet we already work on much the same level. so the whole lindsay thing just adds to the mess with matt. i am very insecure about him going away. really scared about the whole situation so it doesn;t help when i feel my best friend is after my man. i know he has nothing to do with it but why couldn't he just ignore her for me, for us. i know it is not good for us to fight like this and i don't want to but sometimes i just start expected too much. ridiculous things that no one can be expected to live up to. but that's the way i am, i figure if i can do it others should be able to too. on that i amn very wrong but it still bothers me. i want my baby to be happy and i don't want us to trap each other in a relationship that isn't healthy but i'm not ready to let go. i still think that if we just get settled it will all work itself out. i just can't have lindsay behind me all the time interupting our conversations. i just feel that he always has to go before we can really finish somehting. and then there are my parenst who are so weird. now that i am gone they try and contact me more. they i'm and email but never call. then they blame nme, why haven't you called. well first of all yall are tryign to see me more than you did while i was home, secondly, wy don't you call. that drives me crazy. i really don't miss anyone except matt. that isn't really suprising to me though because i have never been one to miss my family . and most of my really close friends are here. which is interesting in itself. ut is the last place i ever thought i would end up. i always wanted to go to rice and then on the last day i suddenly changed my mind. not sure all the reasons why. sometimes i say it is because ut had the program i wanted, at rice i really didn't have a major. but other times i think i was just too chicken. too chicken to pick the harder school. i knew i could handle it but i didn't know if i wanted too. then there were my parenst who for some reason pushed ut. not gform the beginning, but somewhere along the line, i think when my dad saw the scholarship. then he went form die hard rice to, ""i think you'd be better off at ut. "" i didn't want to do the same things my friends were doing. i wanted something new. and heere i am with one of my friends in the same room. now that is a stretch. my best friend other than matt is andrea and who knew but she pulle done of the same things and ended up at ut too. so really there is no one to miss except my baby and iz am takign that really hard. it's hard to believe i acn't see him until christmas. and talkign over the internet just isn't the same. i just want everything to settle down and my emotions to caslm down so that i am not so fickle with everything and don't act irrationally. i never mean to hurt him but judt today irealized that i have been. now as i talk it sounds like we shouldn't stay together but we have sommmuch fun tigether and i think that this is justa phase. we are both stressed. i hope my roommates don't get all weird on me and start thinkign i'm getting depressed. i really just need some space and a little time to adjust.

"rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now, i am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room. you see, my roommate carly is sleeping. she was fortunate to have no classes on friday. i on the other hand, have chemistry on friday mornings at 10. you understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away, often until long after i return. as is the case today, which is why i am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep. it's not that i need to sleep right now, it's the idea behind it--she sleeping while i am up and writing this paper. this paper by the way is the first of two papers i have been blessed to right today. this writing assignment is fun; it's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds. one word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time, very different direction. back to the second paper i'll be writing today. my ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday. we meet twice a week, one on tuesdays and once on thursdays. it is quite a walk to the nursing building. it is located at the far end of campus, so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus. but, i enjoy the class so the walk is manageable. ahh, all these pop ups keep coming while i am writing this. i really don't like the idea of pop ups. back to my paper. we discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class, all in preparation for the nursing field. it's hard to think of everything that we will one day face. that is, if we actually get accepted into the nursing program. it's pretty tough i believe. they don't accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program. i hope i get accepted. it seems to be the direction that god is pointing my towards. i don't now though; i think i need to have a couple more talks with him to see where he wants me and where i might serve him best. well, i'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity. so without further adew(i don't really know how to spell that word, but go with me on it) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology. i sure hope i accomplished the task at hand. it seemed easy enough. but i guess we'll see. my phone is ringing. i bet it is sterling.

"okay today is friday at 2:25 and at the moment i am wondering what i will be doing this weekend. i am going home on saturday with my best friend. my best friend is catherine, but now she prefers to be called cat. i have known her since i moved to kingwood (north of h-town) 5 years ago. she was my first friend and we have been through a lot together. we've also had our years of separation too. she lives a street away from me. i am listening to the cure. but the tape sucks because i used to listen to it in my car and my car's stereo sucked. now i don't even have that car. we sold it the weekend before i moved to austin. which brings me to the topic of austin. austin always seemed like such a cool place before i moved here. now that i actually live here, i wish i was back in houston. in houston i knew so many people and there was almost always something to do. and most of my friends stayed there. it's really fucking hard to meet people here since there are so many people. ironic. i have not given up yet. i guess i just have to go out more. hey psychology is my fav class. i hate math and chem is just like math to me. i used to like english in high school but now it's goofy stuff like ""everything's an argument"". i bought some ginseng today and i donot think it works. i am still tired. i am looking around my room for things to talk about because thoughts do not pop into my head unless i am looking around. i just remembered i have been having really fucked up dreams. last nite i had my 2nd weird dream. in the first one i almost died and everyone acted really strange. my second dream a lamb was killed in front of me. and there was some blue gel that was everywhere. i can't really explain it and it would take too long and i have only 8 minutes left. since i am a slacker and only do the minimum 20. i drank sobe lizard blizzard today and it was good. i think it was pina colada. right before i did this assignment, someone called and i could not understand them because the were those people who mumble. anyways i thought they were doing a survey so i went ahead and cooperated. well it turns out i was filling a visa credit card application over the phone and she told me i would get my card in a couple of weeks. i thought it was funny because i do not want a credit card and was going to tell her at the end but i decided not to. maybe she will get a bonus for getting a customer. i hope i am doing this assignment right. i did something like this in my high school english class. she had us smell crayons and write the first thoughts that came into our head. and thats what i did except everyone else seemed to have the same thoughts (thoughts about elementary, art school, projects). the crayons did not spark up any thoughts about my childhood. so i hope this writing assignment isn't supposed to spark some certain thoughts. supasticious.

"i usually don't let too many things get to me because i just want to enjoy life. i think that there are a lot of interesting and wonderful things that each person is offered in their life time and i think that it is a shame if people don't take advantage of the things that they are given. at this moment, i am happy and cheerful and i don't have anything that is bothering me. it rained today and i didn't like it, but i wasn't too upset about it because i figured that we could use the rain. it also felt cool outside so the rain really didn't bother me too much. i also have a lot of homework that i need to get done, but i think that i have handled the stress very well. even though i have many different things to do, i have tried to pace myself and organize myself as to where i have less tension in my life. i try to organize myself based on what i think is convenient and this helps me be a more efficient person, and thus causes me to stay in a pretty good mood. during the past three weeks i have often thought about the new life that i live here at ut. it is completely different from high school, and even though it has taken a lot of adjustment on my part, i am beginning to see the benefits of college and i am beginning to enjoy myself a little more. at first i was really scared about attending college. i don't think it was anything specific about college, just the whole concept of moving away from home and being without the people that i love most in my life. but, since the beginning of school, i have been able to cope with this type of anxiety a little better and i feel that even though i have left home, i have a chance to start a whole new life here at ut. i will always be able to see the people that i love and i have accepted the fact that i will be able to see them whenever i want, and this has helped me in enjoying the college life better. there aren't very many different feelings that i usually feel in a day. for the most part, i am usually in a pretty good mood and i see myself as a fun person to be around. i try not to let the little things bother me, because i see so many people who let the small things in life ruin their entire day. my philosophy is why let one bad thing ruin all the good things that you have in life. this is why i usually try not to let too many things bother me or stress me out, it just takes all the fun out of life. i think that happiness is also a choice, people who are happy choose to be happy. they don't let too many things interfere in their lives and this helps them be happy with themselves, happy with those who are around them, and happy with the lives that they live. i choose to be happy everyday, and one of my short-term goals for each day is to end the day on a happy note. i think that it is important to end each day in a happy state of mind, otherwise your gloomy mood just carries over to the next day. when i have to evaluate my feelings, i would like to think that i am in a good mood most of the time and that people are happy to be around me. i enjoy making people's lives a little bit more fun for them. being happy is a very important aspect of my life and i think that happiness will help me achieve my goals and it will help me lead a happy and prosperous life. i hope to be happy with myself and have others around me be happy with me as well. i think that happiness brings success in your life. i think that if one is happy, then he is successful as well.

"right now, i'm thinking about my physics lab and the fact that i did really poorly on that lab. i need to maintain a good gpa in order for me to get into the business school, and i don't want my lab grade to impede my admission. but even if i do get into the business school, do i really want to do something in that field? i mean i didn't declare a major at first because i didn't want to commit myself too soon to a field of study. i've always been interested in music. i do want to major in that but my parents aren't that fond of the field. so either i double major, which is impossible in the business school, or i don't do what i really want to do--that is major in music. no matter what i major in, i will have to maitain a very good gpa throughout college since i want to study abroad in england--the country where i've always wanted to live. mainly because of the fact that it is home to my favorite sport of all time--cricket. no one really knows about the sport here. i wish a lot more people did know about it so they could relate to the joy that i feel while watching the sport. i guess to enjoy a particular sport, or anything for that matter, u have to be born in that environment. back in pakistan, everyone loves the sport and it's like a religion. i sure do wish that pakistan had won the world cup in june. all that hard work went out the window when they played so poorly in the final. anyway, i hope to become a cricketer myself in the future. but that's not a career that is looked upon as being a good one. and the cricket board in pakistan is really a mess. a lot of good players are neglected because they don't have connections with members of the board. i have a cold and i've been sneezing since all day yesterday. god it's so painful to sneeze 24 hours a day. i took a dayquill last night but even dayquills seem to make me drowsy. now, on top of the sneezing, i have to deal with trying to stay awake in my classes. i'm waiting for my roommate to come so we can go eat. gosh i hate the food in jester. i mean it's the same old stuff everyday. at times like this, i really miss home and my mom's cooking. the weather over here today is pretty good. better than the previous month has been. i want to go play golf but i don't know where any of the golf courses are. i guess i'll ask my roommate's friend who plays golf.

"this is my first writing assignment. i'm watching cosby on tv. i have a headache. i've had a headache most of today. i woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep. i had a stomach ache and felt like i was going to be sick. i had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so i got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good i think for breakfast. i think from now on on mwf i'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. i was supposed to have a study group tonight but i called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but i don't really need it. i think i'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. i had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the ap test so i'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since i'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. i was thinking about switching majors to psych cause i really enjoyed everything i learned in high school when i took it. i don't know if i'll switch over though yet. i'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day i've felt like crap and i miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since i've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 2 1'2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. i'd come home every weekend if i had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. i'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. i don't care about the experience. i'm here to learn and i do that during the week. i do all my homework when i need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't i come home and spend my time with the one person i want to spend time with. well i know people here that have offered me rides so i can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause i spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on i'll get rides home from other people so i can spend my time with who i want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. i feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how i feel. i love my mom and everything, but i'm not really close to her at all, and i've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and i am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. i'm so close to mariko and i love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. i've been thinking about going next summer. i'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and i'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise i wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then i've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. i really want to go. my mom's really against the religion i've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and i hate how she feels. but through religion i've learned how to deal with all these feelings and i'm comforted now and i forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. i'm kind of tired and i still have a headache. i want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time i checked, and right now i don't want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out. i don't' feel like a sprite either, i could go down to san jac again. i think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. i need to move around more or something i guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and i can't stand it. i put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and i put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so i guess i won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but i don't think it matters. oh well. i have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. i like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. i miss her so much. i hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. i don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. i wish i could help her more but there's not much i can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason i want to be home still. so i can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and i call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then i have classes at certain times so i can't just leave and call her. but i'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so i don't think i'll get a couple calls in this week. i'll call on the weekend though since i won't be going home this weekend. hopefully i meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. i seem to be the youngest person there. and i'm already not a talkative person, so i think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 10 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well.

"i'm thinking that i should probably be doing some homework right now. but i am enjoying listening to the music that she is playing. that is one thing i miss about not driving anymore. i don't get to listen to music all the time. it is really weird not having a radio in my room, i even find myself just purposely stalling around the bathroom in my dorm longer than normal just so i can listen to the radio that is in there. i am starting to realize how random my thoughts are. as many times i have joked around about it but i really think that i have add. now i am thinking that i really need to call this girl back. she called while i was eating dinner with a friend over at kinsolving. i think that i am purposely stalling before calling her back. she asked for my number at this club, but everytime i think about i can't get over the fact that i kind of met someone at a club and the fact that stereotypes are funny. she is this kind of manly lesbian who is in the army and everytime i think about i just think it is really funny. now i am thinking about my roommate and that she listens to good music. she is playing third eye blind"", which is my favorite band. now i'm trying i'm remembering that this is the 3rd track on their 2nd album, ""blue"". now i'm trying to restrain myself from singing the song for the reason that i don't want to distract my roomie from studying or scare her with my terrible singing. now i'm thinking that i really need to break'stop this clock thing of mine from beeping 8 minutes past every hour. i used to just ignore it but now it is really starting to bother me. i should find the instruction manual that or throw it away, i don't have patience for those kind of things, which is actually kind of terrible considering that i am currently an engineering major. now i can't help ignoring the knot in my stomach, i'm nervous about something but i can't really narrow it down. i think it is a combination of calling this girl and the mostly ever present stress and pressure i feel from the whole classes'college thing. i'm really glad that prof. pennebaker taking about that in class today (that it is normal for college freshman to feel this way) i thought i might just have been being really weird and stressing out, which isn't too normal during this time of year. there is something about switching from the summer mode to school mode that always seems to stress me out. now i just seem to be spacing out and not really thinking about anything. i'm trying to figure out if i am really tired or if it is just the stress that is making me feel this way. but at least it is a pleasant break the ""dissecting my life"" thoughts that i have been having lately. for the last two days i have been trying to figure out whether my lack of a party life was caused by me being a mature high schooler or my me just being naive. i'm starting to realize that i think i need to cut ties with my dad again. the drama just isn't worth it. i think he . sorry i'm distracted. my roomie is playing the ""turning japanese song"". now i just had a vision of my mom dancing and singing this song. ohh, more 80's music michael jackson's ""beat it"". wow, he is such a freak now. anyway. where was i? oh ",1,-0.270433 0.083926 -0.596625 -0.199356 -0.415171 -0.319904 0.606594 0.262892 0.537035 -0.120901 -0.124807 -0.222594 -0.356327 0.747668 0.459152 0.0 -0.04277 0.084374 0.572964 -0.795527 0.390293 -0.742368 -0.313788 -1.036013 -0.624052 0.211538 0.264465 -0.365078 0.162006 -0.375437 -0.358019 -1.430891 0.663762 2.166971 -0.719484 -0.712849 0.026077 -0.644108 1.108313 -0.672944 1.361984 0.527814 -1.031708 0.16836 -0.751204 0.976059 -0.126724 -0.492813 0.451212 -0.87162 -0.815585 0.559083 -0.709662 -0.319553 -1.028721 -0.270198 -0.985486 -0.283342 -0.812538 1.716136 -1.250551 0.309899 -0.480161 -0.313196 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.362107 -0.603159 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.316587 -0.37208 -0.337085 2.889982 0.204341 0.510329 0.443721 -0.255338 4.41546 4.066496 4.788418 4.916505 4.724248,2198
"well, here i go writing a stream of consciousness. i am starving right now. all i have eaten today are cookies and queso with chips. the timer clock at the top of this page is bothering me, i don't know why, but it is distracting me from writing. my boyfriend is going to his ranch tomorrow. i wish he did not go every weekend because it sucks for me to be here without him. the electric bill is so expensive that we received today. i am out of money. well not out, but out of money that i can spend on random stuff. i miss my mom. i hope my grandpa is doing ok, he is very very sick. my eyes hurt. i don't like wearing my glasses. the fan is also irritating them. i am glad that its the weekend. i want a cool front to come through. i am so tired of being hot outside at school. i think i have a obsession with correct spelling. i know that this is supposed to be informal, but i cannot let a misspelled word go uncorrected. capitalization does not bother me, however, nor does some punctuation. i am the same way when i type online to my friends. i wonder if that means anything significant. probably not. i want a dog. i wish i lived in a complex that allowed pets. next year i will get one, hopefully. i want to adopt one from the spca or the pound. they are just as nice as ones from breeders, as well as cheaper, and they need a home more than the others. geez, this timer makes the time seem to go by more slowly. its like that saying my mom always says, 'a watched pot never boils. ' similar at least. i want a good book to read. i hate how i have so much reading homework from my classes that i do not have time to read for pleasure. oh well, maybe i'll find the time once i get more settled in to the routine of school. i need to do laundry. i have no clean clothes to wear, and i dropped grape jelly on my favorite jeans yesterday. i hope that it does not stain. i don't know what to day now. its so weird, i know that the brain never stops working, but if you try to identify your thoughts sometimes you draw a blank. its like you caught your mind off-guard. like when your boyfriend asks you what you're thinking about, and its really only what you had for lunch that day, but he is expecting something more romantic than that because he thinks he is being romantic and sincere by asking the question. so maybe when you have to say immediately what you are thinking at that moment and you don't have an answer, maybe your subconscious is just embarrassed because it was just thinking about something insignificant. ok, that whole little tangent probably made no sense to anybody except myself. oh well. i am tired of typing. my hands are out of shape. how sad. my whole body is out of shape. i hate living on the third floor of my apartment complex. the stairs are killing me. i didn't realize how out of shape i was until i had to move in and carry all my stuff up a million flights of stairs. my chair is too low and i can't figure out how to make it go up higher because there aren't any knobs or levers. its hurting my wrists. well, my right wrist to be specific. i hate it when people have something they want to say and they just don't know how to be direct about it. 'beating around the bush' that is so annoying. just get the words out. mmmm. i am so hungry. i want a burrito. or some queso. or both at the same time. i love mexican food. its good stuff. i would like a margarita too. that would be nice. i hope that i can transfer into the college of communications. that would be awesome. i hope that i succeed in advertising. i think that i would do a good job, but there are so many good and creative people at ut, all wanting to do the same thing as me. i hope that i have a fighting chance. i know that i have the work ethic to do well, but as far as creativity, i am uncertain if i measure up to the industry standard. wow, the time is up. that went by fast.

" yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 10 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like shut up. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i really feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well i've finally caught up with you now and i've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that i've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 5! it just really pisses me off. and he tells me how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes so lazy. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 50 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have me on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all the crap my roommate uses. dang the phone is ringing now and i can't concentrate anymore on what i was saying. anyways. yeah so i just want to be like, why don't you get off your lazy, pardon my language ass, and get a freakin job and stop mooching off of all your daddy's money. its not like his parents are rich either, he just thinks he is. on top of that he is sooo vain. everything on him and around him is so perfect. sometimes i wonder if hes a girl at heart or if he just loves looking at himself in the mirror. god if only i was brave enough to tell him how i really feel. it wouldn't be so bad except for the fact is that its my freaking apartment too and my best friend, though i love her to death, is living with us. its like nightmare that never ends. you know those feelings when you are a third wheel and you just want to get the hell out? can you imagine it like 24'7. its horrible. it just makes you want to crawl in a hole and die. come on i pay for the freaking apartment the least she could do is stop mooching off of us and possibly go home? jeez. on the topic of being a third wheel. i have this issue with two guys. im seeing this guy in houston that i like alot since my last boyfriend who totally broke my heart. lets say the guy im dating now is bob, and my ex is paul. so bob is like so sweet and hes alot older than me and i miss him a whole lot. at the same time paul who now goes to school with me, the reason we broke up is a long story, well we are becoming good friends. i never expected the thing with bob to actually happen over the summer and so now i have this like guy who i don't know exactly what we are but is considered a long distance relationship. bob has been nothing but sweet to me and i love him, actually wait another thing he doesn't want me to tell him that i love him either. i mean maybe i do and maybe i don't. so yeah, me and paul have become best friends again after our whole breakup and his cheating on me with the girlfriend he had, but then calling me to tell me two weeks before school started back up that he had broken up with her. come on now, i haven't talken to paul in like forever then he calls me to tell me hes broken up with his girl friend. strange yes. but i've told myself that i've gotten over with him after being his girlfriend for two and half years. thats a long time to spend on one person. so yeah he came over yesterday to hang out with me while i was waiting for the time warner roadrunner dudes to come over and me and paul started watching a movie together. he started getting closer and closer to me but i was like woah arent we just friends. so i get up to get a drink, come back to my room and lay down on my bed. paul sits on my back and starts giving me a friendly back massage and all the while i was thinking that i really miss him and that i wouldn't mind getting back together with him. at this time bob hadn't called me since sunday night and i was getting really worried. so i started relaxing and having a good ole time with paul. later that night bob calls and hes like hey sweetie, i miss you and im sorry i haven't called you but i've been really busy and i tried sending you and email but it didn't work. yeah so now im caught in this situation that i can't seem to get out of or fig ure out. should i go after my ex that is here in austin. or should i go after bob whose been nothing but sweet to me, but is back home. i don't know what i should do. and on top of all of this im sorta lonely, and i have alot of school work to take care and if i want a social life that not only that i can't seem to find ,and i have to work. i think that im slowly going insaine and this is too much things to think about for a person at my age. woah so yeah im going to stop now cause i've actually typed past the twenty min but i kind of feel better though ",0,-0.277168 0.2841 0.063156 0.201693 0.417494 -0.024908 -0.407173 -0.339417 -1.09916 2.488101 -0.11152 -0.217817 -1.667829 0.086267 -0.822877 0.0 -0.04277 0.000832 -0.53351 0.174785 -0.515827 1.496477 0.753557 0.096354 1.561679 -0.416228 -0.173214 0.772472 -0.357117 -0.534433 -0.02796 -0.034534 0.080494 -0.694621 -0.011814 -0.345608 -0.462453 0.212541 -0.769719 -0.227428 0.695421 -0.558281 0.422838 0.849331 -0.776214 1.287502 -0.007182 1.268194 0.913838 1.152106 -0.06746 0.473421 0.126708 -0.303212 -0.837827 1.62455 2.261689 1.953525 1.010663 0.6132 -0.943984 0.239477 -0.022924 0.50303 0.90162 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.463147 -0.447896 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.327325 -0.276855 -0.228067 -0.422267 -0.407926 -0.451544 -0.271929 -0.855623 5.258969 4.147534 4.541468 4.671441 4.664315,1661
" so right now i'm trying to hold myself together. i have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. i recently tryed out for texas sirits and shockingly i made the first cut. wow, out of 300 girls i was one of the eighty to be chosen. the bad news is that i have to do another creative project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. i hate money. people always say, money can't by you happiness but i beg to differ. if you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 10 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. it really is the little things for me though. i would like that extra size ice-cream. or another ut t-shirt. however, mr. budget steps in {a good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra perks of life. i'm sure i'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. ramen noddeles would go out of bussines. taco bell would close down. and sadly second hand stores would be no more. wow i really need to finish my project! its due in a couple of min. i feel like i'm allways rushing around. my life is one big traffic jam. how is this? maybe i take on too much. but other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. i wonder if people think i'm in control? ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! ok is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.

"writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time, but i have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health. so, maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal. i'm listening to music right now while i do this and it is actually kind of distracting me. its for my history of rock music class which is actually kind of boring, but i heard its going to get better. as i write this i notice how incredibly bad at typing i am. other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 20 minutes. i am going to have like a couple of paragraphs. that is really sad. now, i am thinking all psychological though. i am like oooooh, they are going to read this and think that i compare myself to other people. "" i do compare myself to people all the time. i am very competitive. my arms hurt already. i do badly on computers. i hate staring at the screen. when teachers make you read articles off of the computer, i always have to print it out-which is kind of annoying. i also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when i am not thinking about making it good. i am kind of surprised i made an a in rhetoric. i loved rhetoric. it was really interesting for me. all my classes this semester seem interesting. tough-but interesting. geology is weird. hopefully it will get better. i found out today that i could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking psychology 301. i am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically. so i am sad, but psychology 301 will at least be a good introduction. and now i sound like a suck-up because this is for psych 301. and now i sound like i care about what people think. i do though to some extent. ooooooh fun song on. that swing swing song by all-american rejects. i like it a lot. it reminds me of the summer. i wish i would've seen american pie three. i didn't even see the first or second one though-haha. my room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here. she is strange and different, but she is really unique and i like her a lot. she is never here though. her boyfriend goes to a&m-just like my boyfriend. she always goes to their games and never has even been to a ut game! i told her she should come to the arkansas game with me and she was like ""oh yeah! we played them last week!"" we. we. she said ""we"" as though she was from a&m. she is crazy. my boyfriend lives in college station and you will never find me there. there is nothing to do. so, he comes to austin. i realize i have pictures of people in my room that i do not even like. i only have a picture of this girl jenny because she is really good friends with my boyfriend. she and i are cordial to each other in person. we hate each other really though. i know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. i hate that she hates me because i am usually nice to her. but , i hate her too. but she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. so, i think i have the right to not like her. wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. i still have 8 minutes left and i feel like i need to do something else. maybe that means i have add. i cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time. its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. i am behind in all of my classes. i study and read-i just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause i don't catch everything. like i try to keep up, but i can't. its bad. i need to study more but then i stress myself out if i don't do anything but study. i need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. i stress myself when i study 24'7. that is how it was over the summer. everyone else went to frat parties every night and i stayed in and studied. there were no organizations to be in. there were only frat parties. and i don't even like frat parties all the time. drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. and plus boyfriends do not generally like that. so, i stayed in and studied. i was so focused on my grades that i would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85. because i was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, i stressed out so much that i threw up. it was really bad. all of my friends were really worried about me. i passed out and everything. over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. i guess i am just not good with my time management. i don't know. something is really messed up with me i think. my boyfriend thinks i could use a counselor. but if i see a counselor i probably will not have time for activities besides school. and that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. i like that i am doing them. i hope i make lassos. i am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. we shall see.

"i finally got all of my ethernet problems worked out today, so i e-mailed everyone i know. i wish my mom would call so i could tell her that not only did i get the package with my windows 95 disk but i also received my nabisco care package. it had all kinds of goodies in it but i haven't yet gotten to eat any of them yet. i wonder where scott is. i haven't heard from him since monday i think. he's probably at work, or playing magic with tim and anthony. i'm glad i got a card from julie today, looks like she's having a good time at ou. maybe i'll call her before i go to the red river shoot-out in dallas, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in dallas and i could stay with her. i wish the guys working outside would be quiet. and for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. my fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so i guess i'll live. i'm so excited! i get to go to my first ut football game on saturday. but i also get to go to all of the other home football games because i got season tickets. maybe i'll see my aggie friends at the a&m game november, kristine doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise i'd write her. i don't think i get to go home again until september the twentieth, but maybe i'll get to see scott then, unless he comes here, but i don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if i keep going back and forth i hope that i'm getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. i need to start planning my week like i learned how at the time management and study strategies seminar i went to on sunday i think i need to take a nap. i wish i had some nail polish remover, i need to repaint my toenails. i wonder if i can make it through three weeks before i need to get my nails redone. i hope so i don't want to change manicurists, i like vicky.

"i am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, i have mono. soon i will find out whether or not i have strep throat. in fact , i need to call the medical center hotline later, although i guess it really doesn't matter that much because i am already taking penicillin. last night i could not sleep at all i was in so much pain. i would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. but, then about an hour later i would wake up and wish i was dead, not literally, but i just wish the pain would go away. i can deal with feeling sick all the time because i know that will eventually go away. i have so much stuff i need to do still, but i never have the energy to do it. i miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, i guess that is part of growing up. texas plays rudgers this weekend here and i already have my tickets, i wonder what that whole day will be like. i also miss all of my friends from high school, but i got two letters 2 days ago. i always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. even when i was a little kid i would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. i was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and i argued all the time. but, now i seem to really miss them, i think because i am sick i miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when i was sick. i wonder how my brothers are doing, i haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. everything here at ut is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. the people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. i hope i can actually make good grades in my calculus class, which is really hard. i guess i need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. computers are really interesting. they seem like part of the ""system"" and red tape involved in everything. not that i don't appreciate or like technology, it just isn't personal at all. i need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why i think i miss my family, they were always there to talk to. i know i can graduate from college, but i sometimes wonder whether or not i really can. i also wonder about the many paths my life could take. will i be truly happy in the future? will somebody love me enough to marry me? will i ever find a person i want to marry. what job will i have, how much money will i make. will i be as successful as my dad? can i live up to all of the expectations of my family? sometimes i see answers to these questions, i don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination? i feel like time is passing and i am not really making an impact.

" i'm very worried about many things right now. i feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. i haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. i'm usually a guy that stays on top of things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like i'm not on top of things. i have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. i should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. i'm in houston right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. most of the time i was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. i find that houston is not as fun as it was. things are starting to change. my views and my emotions are quite different than before. i view my parents and my brother differently. i appreciate their company more than i did before. i guess i just miss them an awful lot. my brother and i are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in houston. i enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. i'm also kind of glad that i am going back to austin later today. i missed alot while i was gone. a friend's birthday party, ut's first football game, and a chinese bible study meeting that i was hoping to attend. i can gladly say that i don't regret comming to houston and being back home. i enjoyed it fairly well. suddenly, i feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. i'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that i should be doing, but i have a smile on my face. a sense of peace and a sense of sadness that i'm going to depart from this wonderful place i call home. both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. i can smell it from upstairs. i haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. university of texas is not what i had in mind. it is not as fun and exciting as i thought it would be. all my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. i guess things will get better as time progresses. i'm still not use to the freedom that i have and still not use to other things. i have also found out that i have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. i rather just be around those that i feel more comfortable around. the people at ut are nice thus far, i have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. i enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. i have learned that friendships are very important. since i use to move alot, from places to places, i have learned how to make friends and still be myself. i feel like i have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. i was very close to him and we were like brothers. now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. my friend has never dated before, but now is dating. he spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. i really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. i hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. college will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that i will never experience before. sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future nick chu.

" i'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because i attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59. very ironic. i feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. i have a lot to do and i don't feel like doing anything. i wish i could just go to sleep. i need a lot of attention from people these days and i'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and i'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe i'm just overreacting though, because i seem to do that so well. i don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and i smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. i have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5. i don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully i will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. i need to realize that i can make myself happy and i don't need someone else to make me happy. i don't even know why i'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head i suppose. i hope i get a new car. my dad said i can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. it will probably be something crappy like i have now. but i can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue i was starting to stress that i was going to get too far behind. i really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though i do try but i need more. i need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that i might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. i might stay at the appartment tonight but i probably won't because i have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens i suppose. i think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like i said i'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. i'm so tired right now i could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but i can't do that because i have entirely too much work to do. tonight i want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and i want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. i hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but i'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. i'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. i don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. i just hope it counts to him. oh well. i met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and i hope i get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. i'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san marcos and go see some people that i haven't seen in a long time. i hope i can scrounge up something to wear, because i need to do laundry and i need to go shopping, i have like no clothes anymore, i don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if i see her this weekend. i hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. i don't know what but i don't really like it. i'd rather just stay here and study or like watch tv then go home and feel awkward with my family. i have so much to do and i'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. i can already see that college is going to be very hectic. i hope i can handle it alright. wow the time is up.

"o. k, so now i'm writing for this assignment. i'm going to turn off the music i'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, i like new order. i like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. i'm probably more into that than most people i know. i wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night i ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. i totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and i crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and i hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was ""bamn"" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that i still live at home, i still live at home. i'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but i'd like to have my own place. but i don't have the money for that because i pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but i do feel good when i say that to other people, usually at work is when i do that. i work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. i got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that i could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. i keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a ""how are you"" exchange. things are going better with my parents and i. there was a time before ut,(i'm a transfer from acc)where i didn't really care much about things. probably because i wasn't being challenged, except from work which i enjoyed'enjoy. anyway, i was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob marley type stuff. i have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although i wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. i stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. i wish i was done now. funny because i was looking forward to doing this, but i thought it would be more of a stop'start thought process. it seems like i'm just narrating my last couple of days. i was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and i am somewhat. wish i had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, i have to write for an entire twenty minutes. i wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and ""treated"". i have avg acne, not really the worst i've had. i am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which i assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because i told her that i would clean it last night because i went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason i like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. i have a good view from the office room where i am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that i noticed that, i noticed i'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to gregory gym and how i can't really yet because i am a gimp. not really though, i could easily tough it out, i'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. i knew i'd miss high school for that reason. i like when i repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when i typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. i was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than i had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something i don't really want to do again, or do i? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished.

"i really can not wait until this weekend. ut is playing rice in football and i have some friends who play for rice. i have not seen these friends since this summer. i have only seen them on t. v. when they got killed my michigan last week. i hope that they play better this week. i feel bad saying it, but i kind of hope rice wins. i know it sounds terrible, but they are my friens & one of the players is my ex-boyfriend, but we are still good friends. i am most excited about seeing him. i talk to him on the phone occasinaly, but i have not seen him in person since july. we lived about 45 minutes away from each other and that made it kind of hard to see each other - that is why we broke up. the way we met was pretty cool. every year my home town (conroe) has a bbq cook off. let me tell you it is so much fun - i look forward to it each year. my dad has had a team in the cook off ever since i can remember. anyway, before the cook off last march a lot of my friends went over to my friends apartment. one of my friends who plays football for rice was coming down and he was bringing a lot of his friends with him. they all showed up at the apartment and we left for the cook off. my friends and i thought this one guy was so cute & he ended up driving my best friend and me to the cook off. i talked to him some that night, but then he and his friends all went back to houston. months went by and i graduated high school and for my senior trip we went to cancun. we had been there for a few days and one of my friends on the trip with me told me that he had just ran into ""the cute guy from the cook off"" down stairs. i couldn't believe it. he just happened to be in cancun at the same time as me & he was staying in the same hotel. we all ended up meeting and going out together & we had so much fun. ever since then we have talked and become really good friends. i guess that is why i am so excited about this weekend.

"i am so pissed right now because i was almost done and then my sweetmate's phone rang and i got disconnected and now i am just hoping that the phone doesn't ring again, i would like to get this done before the weekend begins. i am very excited about this weekend i think that it is going to be alot of fun. we are doing many things, let's see. tonight we are going to hillele first, which is a religious service (jewish). those are always nice,. hillel reminds me of camp which i love. i go to a religious overnight camp in wisconsin, ramah. in my last letter i was wondering if anyone is even reading this, maybe you are just checking that we did this and that's it. i mean, it has to be incredibly boring to read 500 of these. although, as a psychologist maybe it is totally interesting, you get to analyze all of us. those surveys well, i thought they were sort of pointless, just because as the teacher said (or you said if you are reading it), the research is meaningless if the patient knows what is being tested. it's not that i knew the hypothesis for all the surveys but they were pretty obvious and i could tell what the researchers were looking for. i like psychology so far though, i don't know if i am going to agree with everything though. i will have to see, but a friend of mine told me that it gets very logical and i am not the biggest supporter of logic. that must sound very stupid, well, that's not exactly what i mean, but i read this book, actually a short story, teddy by jd salinger, who i love and teddy said you have to look at the world without logic to understand things better. he said that when eve bit in the apple, she was really biting into logic. this seems very long, i have been writing for a while i also think i should stop because i am very nervous that the phone ",1,2.311974 -1.053105 -0.828105 -1.091534 -0.976142 0.643646 0.957288 -0.712703 0.538447 -1.200097 -0.054859 -0.590446 1.253665 0.235532 0.937808 0.0 -0.04277 -0.363505 -0.655682 1.020733 -0.41692 1.463284 -0.71068 0.093081 0.398778 0.494336 -0.671234 -0.541999 -0.293154 0.366973 0.906879 -0.777455 -0.809574 -0.114592 0.058232 -1.109326 1.425051 -0.534305 0.609193 0.346429 0.043284 0.559741 2.59172 2.337189 3.462091 1.989062 -1.093488 0.32276 2.272598 0.416315 -1.34699 -0.412986 1.401063 -0.361068 -0.489426 -2.194699 -2.123839 -0.954251 -0.091951 0.301697 -0.282821 -0.452321 2.087448 0.812451 0.227812 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.808525 1.65536 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.489119 3.016618 0.615821 -0.00946 4.919228 3.058456 4.414488 4.496568 5.373403,203
"i am feeling kind of nervous today because i only have one class and i am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. i also wonder why i have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges? in any event i know that i have to go over there and it will not be fun. i am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time i have physically seen them since i moved down here. also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit ut and i am excited that i will be able to see her. people told me that i would be overwhelmed when i came down here but i haven't felt that way yet. things are getting harder by the week, but i think i am handling it well. my room is a mess and i really need to clean it up and do the laundry. i guess i will today since i will have maybe a little free time.

"i don't know what i'm doing tonight. there's a cory morrow concert at the midnight rodeo place on ben white. i have no idea how i would get there. maybe i could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. i was just looking online and saw that some ou'ut tickets are going for like $2000. i don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. i just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the ou'ut game. pretty cool. ya, mike's getting upset at me cause i'm not going to college station this weekend. instead, i'm going to go see jerry jeff walker in gruene on saturday. god, i hate this nashville country thing. i got to change the radio station. it's upsetting. i wonder where my roomate houston is. he was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. oh well. i got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. i wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. i want to go play soccer tonight at clark field, but they're like watching american pie 2 tonight. that's really cool. oh well. haha, it's only been four minutes? this is going to take forever. i can't wait to go back to st. joe for homecoming. i want to go to the alumni party before the game. supposedly, it's pretty fun. they don't really mind at all if you're underage. haha. my leg is hurting because i'm pressing it up against the table while i write. what other homework do i have to do tonight? hm. . . oh, i have to print out some spanish worksheets. my computer keeps humming at odd intervals. i wonder what's going on there. i can't find a decent radio station that i can recieve in my dorm. i'm going to put some music from kazaa on. haha, just kidding. travis tritt- it's a great day to be alive just came on. haha. i hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because i'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. this song reminds me of garner state park. that was a blast. they have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. it's awesome. my buddies and i met all these cute girls from baytown, or something like that. all i know is that i want to go to baytown sometime! haha. my bed isn't too comfy. it could be a lot nicer. i need to fix that somehow. great, this song is ending. i wonder what's next. haha, a little kazaa is next. you ever listened to me and billy the kid by pat green? let me tell ya, it's a good song. i wish i could play the fiddle that well. i need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . that'd be cool. i suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. only halfway done. i wonder how much people write in these things. i bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. haha i held back with the darn right there. haha. anyways, i don't want to do calculus. the fiddle sounds really cool in this song. here's the solo. it soudns awesome. seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. you'll like it. . . if you're a texan. . haha. i hate antonian high school. my buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. we had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. we lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. you have no idea how upset we were. a freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. i'm still pissed about that, but oh well. this song is awesome. southbound 35 by pat green. it talks about coming back to texas when he's leaving in kansas. it's pretty cool. so what else. . i don't know how i'm getting to the ou game. i got to find a ride, maybe with amy. homework is no fun. haha. i love it when they mention austin in songs. it's pretty cool. i have to clean my room. i need to call whats that place. midnight rodeo and ask about the cover and when cory goes on stage. hope it's not much. college is quite expensive man. i love this part. ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. new song coming. . i feel like a little palo alto, naked sorority girls. the lyrics in that one are pretty funny. a sigma chi guy showed me this song during rush week. they're too expenisve. i think delta sig is the way to go. they're cool. this song has an awesome beat. haha almost done. this actually went by pretty fast. what to do after? maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. but when it comes to love, its all greek to me! haha. . . i love this song. well this has been fun. adios till next time.

"i am thinking about jason and wondering if we will get married. i am really happy but then there is tim, who wants to get in my calculus class and my teacher is an absolute freak. what is a freak anyway i don't know but i have heard that there are a lot of freaks here. my roommate is asking me what i am doing and i want to tell her that i am typing on my computer. can't she see that? some people are just redundant. this paper is redundant and life is redundant. people keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again, and they don't see the pattern. it took me a while to see the pattern of my redundancy but now i see the pattern and i still make the same mistakes. i always make mistakes and i do the same stuff and i didn't even make a sorority and i really don't really care. i can't type fast at all now i am stealing my roommates thoughts maybe i just am really dependent on other people and i can't even think for my self. hey sweetie? what's your name and major? i just heard my messages and they are not even my messages because i cannot think with my roommate complaining about how popular she is, i used to be popular i was so damn popular. and now i am just a number-my social security number gone is my identity and my boyfriend and my family and my roommate is trying to sleep and i am getting tired. i wonder what you would say, yeah you, if i told you that i slept through your psychology class and don't really care about what everyone has going on in their messed up heads. i am doing this because i have to, i have to do this and i have to be responsible. i can't believe that my father yelled at me today he is lying when he says he loves me. he told me that the only person he ever loved is mom and if i am rude to her once more then i will suffer. like what is he going to do? put me in a gas chamber or send me to jail worth no food? i can't believe this stuff is happening to me, at the party tonight i felt miserable. i hate jason for making me hurt so bad, i hate loving someone that is so far away. i hate the way i feel that i am missing out, but when i try to lead a normal college life i only wish i was at his house playing pool. i'm good at pool now. the holes on his pool table are smaller than average so that when i play on a real table i could really hustle somebody. hove i ever been hustled? what all can one be hustled in? i must be the victim of some huge pimp like hustle that follows me around and lets me fall on my ass when i feel good about myself, i hate you kevin hogan, i hate your lies and my lies to everyone about you, i would have made it somewhere had you never kissed me and hustled me. i wish that this computer would stop beeping, beep beep claire needs to sleep.

"i have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. my room mate is always playing spades on the internet. i type very loudly. my subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way i have it set up on my desk. this is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. the combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. it is like the drone of a prop-plane. my computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little ""engine"" noises while i am typing. my room mate has a very odd way of typing. as i am doing this assignment, i am hearing myself talk the words as i type. i am sure that i have always done this, however, until now i have not noticed it. i believe that i just heard thunder. we could use the rain. i can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. i have a knot in my stomach. i know that i did poorly on it. i have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. my monitor also makes a noise that sounds like i would imagine electical energy to sound. i want to go home this weekend. i miss my brother. i am going to bring him to austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of ut. what time is it? i wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet? i wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here? i would like to retreat to lake tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the sierra nevadas. that was a very random thought. all of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. if my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. i have never had a class quite like psychology 301. i like the fact that it is web based. if i happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. and even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. i wish that i would have attended the first study session. i wish that i hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. that is such a strange idiom. i wonder how it came about. i wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. i have a very nice printer. it's fast, silent, and very clean looking. i am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his deskjet! i had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. it has turned out to be my hardest class. i do not think that i am going to take any more spanish after this semester. i don't think that i was truly prepared to take spn312k, but i must have guessed well on the wisconson test. i hope that my friend cory does well at rutgers this weekend. i can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. it seems like just the other day when we were playing together for cunningham middle school. now the guy is 6'5"", 245lbs. ! i really enjoy football and i miss the contact, but my i'm experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. i really want to lift weights tonight, but i don't believe that i will have time. i also want to train with daniel, but i don't know what he has planned for tonight either. it feels like i have been thinking for hours, but it has only been a few minutes. this definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. at least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. and even then, that won't compare because ""artificial"" is in the name. i really hope that my timer goes off soon and i can stop writing. i think that it would be really cool if i could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. it would be like esp. that reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of esp in fifth grade gifted'talented class. it makes me feel good to say that i have been identified g't. that's very cocky sounding, but i don't believe that i have told anyone of my identification in years. i have a problem with cockyness. i had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion.

"well all i can think about at the moment is how stressful college is and why we have so much work to do. i don't understand it at all and i am very stressed out at the moment. highschool seemed so much easier but i know that it is something that i need to get used to. on top of it all i have so much sorority things to do. we have so many meetings and assignments to do on top of all of our school work. i just want to sit in my room and sleep because i am not feeling well. also i miss my parents. eventhough they are fifteen minutes away i am missing them but when i get around them they annoy me so bad. i don't understand it. i am difinately looking forward to our weekend because i know that our pledge retreat will be so much fun. especially becauase i cannot wait to get to know my pledge sisters. it will be awesome. i feel disconnected from so many of the girls and i know that they are feeling the same way. we seem to go out with the same people every weekend when there are fifty other girls that we still haven't really gotten the chance to meet. i really miss my friends from home a lot. especially jenna. but i know that she is having a blast at tech with kristi. the dorm is awfully quiet tonight. more so than usual. it is very weird not to hear people running up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs. it's actually very nice. i probably won't be able to sleep because i am so used to the noise. sleep also sounds really nice. i feel like i haven't done it in a year. now that i am sick i know that sleep is very important but who has time for sleep when there is a million other things to do in life. i also need to do laundry sometime in the next century before i run out of socks to wear. i think my mom said she was going to buy me some new socks this weekend but i never saw those. i wish it would just rain so then i would have an excuse to just sleep all day long. sleeping during a storm is so awesome. it feels so comforting. this is really weird just writing about random things. i feel like i am talking into a recorder or something or just having a really weird dream. actually i feel delirious just looking at all of the random thoughts that go through my mind. i feel like it's deep thoughts by jack handy. if you ever evaluate what you think about it funny to think that ""we always sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff. "" my dad loves that quote and he also reminds me of it. when i went to the doctor today he was writing down random quotes on the hospital bed paper about college and lecturing me about school. it was really annoying. oh well he was a very old man anyways. he told me never to forget those quotes and of course i already did. what does he expect of a busy girl like me. crazy people. well my time is up. i wish i could type faster so i would have more to say but this is it. random thoughts by kristen garcia.

"personally i feel really stressed out. i am a freshman at a very big university. i hardly know anybody and i feel very depressed and lonely all by myself. i am really close to my family so it is very hard to be eight hours away from them. i know this is a new experience, but i am just simply not happy here right now. many people tell me that i'll get used to it, but i wish the process of adjusting could be a lot faster. i feel as if i should just give up this great opportunity to be at a great university and just go back home. i don't want to let anybody down, for example my whole family. the pressure to do good in school and not give up is so intense. i want to do something with my life, but sometimes i just look for the easy way out. i didn't know that adjusting to college life would be so difficult. how am i supposed to keep up with all this work that is assigned to me. my time management and study skills have not kicked in yet. i miss my whole family back at home. all i can do is get stressed out, i need to find a way to just chill out. i'm worried about basically everything i can think of. i don't know if i'm going to pass my classes, can i manage much longer here by myself, and are people going to accept me for who i am. i'm just not ready for such a drastic change as this one. i have hardly any money left, and i have not even found a job yet. i really need some help to figure out what i am going to do. i really don't know what buses to take to get to certain places. i get really frustrated reading all sorts of maps. many times i feel as if i'm not even smart enough to be at a great university like this one. i think that is what my problem is, i just don't give myself enough credit. my brother tells me to think positive and he believes that i will make it here. i can not wait to go back home and see my whole family again. i wish i could be a senior with only one year to go. though that is not the case because i am a freshman, with many more years to go. then again what else better do i got to do than studying and working. i would simply waste time and my life doing nothing at all. i want to be successful in life and have a good paying job. i know that is the reason i am willing to study and work hard. knowing that when all this is done a job will be open to me. hopefully a good paying job to support all my dreams in life. i really do hope i can make it here at ut. right now as a freshman i really need all the hope and desire to help me get through this year. hopefully when this year is over i will be glad because i made it through all my classes. i know study groups would really help me right now. i really dislike reading, but i know i'll have to do a lot of reading as a college student.

"it's 11:18 at night. i'm tired, and i hate doing homework. i don't want to do homework. homework is evil. studying is evil. school is evil. all i want to do is be on the internet and surf, chat, and download. mp3s. you can never have enough mp3s. this ethernet is so fast! i love it. that's the only thing i like about college. the computer has made me antisocial. i don't need people, just need my computer. haven't really met and made many new friends. why? because i'm always in my room. because i'm always on the computer. i choose it over other things. things like studying. pikachu is lonely. he's sitting on my bed all by himself. just sits there. jester food is disgusting. i don't like it, but sometimes you have no choice but to eat it. nasty. kinsolving is better. eating in my room is good. i have better food in the closet. i mean, jester food isn't as horrible as it sounds, just that it's so fattening. just about anything on the main course menu has over 50% of the daily fat intake. that's way too much. worried about calculus. i hate math. got really bad teachers for math in high school, so now i'm paying the price. i wish i had better teachers. wish the room was colder. still got to study tonight before i can go to bed. got to study calculus. have a quiz on thursday. and a chemistry quiz too. it's so hot outside. i don't want to go out. adding on to antisocialness. it's better at night when it's cooler. i like it cooler. the internet is so fast. i think i will live on campus next year just for the ethernet access. sounds like a stupid reason. but it's reason enough for me to stay. i hate working out. it's hard work and i sweat. is the 20 minutes up yet? i don't think so, almost time. hahah. then i will be done with this evil homework assignment. i'm tired. i want to sleep. there's a stupid paperclip on my screen. i'm in word right now because my spelling sucks. and i don't care. the computer takes care of it for me. told you the computer is a great great friend. who needs real people when you have the computer? i've never eaten ants before. i don't think i want to eat insects. survivor was a good show. i tried to watch it every week. i liked summer. did nothing. i wish it was summer again. i got post it notes in the mail today. i am happy. stupid people complain to me about stupid things like hurting feet. food is good. school is evil. it's the devil! ok! yay! my time is up. good bye.

"i am sad. i just started thinking about the dog i left behind in katy, texas. that isn't exactly why i am sad though. it seems weird to me that i am really missing my dog and hardly ever thinking about my mom and dad. it isn't that i don't love my mom or dad but something must have gone wrong considering this is my first time away from them and i am hardly talking to them at all. if my mom sends me an email is usually says something like: nothing new here, mickey's now. mickey is my dog. i really feel like my dog is more important to my mom then i am. at least she has always spent more time with him. i am getting teary eyed which is weird because i haven't cried in years and i don't think i have anything to cry about now. my roommate's mom calls him every single night. i have talked to her more then i have talked to my mom since i have been here. i haven't heard a word from my dad at all. oddly enough i don't really miss my friends back home. we have been very close since sixth grade and i just left them. for some odd reason this really doesn't bother me. i can't stop thinking about how much your class stresses me out. it seems so easy. i know it won't be easy though, and that makes we question how much time i should be spending on it now. i almost had a panic attack when i saw that the website was down but it is now back up and that makes me feel okay. i am really hungry which is weird because i just ate a piece of ham, a piece of turkey, sweet potatoes, a piece of pecan pie, broccoli and cheese, and a neapolitan ice cream sandwich. isn't that nuts. hopkins 24'7 is now on. that is an awesome show. it really hits hard without showing gruesome er scenes (it is a documentary series). i lost my train of thought and i am now writing about nothing. well, my twenty minutes are up. bye.

"so here i am sitting at my computer. i am supposed to be doing my homework that i put off all week, i guess you could call this homework though. its a little cold in here, i haven't taken a shower yet. i hope my roommate doesn't just come home and i'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. i wish i could go home to see my family and friends. but i don't have the money. i hate my job. i wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe i'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. i'm hungry and my feet are cold. i wonder why it is that whenever i get hungry i get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever i get cold i get hungry. i don't think the second floor dining opens until 4:30, if even that, i can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. i really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since i dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time i get them, or were sent earlier in the day. i should really take a shower, i feel sticky. i think its from the ice cream. i just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day i might think about that, but today i've got bigger things to worry about. i like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which i think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. i would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. i wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. i mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday i was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than i did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so i said something, and it wasn't even mean, i just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. i couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, i hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. i think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. i know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. i couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time i get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did i buy two packs of gum? i went to wal-mart yesterday and for whatever reason i bought two packs of gum. i don't' even chew gum that often. maybe i bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, i think she was catching the 3pm bus out of san antonio. i'm going home next weekend. i'm supposed to catch a bus at 4 and get to dallas at 7:45. i guess we'll have to make some stops because i've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 3 hours. but i probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. i told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on friday, sat, or sundays because i didn't know when i was going out of town. and what did he do? schedule me for this friday. well i already bought the tickets and if i don't go home this weekend i'm going to go crazy. i miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. i miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. i got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. i don't talk to him anymore. i wonder if he even knows i'm here. samantha knows, i remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. i mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it i can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this? it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and i haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me? i don't know. well i should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening.

"i just got done watching ""first time felon"" staring omar epps. i was very moving. i'm cooking stew right now on the stove. i learned how to cook it from my father. he taught me how this summer. earlier today, i did this writing assignment and after completing it, i pressed clear instead of submit. that sure got me upset. anyway, i went to class today and the lecture was funny. the phone is ringing right now. the phone is still ringing. there, someone finally picked up the phone. i have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. and in two weeks i'll start having my first set of tests. they all fall on me at once. when i think about it, i don't want to study. but thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. i kind of enjoy it. it was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. i remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. that was a really nice view. i wonder how the stew is doing. hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. i see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. i really miss him. he was like a brother to me. we always looked out for each other. i'm really good friends with his brother too. he is a good church-going person. faithfully believes in god. well, i haven't talked to either of them for some time now. maybe i'll give him a call tomorrow if i have time. my girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. it was just a message. i really miss her. she is back in houston. her birthday is coming up on the 26th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. the problem is that i have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. i wish i could take the tests some other time. oh, well. that's life for you. my brother landed an internship with ibm, but hasn't started work yet. i wonder when he will start. his future looks bright for him. i can hear the t. v. downstairs. some cartoon show is playing right now. my roommates are downstairs watching it. i can see my keys from where i'm sitting. they are attached to the pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. actually i have two key chains. the other one is of jesus. a total stranger gave it to me one day and i've never seen him since. i like to think that it was jesus himself, giving me strength when i needed it the most last year. i was feeling down and out last year. i was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. he walks up to me and gives me the key chain. he tells me that jesus will never turn his back on me. so every time i look at the key chain, i think of him and it gives me strength. school is finally underway now. i hope that i do good this year. anyway, the 20 mins are up. hopefully i'm doing this right. i know that this isn't even for a grade, but i just worry a lot. speaking about worrying, i'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because i've been calling back to houston everyday.

"i simply don't know where to start. having a timer count down how long i have to type is kind of stressful for me. i feel like i have to rush to write enough for twenty minutes. but then, how would the teacher know if i really did type the whole twenty minutes? what if i was a naturally slow typer? however, i am a good typer, so i will have plenty of stuff to write. i just got back from my chemistry class, and we learned nothing new. i am surprised at how well i seem to be understanding everything in that class, considering the fact that my high school chemistry teacher was a nutcase. i am like my current chemistry teacher because she teaches things in a nice, normal way, unlike my previous teacher. i learned about the basics more today, like density and specific gravity and all the other good chemistry stuff. on the way back home, however, i learned that my flip flops were not the best type of shoes to walk a long time in because they gave me blisters on the tops of my feet. the plastic that goes into the foamy part of the shoe made a sharp angle and kept rubbing into my skin until it was raw. i am now in pain because i was not very careful when choosing the type of shoe to wear to class. today was the first day since i arrived in austin that i have worn shorts. i finally gave in and accepted the fact that it's just too hot here to keep wearing jeans all the time. i felt like i was being a slob because i wore a big t shirt and cotton shorts. i felt like i should be going to the gym instead of chemistry. when i got back home, i saw some people sunbathing in the pool. i wonder why anyone would want to sunbathe now when it is already so hot and sunny all the other days of the week. how odd. i'm relieved that it is friday--the end of the week. i can now relax and enjoy myself with my friends. today was also a good day because i finally got internet service, which is why i chose to do my assignment today. i find myself not capitalizing any of my letters that should be capitalized because on aol instant messenger, i don't need to punctuate or capitalize very well or accurately. my sister just got a call from a friend, and i am wondering who is calling. i really want to know but i can't ask her because she is still talking. from hearing her talk, i think the caller is one of our friends who is in her philosophy class. i am feeling a little hungry right now becuase i ate lunch at noon, and it's been a while since i fed myself. i had a few cheese nips before i started, but i regret leaving them in the kitchen because now i can't eat as i type. oh well, that's ok because if i did eat while i did this assignment, the keyboard would get all oily and i would not be very pleased with myself. i guess i should eat after finishing this assignment. i see that still have seven minutes to go, so what am i thinking right now? i still feel the pain in my foot from my stupid shoes. i am also excited because i get to hang out with my friends this evening. i might see a movie. speaking of movies, i am planning on seeing the robin williams movie one hour photo next week with my friends. i am excited because robing williams is a good actor, and i enjoy most of his movies. i am kind of apprehensive because it is supposed to be a thriller or scary movie. i hear my printer printing my sister's assignment, and i'm getting annoyed at it because it's so loud. i am wondering why i bought this printer, knowing that it was loud. in the consumer reports, it said that the printer was good, but loud, but i bought it anyway because it was cheaper than the one that i was looking at. maybe i shouldn't have gone the cheap way. oh well, it's a little late now. what should i eat for dinner? i want to eat out, instead of cooking for myself because i am lazy and i don't want to make something. i want someone else to do the dirty work and me to enjoy the results. i can't wait until dinnertime, but i can't eat anymore because i have eaten too much already. i am kind of tired today because i had to wake up early to wait for the cable guy. i think i will take a break after this assignment and sleep a little. that would be nice because then i will be refreshed this evening. yesterday, i couldn't sleep, but i don't know why that was. it might have been the outside noise from people coming and going from the parties around here. i hate the inconsiderate people who don't think about how their noise affects others.

" i am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, i'm still going to think as i write this intro. you see, it's my birthday today, and so i could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. i'm taking a girl i like to a party tonight - i guess that might be more interesting. or maybe i should just talk about how my parents really piss me off. since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. but before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. they would bitch about anything, seriously. i mean, i had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. my friend jackson once told me i should get in a lot of trouble. then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. for some reason i never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. but, he was right. when they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year. okay, new topic. when i was over at my friend alex's house one day, this kid pulls out alex's . 22 rifle. i'm like, dude, don't point that at me, turn it away. he listens, and he starts pointing it at alex. alex is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. this kid is pointing the rifle at alex, making shooting noises, while alex is playing a nintendo game. for some reason, i had a really bad feeling. this was not a toy - it was a gun. pop! all of a sudden it went off. the thing was, the kid was at such close range, alex couldn't even feel the blast. i had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. i ran to call the ambulance, and i think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), i've never liked guns. my phone's ringing right now, but i'm not going to pick it up since i'm doing this assignment. you know, i bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. that's so boring. i like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. i'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. but thanks for listening and i'll catch you on the flip side.

"realizing that i am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. everyday, i open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and i have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. i have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now i posses all these things. and as excited as i am, i also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. not in myself or my actions but in all i have left behind. yes i am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but i am also talking about my childhood and innocence. ok, go with me for a little bit--- i know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. i am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. i don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. my teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. all those thing that i took for granted but were a daily part of my life. don't get me wrong, i love the freedom of college and the fact that i can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call my mom if i happen to skip class. i really don't know where i'm going with this, all i can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. it's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. i am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so i don't oversleep. yet, i should confess that so far, i am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. one thing i certainly enjoy is the fact that i can spend more time with my friends and i can go out on weekdays and i can eat unhealthy food as much as i want. not to say that i indulge myself in such activities constantly. i guess the point of it all, is that i am confused. i am trying to find out who i am. and i think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, i think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.

" the room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. i should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so i will go to a study group. i'm kind of hungry, i don't know what i should get for dinner today. should i go for sushi or pasta, why am i so indecisive? i wonder what my friends are doing right now. i hate it when i don't know what to write, or when i have a blank moment. i should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. what is it that makes people tick? as soon as i find the time to, i'm going to read lord of the rings. maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. there goes my indecisiveness again. i wonder which song i should listen to next, what am i in the mood for. this song sounds good, i guess i'll stick with this one for a while until i get bored of it. is there any other homework left, i hate it whenever i get the feeling that i'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. it might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. maybe i should call my study partner that i might be late in coming because of thi essay. i'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on tv. i wonder if the music that i'm playing bugs my roommate or not. the tv show thats on right now seems pretty funny. i've never had mountain dew: code red before, maybe i should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. what is the point of life? all we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. i wonder what it would be like if i could be immortal. many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, i on the other hand find it interesting. i hope i can get a high gpa and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way i wanted it to. i still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could i be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. oh well i can make it up on the next homework. i better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since i've done it all already.

"i think about my mother, my ex-boyfriend in houston(of whom i'm still in love with) and just things that are going on in my life right now. all of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming. and for some reason during all of this i listen to the most depressing tori amos or sarah mclachlan song. after a good cry i always feel better, i think it's healthy to cry though. i think it's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy. dealing with things, for me, is the best way to get over them. but sometimes i tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out. i seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when i would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me. my parents got divorced at that time, about when i was 11 years old or so. i remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because i missed her. she and i have one of the best relationships i've ever seen between parent and child. she is my friend not just my mother. but i don't cross boundaries, i respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance. i think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit, use it to their advantage, i just respect it and cherish it with all my heart. i quote sarah mclachlan, ""and i have the sense, to recognize, that i don't know how to let you go. "" i think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year. we've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other's lives at some point or another. i guess it's a good thing, he's a wonderful person and a great person for me. but i just don't know if i can do this (be in love with him have a relationship, what have you) with him being in houston and me here in austin. i don't know if i want him calling me telling me how much he misses me, and telling me he loves me when he's two hours away. i guess it's not that much of a distance compared to other people's long distance relationships, but i think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those. i certainly know they're not for me. and from his past experiences with them, all bad, i know he's not too keen on the idea either. i miss him terribly, touching him, smelling him, his humor, his voice, everything. e-mail and phone conversations don't suffice. i just got a new laptop and i wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and i hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing. ugh! i hate this thing, but i really don't i like having it to take to the library. i just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do. i'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things. they just don't interest me that much. i'm much more of a trial and error person. except when it comes to math basically because i don't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out. i want a formula there for in my face. we're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now. it's a total bitch. i made three really cool friends in that class. one of my friends tim i saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together. i wish he were cuter, he's a really nice guy. and i made these two other friends tracie(same name as my best friend) and stephanie. they're both really cute, and tracie seems like she'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with. she was telling me about her cousin's friend who's gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion. imagine that. but i would love to go to new york. especially after seeing that movie a perfect murder , i mean i know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on central park but i would love to just go visit it. i love the whole image of it, it's just very chic for some reason. i would live there if i could get a very high paying position somewhere, but that's the only way i would. it's just too crowded otherwise.

"right now i feel somewhat tired and weak because of work last night. i'm also feeling a little upset because the eagles destroyed the cowboys 4114 to. and to top it off we lost joey galloway, our best receiver. also troy aikman had another concussion and who knows what will happen next. but on a more serious note i'm a little worried about college. i guess i feel like i have a lot of weight on my shoulders, because i want to prove to my family and to myself that i can make it. school has always come pretty easy to me, but this is college and it worries me. i think once i get the first test out of the way i will be fine. at least i hope i will be fine! i'm also having mixed feelings because i quit my job in order to have ample time for college. things just weren't mixing right so i had i discussed it with my family we decided it was best for me to hold out on working until i got in the grind of college. life has been pretty good lately it's hard to get a schedule with so many things going on. each day is a whole new adventure. some troubles i ran into with college so far were finding a parking place and having to walk ten minutes to my classes. one good thing that has happened though is i have really good classes and professors. i also have people looking out for me and i have made some new friends. ut is like a whole new country there are so many people, places, and things to do. i'm beginning to understand college life. when i first applied to ut i had no idea that it would be like this. i never expected it to be so big and beautiful. everywhere you walk there is something new to see. every building is huge and has something that sets it apart from the others. i guess ut is blown out of proportion with me because i come from a small town of 5000 people. it was a city where the most popular people won everything. but here at ut it doesn't matter who you are. it's like everybody starts over. everybody is giving a clean slate. it's a great chance to prove myself to the people around me, my family, and me.

"the clock is ticking and i have to wake up at 8 o clock tomorrow. lots of white space on the wall and on the screen, purple hat on the side, people walking in the stairs red trees falling off the building. it is difficult to speak continuously, perhaps there should be pauses in between words but then there would be no coherency but then there is no fluctuation in tone and all the mechanics of rules and boundaries rendering the sentences more honest than not. difficult to type without thinking, every once in a while something pops into my head but prolonged thought disrupts the image and i forget what to say, and the thought of forgetting makes me think more about it, disrupting it further and pushing any sense of coherency into the deepest of abysses. hunger stirs in my stomach, quiet thoughts in my head about simple things, nostalgia, reminiscing all things past, good and bad, because there can be no good without the bad, the contrast makes all the difference. peter parker was an extraoridinary young man as a result of his radioactive bite, i fail to have any of his special abilities, lacking in the radioactive bites. does this make me less extraoridinary? or perhaps i am something of a special person, considering all the different things that happen. comic book heroes have nothing to do but save and do superpowers and shoot bad guys but in the realm of the real world i am an exemplary everyman with no superpowers making me different than peter parker. my computer is overloaded or maybe my mind is going crazy, but this has been an inordinate amount of time. 7 minutes into the assignment, it is difficult to type without stopping the train of thought im currently in. all i can think about at the moment is how different this assignment is compared to anything i have ever done for any class. flowing and ebbing out of my mind like a loose river flooding the dam, breaking the barrier and drowning out rationality. confusion and mayhem and all things in my head in disarray, unquestionably noisy because of my roommate, undeniably hot because of centralized air conditioning. tired of typing, concerned about the method of writing , and if my stream of consciousncess is anything like the professor expects. should words be spelled correctly? maybe i should stop correcting typos and keep typing the letters on the keyboard. people are talking to me but i have managed to tune them out, a song is playing somewhere in the distance, or maybe it is right next to me. at this point it makes no difference. i am confused still, a bit baffled, left in stupor. finding the words to describe anything is tough. i visited home over the weekend and realized i didn't miss it too much. i appreciate my family and love them but the thought of a monthly visit home makes me cringe slightly. the blue cable running from my laptop to the resnet connection is coiled up tight yet loose, symbolic of my thoughts. it looks like its organized, but upon closer inspection there is nothing but chaos. few sockets not plugged in, one surge protector shared with my friend. i don't know what else to say. i have some worries about my future, whether or not i chose the right college, and especially whether or not i will have the courage to switch majors if i realize i am in the wrong one. the finish button stares me in the face, tempting me to hit it before the timer hits 20 minutes. 6 to go, i find that i don't really have a stream of consciousness, instead i have very few thoughts, or perhaps they are buried underneath the noise and nonsense i find myself having to sift through right now. occasionally pausing, because the only word i can think of would be a jumble of letters ars opposed to words that make sense. if everyone is having trouble writing this then im okay, but if i ask my friend tomorrow how she handled this and she says it was fun i will be in trouble. this is incredibly hard. am i tracking my feelings or am i tracking observations? what is the difference? philosophy in a 20 minutes stream of consciousness, unabashed, the sentences stopped making sense long ago. 4 minutes give or take. pennebaker is a professor of psychology, enrolled in psy301 i do not know what i should do with 3 minutes of typing. i type faster than i talk. i talk and often my thoughts move faster than my mouth, so that the sounds coming out of my mouth are made up portmanteau words, assemblages like fooding, eated, noteady, meaningless in the end. personally i think that soft drinks taste good, but i can feel them eroding my teeth with intensified sugar collecting around the teeth. science or engineering? i prefer to do the maths because my memory is not so good. business or engineering? i am indecisive, hunger in the belly, thirsty all over. shower and swim, run and jog. nothing to study but people seem to be studying frequently. calculus is different than algebra. too many courses in this college. they should combine them all into one super course.

"i am thinking right now, at this momest what cullen is thinking. does he like me?? i wonder. i wonder if i am too short. i wonder if i am too fat. i wonder if my mom is ok. she is always worrying about me and she thinks so highly of me. i don't want to let her down. my dad works so hard for the entire family. i sometimes think he looks so sad. i hope he isn't sad because o love him more than anything. i wonder if i will find true love? someone just like my father. a strong, hardwroking, loving man who would do anything for his wife and kids. i am very annoyed right now at the sound of the vaccum. i feel sorry for the woman who is vaccuming. i hope she can not read this as she is standing behind me. i am very excited about the party tonight. i hope i can balance work play. i think i will be able to. i have never had a problem before. all the girls here are very nice. i was really scared to come here because i thought all girls that went here were snobs. but they are nice. i have matured greatly since i have been here. i can't believe i have a cclass at 3:30. that is such a nightmare. i would rather just get them all over with at once. i hope i picked the right sorority. i am glad i am not in kappa with katie. but then i wonder if i should be a kappa. i think i just look more like a kappa then a theta. oh well. i will be happy. our pledge class is awesome. i am so excited about this scrapbbok we have to make. it is so fun. i love being like a martha stewart. is it bad that i just want to go to school to find a husband and j\have my 5 kids???? i hope i really don't have to work. it scares me. everything was perfect before i left. now everything scares me because i am facing reality. i am living with a person i don't even know - to go to school here. i hope the future brings awesome things for me. i am worried because everyone says that there is a time in your life that will be grief. i have had the best life so far. i am scared that one day it will just hit m - poof - and i will just want to die. i hope my mom or my dad or my brothers don't die soon. i love them too much. i never show them that i do though. i probably have the worst relationship with my motehr, ever. we barely speak. i just go to her if i want money. i think that that is because she sees me as the most perfect creation, ever. so she never has yelled at me, or scolded me. but she yells at my brothers all the time. that is so unfair to them. i should not be treated better. my brothers are all dyslexic, including me, but that is not my e\excuse. it is my brothers excuse for everthing. my mom is always doing luke's papers or assignments for him. that is so wrong. i work hard and study more because i am dyslexic. i deal with it. my brothers see it as a means to get out of doing work. the assume they are dumb, so they don't even try. they are satisfied with being dumb. that should not be the case. i really miss bridget. she is my very best friend. i also miss katey. my two best friends at tech. i think it is great how i did not follow them. i am a very dependent person, yet independent. i depend on my friends, yet i love to be alone to ponder and be by myself. katey and bridget are like my securities. evn if i did notr have one friend here, i knew they, at leats bridget, will alwyas be there for me. i hope tonigth is fun. i feel really sorry for my suitemate. she tries so hard to meet boys but they just don't like her. she has had sex a lot. i am very pround of my virginity. i think it says a lot abput who i am and how important god and my morals are. i love the fact that i can just talk to god anytime - anywhere by myself. he knows all about me - and i know all about him yet i have never seen him nor spoken to him. a true person is found in the dark. if you were to turn off all the lights everyone would probably like a totally different person they who they think they should like. it wouldn't matter is you were tall, small, fat, ugly, black or white, if the light were off. only the insides of people would matter. appearances say a lot aboiut people, but yet they don't. if a person was ugly, you probably wouldn't really care what they thought. because we are all attrcated to people. our frieds are people we think are attractive and so we only like people in which we think there is something pretty about them. well, my twenty minutes are up so i guess i have nothing more to say.

"i really wanted to get that done before i went home this weekend, but i guess i will just have to try later. i am also feeling pretty excited though right now because i just finished talking to this guy that i met on saturday night and we are supposed to get together tomorrow night. i'm excited but i'm also nervous. i'm not really sure if i like this guy or not. the actual truth is i'm not really sure if i find him attractive. when we hooked up that night we were both under the influence of alcohol, but we weren't really drunk. my friend tells me that he's cute but i just have to take another look for myself. that's kind of mean for me to say but i don't want to be going out with an ugly guy. i feel like gods going to punish me or something for saying this but i'm sure everyone wants to be with someone that they are attractive to. this guy is really cool though. he's a theater major or a plan 2 major. i guess his minor is theater but anyway. he's a really funny guy. we get along really well. it's odd though because the couple of times that i have talked to him i don't even feel nervous which is odd because i usually feel nervous when i'm talking to a guy for the first time. i guess this should tell me something, that he's a pretty good match for me. we just joke around like crazy and just play off of one another's comments. it's pretty awesome. i'm kind of stuck now i really don't know what to write but now something just came into mind. before i was talking to this guy i talked to my friend from back home. she's getting married in october and i'm going to be her maid of honor. hearing her talk about the wedding plans just freaks me out. i just can't believe. it makes me kind of sad though like as if i'm losing her to her future husband. it's not going to be the same anymore, i just can't go over to her house anymore and just chill out since she's not going to be living there anymore. to top everything out she's pregnant which is really the reason they are getting married but they really do love one another so they'll be happy. the day she found out she was pregnant was very freaky. i was there with her at her home when she took the home pregnancy test. she came into her room screaming oh my god jennifer it's already turning pink after only a few seconds. i saw the line appear which lets you know that you are indeed pregnant. i was in complete utter shock. i was almost in tears. once we started talking about it and how cute it's going to be i would just want to cry more. it's just weird i guess having one of your best friends get married and have a baby when we're so young. i can't wait though for her to have it so i can see it and play with the baby. even today at the mall i went into gap kids and looked at baby outfits. i want to buy her some really cute outfits for the baby. the baby isn't due until april sometime but it's never to early to start looking. i'm stuck again and this time i think it's for good. come on you can think of something. ok this is to weird i'm writing to myself on the computer telling myself to think of something. i'm almost done i have one more minute. i'm actually freaked that i actually got done with this before sept 11 when it's due. i always wait for the last minute but i'm starting the year off good and doing thing ahead of time. i feel relief now that i'm done. yeahh.

" for the past two weeks, i've been down here in austin, tx, home of the largest university in the nation, and while i thought that i would have the time of my life, i cannot seem to move past the feeling that i am completely alone in a world of 50,000 students. i had wanted to come to this university for five years, but now that i'm here, im constantly thinking of ways to either get out or somehow to get used to it. the fact is, i left my friends. although this is something that everyone going to college is faced with, the friends i left were the only ones that i had kept for more than 4 years since my family moved around often. and this time, leaving them was actually my decision! i continually tell myself to just give it time and i will find my place. however, as i struggle being in a new city by myself, it seems that everyone that i talk to is having the time of their lives: the time that i wanted and expected to have upon arrival in austin. wanting to transfer closer to where my friends are occuppies much of my thoughts each and every day. i just can't move past it. it's as if the world is moving on without me. i feel as if i'm lost, and i don't know how to find myself again. either i stay here and attempt to find the dream i had expected, or i find a way out of the city. everyone seems so happy. why can't i be like them? i miss everything about my home, but most of all i miss how familiar everything was. i knew what was going to happen every day, and here, i don't know what to do with myself! anyway, i really wish my roommate would come home every now and then! i hardly see her. i miss my boyfriend so much! i sound like such a typical teenage girl in saying that, but it's true. i miss my life before college. i hadn't realized how happy and lucky i truly was to have such amazing friends and family close by all the time. perhaps i just need to get out there and truly find someone to talk to, but it feels like i've tried that already. i wish so much that i could just meet someone and right away have a friend! it's ridiculous to think that way, but honestly, the world would be a much friendlier place! okay, so now it seems like i'm just rambling on. i should go running sometime soon, but it's extremely hot outside!! i cannot wait for this weekend because i have a ride home. see, i continually come back to this topic. i desperately hope that i maintain the same relationship with my friends. i feel so stressed out lately. i don't know what to expect yet from college, and calculus is absolutely killing me! if i don't get an extremely high gpa, i might have to transfer universities in order to get accepted into business. why couldn't my life have just stood still during my senior year of high school? i loved it, only i didn't know that i had the life i always wanted until i was forced to leave it and start over. i sound as if my life is falling apart, and it's not. sometimes i just feel too overwhelmed with making new friends and meeting new people, keeping in touch with everyone and wishing they were here with me, and then there's the little fact that i'm supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my life at some point soon! business is just so general, so i thought it would be a great starting point. who knows? definitely not me. i'm so confused right now. people are outside running right now. i should get out there and attempt to keep in shape.

" write now i'm very tired i just got home from austin. i haven't been getting much sleep lately so i have really been dragging. i'm fixing to eat dinner with my family. i have alot of homework to do tonight including some calculus which is very frustrating. my house is very quiet the only sound in it seems to be me striking on these keys. this is an unusal assignment i have never done anything like this in the past. so far i am enjoying school at ut it is my first semester and although it is all a little overwhelming i think things are going to work out. i have to comute back and forth everyday that is the only thing that seems to be gettiong old. i went to the ut football game on saturday i had a great time but, wished that we would have played better in the second half. i love sports i have played them since i was five. i fact this is probaly the first time in my life where i havn't been playing sports. now the noise in my house starts to raise a little as my brother gets home from tennis practice. he is a good kid i'm glad that he is doing so good in school right now. he tries really hard, and takes things really seriously. i smell my mom making diner. she works in austin as well and has to commmute just like i do. my mind is drawing a blank now, i'm so tired it's hard to concentrate. i guess i am a little worried about school, i have to make really good grades this semester because i'm trying to transfer into the business school. i have put alot of pressure on myself to do good in school. i get stressed out when i don't understand some of the material in one of my classes. calculus worries me the most. i have never been that good at math. i'm struggling right now just going through the review. i try really hard in all my classes but i'm worried that won't be good enoegh. oh well all i can do is my best. my house has grown quiet again much like it usually is. now i hear my phone ringing but nobody seems to be answering it. i'm looking forward to a warm bed to sleep in tonight. i have to wake up early to go to work though. i enjoy work at least it breaks up the monotony of being in school all day. well my time was just up so.

"today is only the sixth official day of class, and i am already stressed out. i know that i don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but i feel just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. i wish i was already set into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. i get nervous every time i think of what possibly lies ahead. i also have to start looking for a job. i feel i do not have the time to work, but i believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if i have set things to do. i guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. i mean 5-10 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job i could find. i can look in to this of friday considering i only have one class, although i seriously think i should take an extra hour or two to simply lay down and rest. i haven't done that in a while. what else do i have to do on friday? look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and whatever else comes up. let's see, saturday. the game is on saturday, so i guess i will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. at least i will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. so far, i guess i like it here. i mean i am having fun and enjoying myself but i just got use to doing nothing during the summer. no reading, no calculus, no tennis, no stu. -co. or nhs meetings. not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. yet, i do miss tennis. even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it was always a blast. i miss the team especially, and all my close friends. i am the only one of my closest friends that came to ut, but i guess it is all working out fine. if i went with them to college, i would be at a&m. naah, i'm ok here. i can always call them. i miss home. i knew that i would be homesick. even though i like being here, i sometimes wish i was still at home, in my house, with mom, dad, and even lori & angie. gosh, i never thought i would miss those two brats this much. oh, i miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. i need to call her tomorrow. it's already to late. i wonder what they are all doing right now. they are all probably asleep. i'm hungry, actually just thirsty. i could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. i can't wait for this weekend. hopefully i will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 10:30 am. going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. my legs are so sore from all the walking i have to do every day. i'm used to jogging and walking at least 3 miles most days, but walking here is exhausting. uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. just thinking about it makes me tired. i need to get everything i need ready for tomorrow, but i think i am just going to lie down and watch tv till i fall asleep. i am so tired.

"my mind is fried from the test that i just took. did i do well? did i screw up?. did i get tickets to the football game. jeff was supposed to have a friend draw. i hope our seats are good, because today has been a rough day. i hope jeff likes me. this writing assignment makes me feel really funny because of all my sporadic thoughts. i wonder if this is one of the papers you decide to read, or if it is just going to end up in some data bank somewhere. i hope psychology is going to be a semi easy course because college at this point is a little overwhelming. my roommate just walked in, so i guess i should mention her. allison or ally, whatever i feel like calling her at the time. she fun, makes me laugh, i could use that right now. the test was easy but what if i just screwed up on it because it was my first test. i guess i will know by today what the event will be. the pressure to make good grades is getting to me. i want to have fun and do a little bit of everything, but i don't know how to fit it all in. i want to party with my friends, but i also want to do well. how far will that get me in life. what if i bust my butt and nothing happens. i'm beginning to notice a pattern in my thoughts; they are all questions. does that mean i'm missing the answers, or does that mean i worry too much. here i go with the questioning again. i'm trying not to be clich'd and do the average, i wonder if so and so likes me, but it is ending up like that. all of my life is in a state of not knowing. for everything that i have learned, it seems like there is much more because everything that i know doesn't answer all of my questions. that's where i get my nosiness, i guess. i classify myself as an ambulance chaser. the time is flying a lot faster than i thought. scooby doo is on tv, that is kaitlyn's favorite show. she's at home in dallas. i miss her so much and that reminds me that zach's surgery is going to be tomorrow. he's so little, will he be ok. more questions. they are driving me nuts (feel sorry for the reader). here's the issue of time again. i'm running out of it, literally and figuratively. i guess its nap time, i don't even know if i want to do that for sure.

"okay so now i am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing. i wonder why i have to type that out what am i thinking of course this is what i am going to write this music that i am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer i feel very stressed out writing to a real timer i don't know why i think i will take off my head phones i had planned to write about a lot but for some reason i can't seem to do more than write what my head is thinking about for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did i guess i can start by describing my environment lets see the air smells like air the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window right now there isn't any noises and i feel somewhat stressed and anxious the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not i actually have a though or not and i think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed i can't believe i have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like i have to help him but i fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me i just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart as if i feared that i am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly i can't believe i have already written for 5 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what i am doing, like i cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which i was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here i am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and i wonder if i am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense i really hope it does because if it doesn't well i guess my mind is simply disorganized but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, i really think i cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do i actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything i've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? i have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather i can hear it, its a strange process i guess i really can't multitask when i am writing a stream of consciousness i see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered perhaps i am not truly tracking my own mind i must dwell further in. i'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something i didn't know existed i remember my childhood i don't know why but for some reason i start remembering it whenever i think too hard that or i am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should i go pick it up? maybe i will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like i had to pick it up for a bit, i hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 20 seconds of non thought but i can make up for it because it was my friend who i needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though i dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here i am fixing mistakes in my typing maybe i should just leave my mistakes in so i can listen to myself more. right well now i feel nostalgic or actually no i don't i just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and i was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if i were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. i miss my childhood and here i am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. i would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but i guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about it, yeah i make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually i have written so much originally i had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but i guess that was yesterday night when i was heated up about it today i just feel complacent about writing about nothing. i see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now i feel disappointed why am i disappointed? i guess i just thought i could find something that could prove that i am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that i write even regular to all people? i don't know but i like being special. well no. now i feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 3 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, i can't really plan ahead, i can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away i guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and i don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps i forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am i so eager to put interest in this bit, i do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what i just said god. now i am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if i tried to organize it i would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that i think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes i end up saying nothing because i dunno i know i obviously have a stream now but i guess since none of it makes much sense i can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps i am just afraid that if i do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 8 more seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. bye ",0,0.414666 -0.854405 -0.263844 -1.207012 -1.015613 -1.29149 0.836173 -0.187451 0.176271 2.385862 0.235626 2.887421 -1.985609 -0.020663 1.100227 0.0 -0.04277 0.363882 0.74429 -0.176506 0.737753 -0.261258 -1.208639 0.927263 -0.066288 -0.017123 0.521754 -0.126321 -1.594158 -1.774108 -0.735396 -1.074563 -0.452803 1.036091 -0.577812 -0.524659 1.740009 1.051036 1.898717 0.083134 -0.153671 1.78237 -1.176132 0.830946 -0.262514 0.658372 0.965772 -1.085041 0.524398 -1.225678 -0.824564 -0.540968 -0.253425 0.613645 -0.930005 -0.48111 -0.305272 0.364894 -0.413927 0.757836 -1.036287 -0.504774 0.219917 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.741759 -0.503741 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.537437 -0.37208 -0.225806 -0.422267 -0.5664 0.021266 -0.269091 -1.618848 4.236859 4.309245 4.45674 4.86054 4.801289,2030
" right now i am sitting here. the washing machine is very loud. my nose is really stuffy. i really like that band brandston that i saw the othernight. they were really nice and really cool. i can't wait until i get to hang out with steven. i really missed him while i was in austin. stupid nose itches. i don't understand why randi and i seem to not be as close anymore. its kind of sad. she has been my best friend for 5 years. its really ironic that steven is now my best friend. who would have ever thought? ""don't come crying back to me. when you're lonely and all out of love"" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific song. its a very nice song. very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting. i can't believe that i still have 17 minutes left to type. its usually very hard for me to type stream of consciousnes, i've tried it before in a humanities class for some reason. i can't ever seem to really put what i'm thinking on paper. that's why its hard for me to write or keep a journal. i even lie to myself on paper. i wonder why. i also wonder why mikey is the way he is with me. i can't believe i ran into him last night. he completely ignored me. that really hurts my feelings because we were really close. at least i thought so. i really need closure. i hate myself for not hating him. my nose is running again now. it's getting in the way of my typing. i am so stressed out right now about biology. the house is completely silent right now except for the washing machine. the dorm is never this quiet. i think maybe that's why i like the dorm. because its loud. ow, i just hit my ear that i just pierced. its really sore. the pain only lasts for a split second though. its not as hot here in amarillo as it is in austin. the weather here for labor day is perfect. i think i will go and walk my dogs. i just sneezed again. i am sick of sneezing. stupid allergies. i need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework. i also need to read chapters 3 and 4 for psychology. i am behind. i am so worried about my biology. i don't understand it and because of that i am not focusing as hard on my other classes. however, government should be easy. i've taken that class before. psychology is fun, but i really do not know what to expect on my tests. i don't know how i will do in that class. i thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy at all. someone is getting ice from the refrigerator. i can hear it. wow, does my mind really jump this much? that's really interesting. i guess i am sort of truly typing in a stream of consciencous. am i even spelling that right? i usually can spell. i feel like everyone else at ut is smarter than i am. i am not used to that. i'm always the smartest. no one here knows my reputation. no one knows that i am smart. but maybe i'm not smart. maybe i am just lucky. my little puppy shinobi isn't eating anymore. maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday. i really missed my dogs. zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me. he licked me all over. i love dogs so much. but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people. other dogs like me more. just my luck. i had to explain what i am doing to my mom. this is all interesting. the fan is on now. my legs are cold. i think i'm sick. i want to listen to my new cd again. i can't believe that i got to talk to further seems forever and get put on the guest list for another show of theirs. too bad i didn't go. i can't believe mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them. oh well, he is probably just tying to be ""emo"" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with the people that he holds up on a pedestool. why did i ever date a guy like that? and why am i still so attracted to such a stupid jerk? i hate people like him. why has he changed? my stomach is hurting now again. i don't like being sick. i need paper in order to print. and a usb cable. i hate that my printer doesn't work in my dorm. i brought it for nothing. i bought some new cartridge too. its all a waste. i can't return it. well for thanksgiving or something i will bring the printer home and have my dad try to fix it. being home doesn't feel like home really. just feels like i'm visiting. which is really what i'm doing. my nose is itching again, i think i am going to sneeze again. i feel like i've been typing for 2 hours. someone just opened something. i don't hear my dogs anymore. i wonder what they are doing. my stomach is still hurting. the air conditioner just turned on. i heard it. i don't usually hear these things. that's strange. my eyes are drooping. i'm tired. i haven't slept well for a couple days. why does he hate me? i really wish i would just be brave and confront him. i always say i'm going to, and i really think that i am going to, but then i chicken out and if anything, i am extremely nice to him only to have him ignore me. further seems forever was so good the other night. the energy around me at the concert was so good. i was up in front. that was great. the new lead singer was great. i need to go to more places like that in austin. i just typed that sentence with my eyes closed. i am really falling asleep. my parents are talking. i can hear them. my dad is selling my car. that makes me sad because i really like my car. even though i am getting a better car.

"yeah so i am so stressed right now and i am wishing that i wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress. i could get fat!!! i don't want to be fat. i mean i know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! right?!?!? but i am trying to run a lot!!!! that way, i can burn stress and burn calories. extra calories!!! i am having a hard time not getting irritated when i eat a lot. that's weird huh!? that it's when i am hungry that i'm not most irritable. hmmmm well today when i went running, i realized that i should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when i'm tight. and get this! i've lost 5 lbs since i got to school. but how?!?!? i've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! oh well. still i was kind of excited! but i am mad that i haven't started my period yet. my mood swings are terrible and so are again. my eating patterns! and that's when i find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something i don't like. spanish!!! ugh! i want to move to spain and learn it by living with people who speak it! but i really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows english so she is slow to interpret and yet teach. does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh i've heard that word before. and oh i know what it means! poof! i mean we have to learn something before we can know it. did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her mother's womb. no! she was pottied trained. right! well my high school spanish teacher was horrible and i had the worst experience with that . while i got a great grade, i didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! i mean i am glad i got an a but she didn't prepare me for ut where my prof speaks in spanish all the time. not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! would i say to a baby. ok this is how you open your mouth. open it open it. do you know what i am saying?!?! it kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak english well. they aren't trying to be mean but they may say ""hey how are you"" really loudly and you're like ""dude, they aren't deaf! they just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone"" right?!?! grr. so i feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like ""man this girl is so negative!"" golly, i am right now because i see my spanish prof everyday! like i said before. so yeah! uhhhhh well i am excited about this weekend but at the same time i keep thinking of how behind i am compared to everyone else here at ut, intellectually and academically! i mean i feel so insignificant some times. however i know where i get my wisdom from and that is jesus christ who makes my knowing god possible! he saved me from the depths of hell! and even after doubting him so much and having to research jesus' life and creation and all that. i have found that he is the one . he is my sufficiency! i mean who knows more than the god of the universe, the creator of the heavens and i am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually! i mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the god that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) there is just so much opposition to him right now. i mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death. well actually god let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but i just want everyone else to know his love and i really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a ""bible beating"" manner but just to love them through how i treat them. hopefully. i wasn't too negative for . you know what i'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this. please look for jesus with the pre_suppositions that he doesn't exist. expect to find him and i know you will! to his glory alone!

"since i am already on the computer i am going to do 1 writing assignment. that's good because i wont have to worry about it later. i can take care of other things on my list, and i 'll be that much closer to going home. i like my new place. its big and cold and my best buds live there. theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. this fella really has a stick up his ass. i respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. it sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. i can tell this is going to be a problem. we've already had words several times. what blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. i mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year! am i the only one thinking here? i really had to get raw then, telling him that that is not how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. he wants to shack up with me, cap, and bob, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. also, bob's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. i don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. everyone else does. i love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. they're engaged, and she still gives everybody the ""look"" when he leaves the room. i feel sorry for him. but i should probably be glad it's not still me. i think the only reason that i bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like i do. like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. those were some of my best friends ever. i'll keep in touch with them, but when i talk to them i always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. they say they'll be back next semester, but i don't believe. a lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. that's why i stay focused and that's why i'll stay at ut.

"i am eating a hershey's bar with almonds. i told myself that i would only eat one little square of it, but as i can see, that didn't happen. you would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry. for more sweets. that's interesting. as i'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on aol instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words i've already typed, so i have to keep going back and deleting and starting over. annoying. over the labor day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way. on that note, i used to not like having a birthday so near a quote ""holiday"" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and i wouldn't be able to get together with all of them. now that i've entered college (smile), i've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday. to spend with special people (bigger smile). anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) i celebrated my 18th birthday with my family and my best friend. my mom used to attend ut austin, in fact, both of my parents did. unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home. anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years. my dad is a self-employed architect. he used to work for a large corporation in dallas, but hardly had time to have a life. a life away from work, that is. my mom likes to say that when i was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - ahhhh! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: ""look, there's your daddy. "" now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons. my little brother, matthew, was born when i was nearing 10 years old. currently he is seven years old, in second grade. he came as a huge surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile. but obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong. he is very active, and shows so much love that i don't know how such a little body can produce it. right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, patrick. speaking of patrick, i met him in high school. we both attended health careers high school, a magnet school in san antonio. by chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year. that was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together project graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation. actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 1000 students total; around 204 in my class. i didn't get to what i was saying, but i guess i'll leave the juicy stuff for next time.

"it's crazy to think here i am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. i am now a college student. during high school i couldn't wait for it and now that i'm here i feel out of place. sure, i know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names i no longer remember, and i stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what i expected. the classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially ut. i have not had the success i had i hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that i am, i expected it to come easier. i tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. it makes me wonder if i should have rushed, though i do not see myself as a sorority girl. it seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. are they really paying for friendships? i do not think i would have fit in to such a place. i just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that i will meet some people with whom i really enjoy hanging with. i am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next monday. with 30 people in the class, i know i will get to know some of the other students. i never thought i would admit to being homesick, but it is true. though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. however, when we are there we tend to hate it. isn't it funny how that works? i have also decided that austin is a city full of beautiful people. everywhere i look, goodlooking boys and girls. it definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. i enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. should i really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? well, i do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. i believe i am finding competition in everything. whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people i know. the people i went to high school with. the people whom i now want to separate myself from. another thing i have noticed is how sleepy i always am. here i am at 12:22 writing this when i am insanely tired. but why go to sleep, when i do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. there are also a lot of sick people around. the allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere i have been. i have had a cough and a cold since i've been here. it seems like i have so many problems, but i know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. that is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. i know i need to give things time and make the best of what i have.

"very rarely do i just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. at this point, i'm really wishing that i could get some peace and quiet. i've always lived in an extremely quiet house and i guess i took the peacefulness for granted. however, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, i have no complaints about the present state of my life. i'm heading home this weekend, and while i've only been in austin for about two weeks, i feel like this is home now. my house is just like some place i visit on occasion. i can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. either way. what are you going to do. i am just completely blanking on what to write about. anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and i don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. for an arbitrary subject, i guess i'll write about my best friend. she goes to a&m and i will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. it seems strange to be her without her. we talked everyday in highschool. four years. that's a long time. however, i don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. i always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. because, what is inside someone never changes. all of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. i am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like i haven't seen her in a long time. o. k. second arbitrary topic. dating. i am really looking forward to dating in college. i mean there are about 25000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. however, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since i broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. damn, it is so hot in this room. well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. i guess i have a tough time talking about the past. i always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. i'd rather think about what i'm doing right now. memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. what's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. i really don't think that will be too difficult though. when you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. new things to learn, new things to strive for. i love it. i really have no clue how long i've been writing, but i assume i'm pretty close to 20 minutes. mental note to self: pick up new pat green cd for dad tomorrow and call angela. well, this is my stream of consciousness. its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. to end i will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once: never play poker with a man named doc. never eat at a place called mom's. never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe: frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. thank you ladies and gentlemen. be sure to tip your waitress. good night!

"the first thought that enters into my mind is my parents, whom i have been thinking about since i left houston for college. it's so different here, but not necessarily bad. i have always been under the protection of my parents. but here, i don't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed, and what to do. i literally make all my choices, which i have to admit, i don't always make the best decisions. i don't study when i know i should. sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that i know i should, and doing things like going out and having fun. i feel like i should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute. but back to my parents, i feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me, because i am the last kid to leave home. my mom has been crying constantly and i know that she is lonely because she doesn't have me bumming around the house and eating her food. sometimes i even feel sad because i now realize all the things my parents have done for me. even though i thought they were always against me. when i think about the things they have sacrificed for me, i get teary. especially when i think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before i left for austin. i got an acura integra, nothing i had ever expected. i was so ecstatic and i had never gotten such a great present in my whole life. i know that my dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than i had expected. and now i'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that i had taken for granted. i really miss my parents and sometimes i have trouble dealing with it. it's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own. my values are seriously getting tested because i don't have them to give me advice anymore. all i keep thinking is how much i love them and how i can possibly show my gratitude for them. college is a tough thing. even though i went to an enormous high school, it can't compare to college. my classes are huge, and sometimes very monotonous and boring. surprisingly, the class i had thought was going to be tough and boring, became one of my favorites, economy. mainly because my professor, hamermesh, is a great teacher. he is lively and so humorous. the other classes, i really don't care for much. one thing i do hate about college life is the roommates. i live off campus on enfield, in a really nice apartment'condo. my dad bought it with the intention that i have a nice place to live. it is two stories, and i have been trying to decorate it the best that i can. but the problem is that i have to have roommates. one is this white girl, karmin, who i never met. my dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in austin, looking for a roommate and she applied. the other is a chinese girl, laura, i have known since i was a child. i share a room with laura, so karmin has her own room, and she pays a little more. however, i still end up paying more because it's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways. so karmin pays 350 for her own room, which i consider a good deal. laura is really messy, which bothers the heck out of me. but lately, i have been dealing with it pretty well. karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind. she is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household. but she is messy, especially in public areas and i am the one who has to clean up after her. and the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy. she has a big tv in her own room, and vcr and then on the other hand, comes and watches tv that laura and i own. so we are not allowed to use it. i borrowed her vcr the other day, and she asked me, ""when are you going to buy your own vcr?"" still, she isn't willing to share but doesn't mind using our things. same with the food. i really feel the need to tell her off, because she sure is getting a good deal living over here, and she can't have the right to treat this place as her own, she needs to respect us. not only that, she hammered nails all up in her room, knowing that she is only living her for a year and it's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next. that's my biggest problem and whenever i talk about it, i feel really agitated and stressed. well, all i feel now is relief though, because my 20 minutes are up!

" ok. . i;m sitting in this computer lab of this co-op i'm supposed to like and really bond with. unfornuately, i don't like the people very much,it smells, and the kitchen always wreeks of too much garlic (like a disgusting amount. ) oh well. but i really like this keyboard. i think typing on a good keyboard is very important. it can really effect your typing and writing experience. it also has this great squishy thing for my wrists to sit on. all i want to do is pinch it all day. but there are other things i have to do. :) ok. what next. well some say i'm very neurotic, but my boyfriend was supposed to call around noon and i've called 3 times already and he hasn't picked up the phone. it kind of worries me when he's that late at returning my phone calls. then i think about this really great hair iron i just got a week ago and how wonderful it is. it's so wierd that something could make your hair look so healthy when it is actually so damaging for your hair. get this. it get's so hot, that i've had serious burns on my hands from just barely touching it. they don't like to sell this iron to regular consumers (i guess i know why) but i got a special hook up. now here's where i get neurotic. i'm really scared that i didn't turn off the iron this morning before i left and i wanted to tell chad to check when he wakes up. but what if he hasn't woken up because the whole upstairs is on fire and he's lying there unconscious or even dead????? see what i mean? i'm a huge worrier. sometimes i feel that i could strech my brain so far that i could litterly make myself crazy with worry. well, my feeling is. what if it were actually true? you know, bad things have to happen to sombody. why does everyone think they won't happen to them???? well, technically, if i were to leave the iron on, it would probably just deconstruct itself and melt the plastic tub underneath it. but it could get hot enough to start a fire, i guess. you never know. well now i'm getting hungry and i'm trying to decide how to spend my time before going to psychology at 3:30. i have to put a note on this girl's door so she can help me find a replacement so i can get out of the god-awful place and then i have to check my labor assignments and then i have to check the phone book for the nearest cell phone provider so i can get a phone charger replacement. whew!!! quite a day. oh, and i have to cancel an appointment with my dad because i just want to spend a few hours with my boyfriend. it that so wrong!!!!???? i saw my dad for 3 hours yesterday and he still wants more time the following day!!! sometimes people just drive my crazy.

"well, i suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise i will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. but, let's back up and get the basics down. for graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. new, being the operative word. so they told me to go find one that i liked and tell them where it was. my mother and i went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. we thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. however, they went to see my uncle's family in dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. so i ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. my dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because i cannot get online. so i spent saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. it wasn't. my uncle drove in from dallas on sunday and took windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my c drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, everything seemed to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. now i am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called ""computer doctor"" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't i'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. so i wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when i could have been in the music room practicing. and i'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where i should be. but my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. so i didn't practice at all this weekend when my professor says i should practice 4 hours a day at least, and i just got a bunch of new music and now i'm totally screwed for my lesson on friday. i also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is, and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night, and since we have the class everyday, it's not like we can procrastinate at all. it's very frustrating. or maybe it's just me. i don't know. all i know is that i haven't even typed for ten minutes yet and i'm still complaining. it's not like i usually procrastinate about anything anyway. i mean, i was valedictorian of my high school, i think i know something about time management. although, being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat. i went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts, and had the highest number of ""unexcused absences"" you could have without being held back. and i wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation. so i guess i know a little about procrastination anyway. but i had a reason for waiting that long really! when it was certain that i was going to be valedictorian, everybody started giving me tips, like they knew what they were talking about. ""don't make it too long, i'll pay you five dollars to say my name, don't make it too boring. i don't want to sit through some damn boring speech. "" even friends' parents were giving me tips. everybody wanted to know what i was going to say, so i just didn't even try to come up with anything until the last minute, so i wouldn't have anything to tell them. most people like me speech i guess. i worked in a favorite quote of mine by theodore roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try. it's a really encouraging quote, and i always used to repeat it to myself when i went to violin auditions because i am an extremely nervous performer. i also used to repeat that thing from dune by frank herbert that the main character paul used to say ""i will not fear. fear is the mind killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear. "" etc, etc. it always sort of helped me get a grip on myself i guess which i need because i'm a very insecure person. and i'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because i have to use her computer and she's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed. it's only 12:34 though, and she always goes to sleep around midnight which i think is weird. but then i'm an insomniac and i can never sleep anyway, so i'm usually up until about three. i also am a coffee addict. have been since the age of seven. i think it usually surprises people that i've been drinking coffee so long, but my dad used to drink at least a pot a day, to that was a drink that was always available. you'd think it would have stunted my growth, but i'm 5'7"". then again, my brother is only 15 and he's 5'9"", so maybe i would have been taller. maybe not. i sort of like my height. hmm, i've got two minutes to go, and i lost my train of thought, so i guess i'll just keep typing until something comes to me. oh, i'm listening to the soundtrack from ""schindler's list"" right now. i totally love that movie and the music makes me cry. music always makes me emotional, but this cd is played by itzhak perlman whom i personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world, although joshua bell, who did the soundtrack for the ""red violin"" is also really good, but younger so he doesn't have as much experience. i'm sure he will be so much better when he's older though. well, it's been twenty minutes. it was interesting. a little personal odyssey of the mind there. bye!

"this week has been so overwhelming! i have taken in so much and my mind feels like it is in overdrive. i already feel stress and the semester has barely begun. i want to be involved in a many ways as i possibly can, but there are so many organizations to join, i don't know what to choose. the difference between college and high school is readily apparent. i hope as time goes by, i will develop better study habits and get used to waking up early. i am extremely nervous about the first exam in all of my classes because i do not know what kind of questions the professor will ask, and therefore, do not know how to prepare for them. tonight i am glad that i get to go out and do something because i feel so couped up here in this dorm room studying all week. i am also excited about seeing my boyfriend and cousins this weekend. everytime he calls, i light up with happiness. no matter what kind of day i am having, i always feel better when he calls. i still miss my ex very much though. two years is hard to let go of especially when they have been your friend for an even longer period of time. i wish he would just call me because i really want to talk to him. we used to talk every night for hours and hours. he was such a big part of my life and now i barely see him, let alone talk to him. i think that he is mad at me because i am dating someone else, but i'm not sure. he usually returns my calls, but i have not talked to him in like 4 days. i am really hungry and i would love a big bowl of icecream. but i can't have one. i am really trying to stick to this stupid diet because of all of the ""freshman 15"" horror stories. i wish i had more time to take a nap during the day, but when i'm not studying, i'm working out or running errands. another thing i'm worried about is having two finals on one day. my mythology and calculus finals are right after one another and they are both very demanding courses. oh well, i guess i just have to make the best of it because there is nothing i can do about it. thank god i don't have three on the same day--then, i would really panic. i'm thankful to have julio because he really pushes me and encourages me when i am doubtful or discouraged. i miss him so much more than i thought i would. i have only been with him for a month, but i already feel attached. i hope my parents like him when they meet him this weekend. hes so smart and has good manners. their approval means a lot to me and i guess ill find out what they think of julio this weekend ",0,2.084861 -0.315835 0.234716 -0.123805 0.205234 -0.391243 0.136756 -0.68597 -0.046226 -0.601806 -0.130735 -0.590446 0.436429 1.230581 0.552447 0.0 -0.04277 0.567264 0.563566 -0.48131 0.464993 -0.437102 1.278382 0.501061 -0.624052 -1.090866 -0.099497 0.425154 0.90113 0.578677 1.214663 0.37784 0.700361 2.380052 -0.273227 1.363826 0.28775 1.030171 -0.156293 0.123055 -1.038726 -0.643146 0.190795 1.061847 -0.583274 1.599599 0.916676 0.693495 1.861991 0.664554 -1.34699 1.493047 -0.766564 1.338186 -0.86242 0.01428 0.006412 -0.954251 0.417469 -0.824797 -0.506516 0.782753 0.112107 -0.206248 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.338738 0.0603 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.125388 0.227767 0.496009 -0.737102 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.544887 5.107649 4.455086 4.549155 5.244292 4.113293,858
"i have been feeling so different when i arrived here at ut. i just can't believe that i graduated from high school and now here at college. the atmosphere is different here. i feel like i belong here. when i first arrived here at ut,i was scared. i was afraid about how am i going to get from class to class. it's just different here. i'm worried about the exams. there's only 4 exams per class. i'm not used to that. i guess i'm used to spoon feeding from high school. ut is just soooooo huge. i didn't know that ut was this big after orientation. i'm just afraid of my classes. i'm afraid that i'm going to fail. i feel like i'm slacking off. i do my homework and read, but i still feel like i'm failing. i guess i have high standards for myself. i want to score the best that i can get. i'm just afraid that i'm going to drop out of ut. as long as i push myself to stay on top of things then i'll be ok. after the gone to texas , i feel like i choose the right college. i definitely felt like fit in. my major is nursing. i kind of lost in finding a major. when i was a kid, you would dream about what you wanted to be. i always said that i wanted to be a doctor. now, when i think about my future i don't know what i want to be. i volunteered in a hospital and i notice that the nurses are so nice to they're patients. i want to be one of those. i want to be the one who helps out and put a smile on the patients. i want to work with children. after nursing school, i want to become a nurse practitioner. it's just like a register nurse but higher. a nurse practitioner gets to prescribe medication. that's almost like a doctor. everybody is like why don't you want to be a doctor? i'm afraid of malpractice suits. i'm just my dream is to work at the texas children's hospital in houston. it's close to home and i like working with kids. they are so much fun. i just hope that i can make it through school. college life is just so different. i miss my parents and my brother. i went back home during the labor day weekend. i miss my mom's home cooking. what's weird is that when i left college, my parents got a little puppy.

"i love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since i last wrote my entry. i have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. i had english today at 9 am and really enjoy it, i like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which i like also--more of a high school feel. it is my birthday tom. and i am not excited about it because i have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. all my friends are already talking about where to live next year and i am not sure why. they all say that things fill up so quickly. i got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, i guess i had assumed we would live together next year. college is so much money. i feel like at every corner i turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. i am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, i am doing some babysitting though. kids are my life, i do not know what i would do without them. i was thinking the other day, my dogs back in houston--do they know i am gone? it made me sad to think they have no clue if i am ok, i am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. my phone is ringing but i think i will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, i have gained a lot of weight and i can feel it, i am slower and get more tired quickly. i wonder how it will feel to 19! almost 20, i feel like just yesterday i was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times i miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but i miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. right now my friend connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. she is thumbelina, so cute. there is a vacuum going on in the background, i really need to shave my legs. and lay out. my brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, i miss him also but sometimes i wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. i want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. he already has two. i am a theta and i really like them. tonight i am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as i do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. my e mail is broken and i am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. they are so slow. now my friend has left the room, i feel like i can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and i am not hungry. i am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at acc and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, i think the tv show jerry springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. i love beanie babies, they are so cute, but i do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!! i love the summer and am sad it is almost over! my 20 minutes is up so bye bye.

"i am about to go to my first sorority date dash with my boyfriend. it is at malibu grand prix. we are going to drive race cars and play video games. the tv has a show on about a man that slit a nine year old's throat from ear to ear. i think that is disgusting. i can't believe our society has people like this. i am very excited about my date dash. however, i have been feeling very overwhelmed with school lately. there is so much reading in every class. i don't feel like i am ever going to get caught up. college is so hard. tomorrow i need to go get a new backpack and shirt at the coop. i am excited about the football game on saturday. this is my first college football game. i think it is going to be very hot and miserable. i will probably complain a lot and want to leave at half time. my friends say that they aren't going to let me leave early. it should be interesting. i also have to go straight to work after the game is over. i am going to do a lot of homework on sunday. hopefully i will get a little more caught up. i feel very stressed about school. this week is better than last and hopefully next week will be better than this one. i know it is going to get better. the guy on tv is a psycho. he is now saying that god told him to sacrifice the boy. he thinks he did the right thing. that is ridiculous along with the insanity plea. it makes me sick that people can do these horrible crimes and then plead insanity. this guy is not insane he is just a sicko and i think he deserves the death penalty. tomorrow i have to go to class from 9:3011:00 and then i'm going to take a huge nap. i haven't been getting enough sleep lately. i guess i will just get used to less sleep. this college thing pretty much sucks. sometimes i wish i would have taken the easy way out and gone to the local community college. however, i am getting a much better education here at ut. i live at home and commute everyday. this is really stressful because i have to leave my house at least one hour before class actually starts. i am about to go out now and i think this was a very interesting assignment. i am probably going to be late to the house where we are supposed to meet.

"4. 57 checking in don't know where to start. i do this a lot though kind of relieves stress like candles and music and flowers haha really girly, huh? oh well, i guess that's me more like a girl on the inside. outside is just comfortable. god, my hair is annoying. it's hot as hell, too thick curly hair doesn't go well with the texas heat i'm writing and all i'm thinking is that if you really do read this, how exactly am i being judged man, this could be an essay about me and my identity and how i interpret myself but that wouldn't let you decide for yourself. and i'm way into that. i want to decide. it can be good, bad, whatever haha it's funny when it's a bad decision, but always an experience my japan far east competition in volleyball bad time to get caught volleyball captain, a lot of responsibilities damn, i miss volleyball but i don't know if i could survive it definitely something fun to do, but no. rotc takes way too much time hahaha only 24 hours. i remember korea shoot i didn't even know what it was to sleep unless i was riding in a bus getting somewhere awww away trips those rocked memories. friends. love. trust. heartache. god, i miss korea. i can't believe i talked to keith and marry i miss them a lot this college thing is really cool, but dang, nothing compares to serious friendship. i miss my baby damn the fact that he's way younger. it doesn't' matter. i'm tired of everyone's ""idea"" of what is right for me. i loved him for that i can always be myself. whatever that is we'll see. i wonder if i'm going to ""find myself"" here haha this is the place for it, right? ~~bisexuality~~ i mean it's college and all i'm supposed to understand life and myself and who i am and what i'm like this seems more like an email i would send to phillip we were always like this like reading each other's diary in an email. i wonder what he's up to there are a lot of people like that some that i wouldn't mind forgetting about but why? they all touched me in some way haha that sounds sexual i can't believe i admitted to mars before tat or seo or anyone i didn't think i could talk to her like that it takes a lot of guts on both sides for us to have what we have i love her for that i know she feels guilty. we'll see hopefully this will be a lifelong friendship i'm so lucky for that and i thank god for it not like most people: only talk to him when they need something it's funny how religion works it's only prominent in people's lives when they are in need of something then again, i guess that's how a lot of things work i am learning, though not the innocent, little, trusting girl i used to be or at least, not as much haha korea taught me that i owe my life to that place more the people than the actual place, i guess. more seo than anything i love him i should feel guilty i should actually be censoring my thoughts right about now but, i guess that wouldn't be the assignment. i love ben. i love seo and i would die if i didn't have both of them in my life selfish? i don't know isn't everybody in some way? i think as long as all the people involved accept and are comfortable and happy. happiness is so important. it's funny when people are happy. i don't have to be happy but i couldn't live with myself otherwise so many things play on happiness love. trust. comfort dang, i think i said that before this is something i would send to mr. clausen i hope his father is okay i would know how hard it would be for him if he wasn't damn. csm i hope you're watching over me and i know i do some pretty messed up things stuff you wouldn't expect from me but, it's the truth i guess that's a good thing knowing me for who i am maybe it's not all good ben would die if he knew the entire truth can i live with myself knowing i cheated him???? i don't know air force honor code ""i will not lie, steal or cheat or tolerate among us anyone who does"". do i absolutely have to live with that? isn't it, after all, my decision who will know, right?

"this comp science lab is pretty nice and i'm kind of confused about what to say or do here. i mean i've been thinking about all this stuff lately and now that i come to write stuff down nothing really comes to mind except filler, you know, the kind of random thoughts you think that don't really mean much at all, i mean look at this thing i'm typing right now! i didn't make the band but that's ok i guess more time for geology 401 and matt isn't in it either so its all good. i want to go swing dancing tonight but jeff isn't there (well and rob's line is busy so its kind of bunk) cause i take the bus, but it doesn't run as late as i'll be out. anyway. um well lets see i guess i'm supposed to be writing about what i'm like thinking and stuff. actually i'm wondering if anyone will ever read this, so i'm somewhat apprehensive: i've been thinking some pretty damn personal stuff lately so i don't really want to broadcast on the world wide freaking web. i also just typed a profanity and replaced it with a euphemism. i guess that's in case someone actually reads this too. cara. hehehe that was cryptic, wasn't it?? see i'm kind of giving a vague notion here. i just type what i think. so there you have it. wow five minutes and my wrist feels funny. the fac typing things. keyboards, i mean. they aren't very ergonomic if you know what i mean and the surface of the desk kind of hurts. replace keyboard. well it looks like matt is getting into this assignment, too. which is really kind of cool when i think about it. it will be interesting to me to actually go back and read the thing, cause i'm always editing what i write but now i'm just kind of going forward. relax. i don't know let me see well i'm kind of hungry, isn't that like part of the id? i always heard about that-- you know, along with superego and stuff hey check it out i just read the instructions while i was typing that line and i didn't even miss any keys. not bad eh? this is kind of odd for me in another way, too because i'm a linguistics major and well see i know most of the stuff they teach in 306 already, but the professor seems cool enough. no more high school. ten minutes to go. living at home is ok. i can take the metro bus. matt is cracking up. if you read his (that's ""kay, matthew"") you probably shouldn't count it as much cause i can hear him stop typing to re-read what he already wrote and that's not ver continuous, now is it? i hope i have enough money for food this week. $20 has to last me. i hat this space bar it sucks a lot. you have to hit it real no really hard just to make it go. see what i mean?? i hate it when people use adjectives instead of the proper adverbs. how hard is it to put on a little anyway? my generation doesn't care, i guess. she's so smart. in fact she went to duke when she was a junior in high school. damn it i get mad just picturing her somewhere else having fun with someone else. but its cool i don't have to worry. or so i say. how could someone so awesome be alone for long? no no no. i only see her once a week. it will never work. okay. well no i'm better. i didn't mean to go all mushy, in fact i'm thinking about going back and deleting that stuff. you know, in the name of science and all. isn't that weird how i use the second person? as if i actually expect it to enhance readability or something! i guess i'm trying to make this whole thing like a very one sided conversation. click click goes the happy little keyboard. my fedora is on the table. i learned the other day that its a bush hat from australia and not really a fedora but its all good because i still think it looks good. people think i'm funny wearing a fedora all the time, but i don't care. they can just piss off. i get lots of indiana jones jokes. loss. i'm at a loss here. ever since that paragraph where i talked about her it got all funky and now its happening again. no. i have a striped shirt on that's white and burnt orange but nobody said anything. i guess that's ok but i thought it was really nifty. 20 minutes seems like a long time at first but then i guess when you get to the end of it its not really well damn matt is looking at my screen, that bastard. i had to stop typing for a sec to make him look away. i guess he didn't see anything deeply embarrassing. rrhahahah well times up. i want my cookie.

"i love this song. it reminds me of plano, and when i hung out with my old friends. i wonder where they're at right now? i wonder if they're ok, and if they're doing well at college. where's my roommate. he should be back by now. he must be eating. i wonder why this c. d. keeps skipping, i know it's not scratched. i can't wait till tonight. i can't forget about my laundry in twenty minutes. it better still be there when i go for it, or somebody's losing a leg. actually, i trust most everyone on this floor because they're all pretty cool and i've met most all of them. the guy down the hall, he's pretty cool, he just isn't used to texas life. the heat yes, since he's from hawaii, but the people no. should i rush a frat, or not. there are many great advantages to this, but i really don't want to join a bunch of guys i don't know and find out they're a bunch of losers, or drugees. i guess i'll never know until i decide to join, it's just whether or not i think they're cool. a lot, if not all of my friends, have joined a frat, so i can find out who likes their frat, and who doesn't to figure out which one i'd like to rush or pledge. i'm actually rushing them all, because there is no reason not to. my sister will give me the drop since she went here not to long ago. i'll ask here and get here to help me out because a lot of her friends are alumni's of the better frats. this part of the song is the best. it always makes me feel so happy, like i could do anything. wait one sec, i have to sing along. dangit, when is susan going to call back, there are so many plano people here in austin i feel like i'm at high school all over again, just a bigger neighborhood to party in. i don't like driving here to much because there are no medians, and the speed limits aren't posted anywhere. i'm not used to having to drive sooo aggressively here. i mean i always drive aggressively, but i wonder if people here take offensive driving, instead of defensive driving. now it is time for me to go take a safe walk, since my car is so dang far away.

"september 4, 1997 i am not too sure what to write about. i am hungry right now. i have anorexia nervosa, so i not only am constantly thinking about food, i also won't allow myself to eat it when i want it. i am actually in the recovery stages right now. i have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. the only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. that treatment would be out of state (in arizona) and would last at least 60 days. it doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. the battle is all in my head. it is my mind that will not ""allow"" me to eat when i am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me i don't need to gain weight, that i am not critically underweight, and that i am physically in good shape. the whole thing is very confusing to me. my psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. i think this class is interesting so far. i have enjoyed reading in the book already because i deal with this stuff on a daily basis. i am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. my psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones i am taking this semester. (i think she's a little partial to the subject myself. ) i have to go see her on tuesday, which is only 5 days away and i am scared half to death. she scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like i said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat. right now, she has threatened me by saying i will have to go to the treatment center if i haven't gained 15 pounds by a certain date. that date is coming up in two weeks. i have had this agreement with her since the end of june. i am really very scared because i really do not think i have gained near that much. it's strange how i can think about it realistically and know that i am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me i am fine and don't need to gain. but, as the date comes closer to my appointment, i will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. and still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing. you have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder. you won't want to do it, you'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go. i have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital), but i haven't been able to do much of this by myself. it seems like it isn't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety. instead, by ignoring it, you get to feel hungry, tired, irritable, you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight, you make your family freak out, you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to college. it seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten, and i can logically see that. my mind is just totally screwed up, which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase. i hope i will make it to the point soon. it's just all too confusing to explain. i am sure everyone thinks i am crazy, but you just can't explain to someone how you feel. i wish there was a cure or some more insight to it. i am interested in what this class has to say about things like this. maybe i'll get some more insight into it (if that is possible since i live it!)

" i really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. it's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so i guess there is not much we can do about it. when i listen to music, i like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but i parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. i also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. music helps me go to sleep also. i can never really fall asleep to it, but i will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. i've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. why is that? usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, i also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. i still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that i know they are ok, makes me feel better. even if i keep going back to the same part of the dream i try my best to get them out of danger. i have a very strong family background. when i was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect family and that nothing could ever go wrong. i always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. one of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. i don't think i could handle my mother calling me a name like that. i think i have a very good relationship with my mother but i know that i don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. i've noticed that i have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. i guess that is because i'm afraid to trust one person so much, but i don't think that is a bad thing. i just think that i'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. i guess that is because in junior high i had a group of friends that turned on me and i don't think i ever forgave them. i went my own way in high school but to this day i still think of their betrayel and i can still feel the pain from it. even though i haven't always had the best friends in the world, if i have a falling out with a friend i usually will make up with them later on in life. we might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. that also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. i've always been able to make friends with guys better than i have with girls, i really do not think i'm that much of a tomboy but i just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. my first year in college was the first time i think i made more girl friends but that also might be because i'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. i don't mind girls i just think they have more issues than guys. i also think it's really weird that i haven't found that one single person yet either. everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but i think i'll just let it happen when it happens. like even if i like one guy, there is almost always another one. i think i like like four guys right now and its terrible. one has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. he doesn't know i like him but his friends do, it's crazy. i think i've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. if a hot guy walks by i just turn to mush. i think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. he would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. he would also have to be a talker, i'm really into having good conversations. don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship i've been in has failed because of some communication issue and i think i've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. i think i am a good communicator fo. r the most part, i know i'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where i had two sisters and one brother i guess its no surprize. i've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. i can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and i think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what i do. not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. i've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. i work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me.

"i'm tired, i just cleaned our apartment and now i'm tired. but i feel satisfied that i cleaned the whole place. my roommate is extremely messy and is hard to live with at times but i've known her for 15 years and i love her to death. now my mind is being tracked to when we met at the baseball field when pur older brothers were at practice. evan, my brother is now is africa and i miss him a lot i think it hits me in waves. i wonder what it's like there, hot and rainy i suppose but i wonder if he misses us as much as we miss him. i think he probably does he just doesn't hank about it as much as we do. my boyfriend lives in college station and i miss him too. it feels silly at times though to have this person you love and car about so much to have them so far form you let you still can keep close. technology is incredible. i'm able to talk to evan once a month. he's in africa for goodness sake that's an ocean away. i talk to michael every day usually more then once. now i'm getting hot, and i'm so thank ful the ac just flipped on. i find it hard to believe people were ever comfortable without the air conditioning. this summer at the camp i worked at we didn't have an ac in the cabin and i got used to it. i fact i would get cold when i was in the ac. but still the comfort of it is much better than without. i miss camp i miss my campers. it's the one place that i really feel at home way from home, i am so confident there. not that i'm not here i just have been there for ten years and have grown up there. all my best friends are there. of course i have other good friends but there just f=something about living with someone for three months that gives you a new look at them . they learn your morning routine and you there's it comfort thing because someone else knows you so well that they know how you wake very morning. i miss those guys. and it's not like i can't call them or even hang out with some but i don't. isn't that strange that i love these people so much yet i don't call and hang out either them. yes they call me and sometimes i don' t call them back because i'm nervous. why? i don't understand my strange want to be with people but my stronger want to be alone and watch tv and just do nothing. i need to start working out again, i t has been so long since i have i think i would have more of a desire to get up and go if i had more of a pep ""i just worked out"" kind of look on life. i really love lance armstrong. he had inspired so man people to get in shape and be healthy and support the fight against cancer that you just have to respect that. i also respect him because he had the same cancer my daddy beat. that was an awful time in my life. freshman year found out that my dad has cancer. he's fine now but wow that scared me he wouldn't be here for so many things that he has seen it's incredible. medicine is absolutely incredible. it makes me appreciate everything he does a lot more. funny how even when he was going through all that awful stuff i was pretty unaware. my parents kinds kept us in the dark. not like i asked but we just didn't talk about it. i feel like i really don't know what happen to him during those months except that he got better and now he's doing great. i wonder if he still thinks about it everyday or if he's let that terrible memory flee from his mind. wow he is one funny man, he can say anything and i'll laugh but i guess that's how it should be. he should be my hero. i wish every girl had a daddy like mine i think the world would be a make more relaxed kin of place. he always makes every tense situation funny and more laid back. my mom is the opposite and i wonder how hey have been together for 29 years when they are so opposite . but i know she loves him and i think he loves her. he does he just doesn't always shoe it in front of us but i'm sure he does to her. he'll do really sweet stuff like on valentines day. i think she just needs to relaxes a bit and realize that not every situation needs to blown out of proportion. wow that was really neat.

"my thoughts i have never tried to write about my thoughts before, so here goes: i'm sitting in my dorm room just where it is quite hot for some reason even though the air conditioning is set for the coldest setting, oh well, i guess dobie isn't perfect. my suitemate sure isn't any good. i hadn't seen him for the last two weeks, but as soon as i put a tv in the living room, he shows up. lousy moocher. now i have to listen to my headphones because he is watching some stupid movie. these things make my head hurt, and i don't like the music i'm listening to, stupid backstreet boys. my girlfriend loves them, i sure do miss her. she lives in houston and goes to hbu, she is so nice. she isn't anything like the other girls i know, she never complains, and always does whatever i want to. i'm lucky to have her. i'm afraid that this long distance relationship thing won't work out. that would suck, i don't know what i would do. my head just hurts thinking about it, or is it just these tight headphones. they aren't even mine, they are my roommate's. he is a great guy, one of my best friends from houston. he just got back from his girlfriend's dorm room. she lives upstairs, and that isn't fair. he gets to see her all the time, i only get to see my girlfriend every two weeks or so. i guess that could be good too since i need to study a lot. i have some big shoes to fill, both my brother and sister went to ut and they were both in the business school, which i couldn't get into. sometimes i feel stupid compared to the two of them. my parents really want me to do well, and i hope i can make them happy. if i try really hard, and get a little lucky, i might be able to transfer into the business school. that would be cool. i feel sorry for my mom, and i am scared. she needs a liver transplant, and it isn't fair for her. she wasn't a drinker or anything, she lived a very good life. she just happened to have a bad liver. that's why i hate mickey mantle. one day a friend of mine was talking about how we should give free health care to everybody, but i totally disagreed. i told him that we shouldn't help the drunks and druggies, and he thought i was crazy. that's when i get really pissed and started yelling about how stupid celebrities like mickey mantle get to skip people on the transplant list, get a new liver and then drink through it. after that they get to take another one, then he died anyway, that is the only thing that made me happy. they could have given that liver to my mom, rather than some stupid lush who just killed it. someone told me that he had a disease that he couldn't stop drinking, i say bs. he could have paid someone to walk around with him to make sure he didn't drink any alcohol, but my mom can't do that. she just has bad blood, if we could pay someone a hundred thousand dollars a month to follow her around and keep her healthy, we would do it in a heartbeat. we don't have that option. well that's twenty minutes, i don't know if that was exactly what you were looking for, but that is pretty much what i was thinking, and that was pretty fun!

"i swear that office space is the funniest movie i have ever seen. ""yeah, hi!"". ""it's bill lumb. "". i can't stop laughing. albert is on the bed hugging a leopard pillow. jo just emailed me from st. louis and i don't know if she's okay. i haven't talked to her since i left for school. she is okay to take care of herself i guess. i can't believe that pami, liz and katy left for dave without me. they suck, oh well. i'm doing fine myself so i guess it doesn't really matter, shit, i've got the place to myself. college life is pretty bad ass. no one really cares what i do, well i guess my parents care. oh well, i guess i'm in another state and it really doesn't matter. liz is so retarded that she bought a poster about the movie breakfast at tiffany's. she picked that out of all the bob marley and pink floyd posters there. i guess that is just her style. ""i'm going to have to ask you to move again to another office"" ""that would be great"" but i set the building on fire. it is so funny i can't even stop laughing. i wonder if kenny is going to call tonight. i really do wonder how much longer i will really be with him. i love him to death but i'm to young to have a serious boyfriend. al is so funny. he looks like he would be all buff and mean but he is really complete goof. he tries to get all big so he can impress the ""ho's"" but he doesn't understand that he can't do that. he's to goofy. just kidding. he kicks ass though so i guess its all good. i can't believe my dad made me add another class. schools already been going for about two weeks and ill have to make up the work. plus all the other stuff i have to do. i want to be able to go out more, and have fun. that's what college is for. i'm still going to study a hell of a lot but also party too. i don't want to miss out on anything and then have to feel regret for not doing all that i'm allowed to do now that i'm in college. i don't understand why everyone is freaking out. i guess their just freshman, well so am i but oh well, and they will get in the hang of it soon enough. peace out psychology its been twenty minutes.

"i was wanting to get that pre-testing stuff out of the way, but like most every body else in the fucking class i logged on right after the class, and now the damn test site won't respond. knowing me, i'm going to forget about it or something. i was just in the mood at the time, and it was on my mind you know? so now i decide to polish off something else (this thing) in hopes that when i'm done, the other will be free. before i go on, i know that you may read this and think, boy this kid sure is edgy or sure gets irritated about a lot of stuff, and you know what? i do! anyway, since i'm on this whole you know what i hate kick, i'll just tell you things that irritate me that have happened to me recently. for one thing, the battery in my watch went out this morning, and i went to buy a new battery for it today, but can't replace the old one cause i don't have a fucking screwdriver small enough. so now i'm walking around campus wearing a watch that doesn't work and continuously looking at it to know the time. and every time i look at the damn thing, it's blank and i remember that it doesn't work i get mad at myself. and soda machines piss me off too cause every time i really thirst for a particular drink and push the button for that particular drink, i most always get something else. and of course you're left with this drink that you don't want, yet you don't want to just throw it away cause you just spent your last 60 cents on it. anyway. . ok so how's the family? good? that's great. no serious3e4ly to continue the theme of today's ""stream of consciousness"" let's talk about music. now, i listen to all kinds of music ranging from frank sinatra to fear factory, so i not judgmental in terms of genre of music, but my friends and i go out from time to time to see bands in austin perform that are, in our opinion good, without record deals much less mtv support meanwhile talentless bands successful solely due to sex appeal (bush, no doubt in particular) thrive. now you may say, but alan what about the spice girls do you hate them? and my answer oddly enough is no. why? cause they are all about sex appeal and they know it. bush and no doubt actually think they're serious musicians. times up.

"as i start my third semester at ut, i feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. first of all, i'm excited because this is probably the first semester that i feel truly comfortable with my life here. i am living with my sister which is so good for me. we get along really well and i really enjoy spending as much time with her as i can. also, my exboyfriend is at ut with me now. he is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. but fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. it enabled me to find out who i was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at ut. because of our time apart, i made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. so, this year, i not only have him with me, but i also have all the friends that i made last year so that i don't depend only on him. my best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. her boyfriend came to ut this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at ut meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. she spent most of her time in houston visiting him. as a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. although, i know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, i realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, i fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. she barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. but i try to hold this against her because i know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. but other than that, i'm really happy with my social situation right now. it is a really good thing that i have this support of all my friends at this time, because i realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. i am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. in the first week, i already am swamped. although i know myself well enough to know that i will definitely finish all my projects, somehow i still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters i will have to pull (especially when i think of the fact that i have 8:00 classes every day of the week!). and i would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that i will have to build because i know how expensive they get. but, i realize that with the huge load i have so far, working is almost impossible for me. if i could have my way though, i would work at a restaurant in town. i worked at pappasito's over the summer and i really loved waiting tables. i met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. i think the reason i loved it so much was definitely because of all the people i met. there were mostly guys that i worked with and they were all so friendly to me. we would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. i got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. it was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. it gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself.

"hmmm, i am eating a chupa chup lollipop right now. it is really good. i don't know what to write because i am trying to just think and when i do that i think about thinking and well, i'm not exactly making sense, but it doesn't work. i am tired. look at that phone book. wow. my roomate is blow drying her hair. there is a meeting tonight and she is running for something. i don't know what. historian, i think. my mom was so mean to me last night. i try to tell her things about my life and she says she doesn't want to know. she does, she's just afraid of what i'll tell her. i'm a good person. i haven't done anything bad. she just doesn't want to know that i have a boyfriend. but, i think she does. she probably doesn't like the guy because he's mexican. that's stupid. how can a person limit thier options of people to love to just those in their race? if i didn't think being gay was disgusting, i would say it made sense. why limit your options to people of the opposite sex? that's silly. but, i'm not attracted to women, so i don't leave women as opption though. sometimes i think i don't want to get married. there are so many people getting divorces. i don't want to get divorced. i wish i were a man. they have it so much better. they don't get a period. they don't have to go through labor. now labor is something that is very special and in a way i think it's very cool that i can experience it, but when i took a child development class in high school it really scared me. i don't think i'd make a very good mother anyway. at least, i'm afriad i wouldn't. but back to why i wish i were a man. men can pee while standing. not fair. and they don't even have to take their pants down. again, not fair. men get wrinkles, they are distinguished. women get wrinkles, they are old. men get in a fight, they are just releasing that testosterone. boys will be boys. women get in a fight. bitches. men sleep around and they are considered studs. women sleep around and they are called sluts. not fair. of course, no one ever told me life would be fair. men and women are not created equal. i don't really want to be a man. i'm accustomed to being a woman. well, i'm not a woman. i'm still a girl. i don't want to grow up, i'm a toys r us kid. there's a million toys at toys r us that i can play with. from bikes to games to video games, it's the biggest toy store there is! i don't want to grow up cause baby if i did, i couldn't be a toys r us kid! i really don't want to grow up yet. my my observations, adults generally have very little fun. adults are always stressed out. i find myself stressing and getting very tense about things. i must be careful about that. i think it's important to stay young at heart. there are times to in which people must be serious, and that's important, but it's also important that people know when to let go and smile. i love college. i thought i would be so homesick when i came here, but i'm not at all. i love it here. i feel so comfortable here and i don't want to go home. i love my parents and the rest of my family, and i guess i miss them sort of, but i'm not homesick. i love austin. i want to stay here forever. well, not forever. i want to get out of this country. i want to go everywhere. i would go anywhere i had the oppportunity to go. i don't care where. i want to go everywhere and learn everything. i hope i never lose that feeling. i hope when i am an old woman that i will still be hungry for knowledge. i know that i will never be able to learn everything there is to learn, but i'm going to give it my best shot. it's funny, i look out my window and the sky is so beautiful, but there are all these buildings that are contradictory to the beauty of the sky and nature. if i do live in a big city like austin, i hope i will be able to go somewhere like colorado, where i can get back to nature. i think that's important. i don't think i want to live in a big town though, if i have children. i want to raise children in a small town. not my home town though. the people there are extremely narrow minded and they think the would revolves around that little town. no culture. i wonder where i will live when i am older.

"goodness gracious! i am so tired of returning to this page that i absolutely don't know what else to write about nor say except for help! this is like my fourth time trying to complete this assignment and i am so tired of it but it is to late to complain now so i might as well shut up and continue on writing or shall i say typing. it looks again like i will be going to bed after midnight, i hope not but i do have a lot of assignments that i still need to complete. my most important assignment will be to get organized because going at this rate i will have a hell of a freshman year just trying to keep up. i am doing a little better now with following my syllabus but i still have a long way to go. maybe when i get a job i will learn how to manage my time more wisely and i will be able to develop better study skills. my fiance' tells me that i have good study skills i just worry to much and stress myself out over small unimportant things that have nothing to do with my classes or myself. to be honest, i do believe that i do get stressed out over every little thing but i think that i am getting a lot better at handling different situations, like this one. my biggest problem is that i really miss him and it is so hard being here in austin all alone while he is in north carolina. hopefully after this year we will be able to come up with a compromise and a solution to all of our problems and concerns. i miss him and i am really looking forward into seeing him in a couple of months. well, my time is about up and i really need to go so that i can begin to tackle my other ut coursework. i have to make my grades so that they won't make me.

"i know that i have assignments to take care of but i do not want to complete them. i know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, i still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. but that is were the apathy sets in again and i will not take action. it seems like a cycle that i know at my house. my dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, i could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. i do not blame him, i just see a pattern that is similar to mine. but at least i am working now. i still have german 506 to complete that is were i am most suffering. i need to review, and starting to catch up before i wind up failing. it would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. at some point i have to break this cycle but sometimes i don't think i will. but i must press on. if i don't turn it around, on my own now that i am in college, i am afraid i never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. i have to start putting my foot down. tonight was a good start. i told my suite mate who i am very good friends with that i could not go see a band play with him. instead i opted to stay home and do work. however, only now i am beginning to work on it. that is very disappointing . it seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. i will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. it will be very nice to get away. the depravity of this city seems to be catching me. or rather i am slowing down to let it get me. waco is a much different society than austin. i cannot be lure d away. then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. waco has all the same trappings, i just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . now i can fall and it doesn't look that i will stop. i cannot think like that. but any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 3 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed i need to work ion to improve myself. i just know that this cannot go on or i will star5 to pay some very hefty consequences. my dad always told me before i left for ut that i would be greatly affected t by the people i surround myself with. i can see how this is partly true but i do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. i will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. i will be in control of what it is i will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. this is the time for me to start caring. i am not sure what else i can talk about. i have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. my mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and i need an escape. perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. i don't believe that i have much longer to continue writing on this assignment. two very large priorities for the even9ihng that i still have to take care of is my german, which i have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow i return to work and i need better clothing than what i am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. it may seem late, but if i am outrunning that new leaf, i am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. my mind is growing blank and i believe that i should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic.

 i'm really happy i started my workouts today even though i feel awful right now. i need to get back in the shape i was before the marathon. i don't really feel like going out tonight at all but i have to go because i promised my friends. i'm not really big into parties i think they are sort of stupid i'm always really uncomfortable because i don't really know that many people except the guys they go with and i feel really weird just following them around. oh well it doesn't really matter i guess everyone there is drunk anyways i really want to go home this weekend and see zach i really miss him a lot i wish we could have both gone to the same school but we couldn't. thanksgiving is really far away and i don't know if i can wait that long to see him. we have been friends so long it feels really weird not seeing him everyday there are some good things about being here i never have to see ross or trevor i hate those guys. i would like to lie and say they taught me something about myself balhaablaha but zach was right i never needed either or them. dating zach is so weird but being friends first makes it more special. i really miss sharon i can't believe she is going into the army in two days israel is so far away and i can't believe i won't see her for two more years. kayla is at texas state with nathan and says she loves it i hope her and blake get back together she just loves him so much i feel bad that she's sad about them breaking up with him and i don't really know what to tell her. i miss the basketball team so much i have pat and kellan here with me but zach and maury and matt and nathan and dotun are so far away i hate it i guess maury and zach aren't that far away dallas isn't that bad. its sad though i won't be able to go back and see ben and dipot and my brother play since my parents moved i'm sad i won't be able to go to reno with zach anymore but i guess he decided to stay home iwht me for christmas so andrew and dotun will go by themselves without us christmas is going to be so fun with him i know zach feels like he will never mean as much to me as ross but i feel the same way about amy i think we both know what we have is different but i really don't like talkinga bout it with him i would rather just ahave fun together like we always do we know what we are to each other and i don't think we need to keep talking about it. i'm over ross for good this time same with trevor and no matter how many times they ask me i won't get back together with them i don't think zach believes me though i don't konw what i can do to make him no so insecure about us i don't know whatever hell figure it out eventually. its hard to talk to him though i could never hurt him though i just know him to well everything about him we grew up together so i know all the things that hurt him and he knows all the things that hurt me so i don't know if i could ever accidentally hurt him or say anything that would make him sad because i know exactly what those things are. he knows those things about me too i think its better this way to know everything all the wounds a person has when you are with tthem there ar eno secrets between us because he was the person i always told me secrets to and he is still that person i go to so i don't understand why he thinks i will break up with him inever will he will have to break up with me because i refuse to hurt him i would never cheat on him eitheri love him too much and i respect him too much i think it is just awful when people cheat on each other i don't think its the worst thing you can do but it is still terrible you should care enough about the person to end it before you deliberatly hurt them that is just mean and selfish i don't think i could ever do that to anyone but especially to zach god i've tlaked about him way to much i think but who care nobody will probably ever read this i miss him a lot i think its weird what happened alst weekend going up to visit him will be awesome in two weeks i can't wait i miss him so much he is really starting to look like ben i ,1,-0.97602 0.509607 -0.044506 0.600921 1.568203 0.625436 -0.763833 -1.180645 -0.678153 0.734882 0.465084 -0.590446 -1.595131 -0.590971 -1.450865 0.0 -0.04277 1.88927 0.027364 1.624231 0.466263 -0.019036 2.404789 0.339225 -0.624052 -1.885814 -0.748317 -0.624411 1.271416 -0.295582 0.545321 -0.091574 2.193808 -0.25716 0.08495 3.285803 0.935444 -0.398873 2.2581 0.220779 0.291922 -0.834854 0.416662 0.528148 0.575693 0.111928 0.573602 1.783098 0.026805 2.593564 0.223907 -1.163482 -0.837225 0.877585 0.119827 -0.39328 -0.441285 -0.954251 0.559564 -0.263458 0.607448 -1.12961 0.221534 0.212593 -0.229283 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.780723 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.477761 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.830342 5.061408 4.181773 4.730888 4.539154 4.775505,2392
"i've never really thought about what i'm thinking before, there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket. that's ok though because this is a dorm. they are talking now, wait i can't here them anymore, wait they just started talking again. i wonder what they are talkig about, probably something unimportant. i really need to find out where the fine arts library is so i can do this gay reading list. i don't even have a clear understanding of what i'm supposed to do. i assume i just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something. it is really annoying becuase the class is already 4 hours long. there should not be any outside work, but i guess it's not too hard, and if there are not any set boundaries there isn't any set grading material, this means that it is basically completion, much like this assignment. i really want to go to the texas ski ranch tommorrow but i can't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time i could leave would be around 5:30. i hope they have put up some pimp sliders and kickers out there. if anyone reads this and you wakeboard'wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pimp ass supra launch ssv and your willing to pay gas money contact me. because i'm always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself. my roomate is sleeping right now. i can't decide if i like him or not. i don't dislike him, but i can't imagine myself being a really good friend of his. it seem our only link is that we are roomates. he seem like a little bit of a jesus freak and a dork. that would suck if he was reading this right now, it's ok, he's not. but you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them, that you can talk to them. you know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable. you can never tell that when you just look at a person. it seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with, that you feel completly comfortable with. you feel you can be yourself, act stupid, laugh, you become a different person when you are around those people. i only noticed that fact this year. this year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me. i don't think i have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other. i don't know what spurred it, but i think i know. i know i know. it was a girl i just got to know this year, but when i realized how important she was to me and how much i liked her she was taken. in my self pity i couldn't find the strength to tell her how i felt. i think i was scared of losing the friendship we already had. i didn't want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual. i should have just told her and gotten it out in the open. she changed my life. i got the idea in my mind that to be with her i would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship. she was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape. i still think about her and i know in my heart i will pursue her the next oppurtunity. the weight loss brings to mind another point that i have noticed about people. for as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit, it's bullshit general (bulshi ",1,0.510676 -0.503289 -0.363358 -0.536832 -0.257363 -1.551207 0.149971 0.383006 0.287475 0.094938 -0.108935 -0.590446 -0.147349 0.309922 -0.097099 0.0 -0.04277 0.681961 -0.942837 0.129541 -0.959882 3.526534 1.034815 0.129142 0.938808 0.246306 -0.492113 -0.533466 -0.868747 -1.128387 -0.418716 -1.09808 -0.017378 -0.09983 0.078304 0.710942 1.528935 0.233343 1.679788 0.277696 0.063465 1.479569 -0.641854 1.105044 0.439038 0.25614 1.569619 1.526822 0.057356 2.189121 1.092746 -0.564522 -0.227175 0.380652 0.355585 -0.653463 -1.862524 -0.338208 0.193277 0.835635 -0.884922 -0.138607 -0.044245 -0.348525 0.636807 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.427216 -0.036191 0.06762 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.05066 0.431668 -0.147847 -0.477295 4.763757 3.748113 4.34061 4.738846 5.242326,1567
"why do i always analyze things to the point that i completely stress myself out about it? i find myself doing this time and time again. i feel stupid, i can't believe that i let jaime set me up on a date with someone that i don't even know. to top that, i barely know her. what was i thinking? the way that she is talking, he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever seen; however, i am really scared that i am going to be really let down. i know that sounds really negative, but i guess it sounds too good to be true. it doesn't make sense to me how this whole thing works anyways. your sorority tells you about a party that they are having, giving you only two days notice to find a date. to me that is completely weird. i just don't have the guts to go up to some random guy and ask him to go to something that i'm not even sure will be fun myself. oh well, it will all work out. now, on the other hand, i'm all about going to the pledge line tomorrow. i couldn't believe that someone asked me. it made me feel so good inside to know that i was one of the few girls to get asked! i don't know what my problem is; it just seems like i can't stop thinking about how much weight i think that i need to lose. it seems to be the only thing that i think about any more, and i don't know why. i don't think that there is anything wrong with me, but then again, maybe there is . you never can tell any more. all i know is that there are so many things going on and not enough time. i wish that my body wouldn't go through such big ""swings"". one minute i am bursting with energy, and the next i can't even keep my eyes open. it is as if a person is holding onto my heels and making me drag them for hours on end. after dragging them for so long, you just can't drag any more. this tiredness that sweeps over me comes frequently throughout the day, but , without fail, it comes each day between 2pm and 5pm. i want to be like others that are comstantly energetic, skinny, and seem to get everthing done with no problems at all. i guess that is only a perception in my mind that only sees things from the outside instead of how they really are. does that make sense? why can't there be more hours in the day. i feel like ever since i have gotten here, all the time in my day has flown by, and comtinues to fly by without even slowing down. which is fine with me as long as i don't leace things that are really important to me out. unfortunately, this is what i have been forced to do because i my new schedule. before i came to school, i worked out daily so that i could relieve all of my stess, and feel good all at the same time. now i can't even find time to get to class--much less work out. i wonder how nolan is. is such a sweet little boy. ever since he was born i have loved those kids, and had a compassion for them that no one else could ever have. i can't believe that catrina came up to me and asked me about ryan murphy the other day. i mean talk about digging up painful things that have already been buried!! whenever she said something, every bit of hurt and anger inside of me came back like it was just yesterday that it had happened. i need to put it past, and forgive and forget. that is at least what i know i am supposed to do, but it is so hard! why do i get attached to people so easily? that is one thing even i will never know.

" there is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. he's eating cereal. sometimes i am jealous of this, because he has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. even quinby has his own place with a kitchen and everything. someday i will have these things for myself. my own life, with my own things. like in days of our lives. there will be days of my life when i do what i want, with whomever i choose. until then i must continue doing things their way . everyone else's way, like my mom. my nose itches. it is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a scratch? it is very annoying to itch. when i got sunburned, i itched extremely badly. sara laughed at me because i was jumping around in discomfort. i never want to feel like that again. sunburns suck. i miss sara though. even though i did not see her much, i always knew she was just down the street. but things are different now. that made it sad for me to leave. the fact that she isn't down the street anymore. that was like a security for me. just knowing. i am in a hurry to finish this assignment. i have to be in class in about half an hour, and i am nowhere close to where i need to be. life can make you feel like that. like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. everything in never alright. that's and oxy-moron. things don't work that way. but things do tend to work themselves out. you just have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. i always want something better. i feel like i am always in transit. it's had for me to be happy with the present. at least i can let go of the past, now. that was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. still, i look forward to, and fear the future. i do know things are good now. i am on my own, a little bit. i don't want to rush things. i am in no hurry to grow up. well, not a big hurry at least. i do want the rest of my life to come. i want to marry quinby, have a house, and pets. i am going to have a rabbit. maybe two. kids eventually, but not for a long while. the television is such a distraction! i can get side tracked forever. i like how it takes me out of this life. it is definitely an escape.

"i'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring, i wish i had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe if i turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. i don't know how i'm going to be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. i can't help but stare at the posters to kill time. i'm particularly fond the print of monet's sunset at venice. there are so many things i'd rather be doing right now, like watching tv or sleeping. well i'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 6 minutes has lapsed. i wonder just how many of these the professor'ta's actually read. i know i wouldn't want to have to read any of these. hopefully i did well on my biology test i took today. tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. i still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which i will more than likely put off until sunday. only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. i thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. i can hear people talking out side. normally i would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. i wish i had a laptop so that i could type this elsewhere, and i think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. i wish i could go to the game saturday, but i didn't get a ticket. last week's game was really exciting. only one more minute. i just wish this were over with. i can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. i can hear music playing in the next room. i wish my stereo system was that loud.

"this is beyond weird! i never thought that college could be so exciting and scary at the same time. it is so weird how my thoughts have progressed through these two weeks of college. i never thought that things would be this independent. i am finally away from my mother and father who always told me what to do since i was a tiny little ballerina princess. no more telling me what to do or when to get back. and yet the weirdest thing about all this is the fact that i feel no urge to go out and party on sixth street. i guess all that time my parents were telling me what to do and when, was all taken into consideration when i moved up here. in changing the subject, i just came down with a throat infection and it is the worst ever. i told my parents that i had to get my tonsils taken out a long time ago but they never listened to me. it is not fair. i had the worst night's sleep last night and to top it all off, i have to catch up on all my class readings which means no catching up on sleep. i am such an observer when it comes to just walking down the street or on my way to classes. it is so funny how people i know act in a bizarre way around others compared to how they act in front of me. the other day i caught myself looking at a little boy no older than seven years old, and he caught my eye because he was on top of his dad's shoulders doing the ""hook 'em horns"" sign with his tiny little fingers. it was the cutest thing because it reminded me of when i used to get on top of my father's shoulders and do the exact same thing. in a blink of an eye though, it all seems but a distant memory. it is so weird how i always dreamed of going off away from my rio grande valley life and coming to live my life far away from all the kind of people i could not stand. do not get me wrong, i loved my family and ""real"" friends, but there was just something about that town and how everything ran on the game of politics. it was all about what kind of car you drove, where your family came from, how they were connected to some of the richest people in town, and so on. it all meant nothing to me in the end because the way i saw it was soon i was getting out of there with some place to go where people did not care about things like that. i accomplished everything i wanted in high school. the highlights were getting head drum major two years in a row and winning homecoming queen and getting to conduct in my white gown in front of my band, my family, and in front of everyone in weslaco! it was an awesome day. the best days were when we would attempt to study for an extremely hard economics test by going over to someone's house and actually doing no studying at all. those were the best because even though we saw each other in class, it was just on a 'hi' and 'bye' basis. when we got together, we would get each other caught up on the latest gossip and laugh about the stupidest things all the way into the night. somehow, we all managed to pass the test the next day and we all felt better knowing that we had connected the previous night. talking about people in our school was the main thing because our school was made up of all kinds of want tobe's, gangsters, stupid people who actually fooled everyone into thinking they were smart, and so on. unless you were in band or on a varsity team, the people you hung out with were not at all your friends. it was the best feeling knowing that so many friends were there at band practice everyday and tennis as well. i would have to say the only thing really excellent about my old school were the faculty. my band directors were my closest friends and still are to this day as well as my tennis coaches. they always went above and beyond the call of duty to try and help with whatever i needed. now that i am gone, i guess it is time for them to help raise another bunch of good students and friends. i feel really good leaving that small town, not knowing what to expect out here in austin. my morals and ideas my parents, friends, and teachers taught me through the years will always remain a part of me no matter where i go!

"i want to listen to more music. i don't know what song to download next. but oh well. i love listening to music when i study. i wonder why? i like listening to rock and alternative. that is weird i guess. most people would listen to classical or other soothing music. but i like studying to louder, cooler music. i guess that makes me weird. i wonder how things are going at home. i want to go back this weekend, but i know that i can't. i have a lot of work i want to do, and i really want to finish my calculus before the due date. i should sign up for tutoring down at jester. so far the class has been ok though. i understand what the teacher is saying, and i am not having that much trouble with my homework. i hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend. but i know that he is going to be really busy with his internship. he has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work. i guess i may be asking to much of him. i don't want to pressure him to come, so maybe i won't mention it. i still wish he could come though. i wonder how molina is doing? she is like 5 months already. she is getting pretty big. i wonder if she knows that natalie is having twins. so many girls are pregnant back home, that is kinda sad. most of them are really smart, and they could have done so much with their lives. i'm cold. i wish i could turn of the air conditioner. well, at least it's better than it being hot. norma still hasn't figured out how to turn off her alarm yet. it keeps beeping every hour. it is getting on my nerves. i wonder if i take the batteries out if she would mind. i'm thirsty. i should get some water. but i don't want water, but that is all i have. i need to get a job. i don't know how i am going to pay for the spring semester. i can barely pay for the housing as it is. i need more money. i hope everything is going ok at the ranch. we need the place to do better, or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school. i don't want to quit, but if it comes down to one of us having to leave, then i would rather it be me. my brother is doing well, and my sister only has a year to go. i have only barely started, i can wait a bit longer to go to school. till then, i can help out at home, and work with my parents at our restaurant. my foot went to sleep. i should move so it can wake up. i have so much work to do today. i need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class. i wonder how my friends are doing in class. i want to see vanessa. she should have told me that she got married 2 weeks ago. she said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married. that is a stupid reason. how can someone forget that they had gotten married? i won't get mad though. i am happy for her. i wonder if manny will ever ask me to marry him. sure we have talked about it, and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together, but still. knowing him, he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because i could say no. it is just like when he wanted to ask me out. i knew he liked me and he knew i liked him, but he couldn't ask me. so i finally made him ask me. i said,? we are not going anywhere until you ask me. ? so he finally did. i hope him asking me to marry him won't be the same way. that is definitely not how i picture my future husband proposing. well my time is almost up, but i need to keep going. norma is back in the room. she can never get her days straight. she just left again. i guess she is going to the bathroom. wow, time is almost really up. time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking. i think that is really cool. oh well. my time is up now. but i am still thinking. i have pretty much said my life's story, that is really weird. i thought all i would put down was how my day had gone. you know, like a lot of crap just to fill up space. i should stop now because i have a lot more things to do. i think i will stop now.

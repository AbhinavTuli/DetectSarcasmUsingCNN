man
jericho
cane
arnold
help
trusty
sidekick
kevin
pollack
stop
nothing
let
devil
take
world
parts
actually
absurd
would
fit
right
dogma
yes
film
weak
better
blockbuster
right
sleepy
hollow
makes
world
enough
look
like
star
film
anyway
definitely
doesnt
seem
like
arnold
movie
wasnt
type
film
see
sure
gave
us
chuckles
well
known
oneliners
seemed
confused
character
film
going
understandable
especially
ending
changed
according
sources
aside
form
still
walked
much
like
past
films
im
sorry
say
arnold
maybe
end
action
days
speaking
action
film
hardly
explosions
fights
devil
made
places
explode
arnold
wasnt
kicking
devil
butt
ending
changed
make
spiritual
undoubtedly
ruined
film
least
hoping
cool
ending
nothing
else
occurred
let
also
dont
know
film
took
long
cost
much
really
super
affects
unless
consider
invisible
devil
minutes
tops
worth
overpriced
budget
budget
gone
better
script
least
audiences
could
somewhat
entertained
instead
facing
boredom
pitiful
see
scripts
like
get
bought
made
movie
even
read
things
anymore
sure
doesnt
seem
like
thankfully
gabriels
performance
gave
light
poor
film
walks
street
searching
robin
tunney
cant
help
feel
looked
like
devil
guy
creepy
looking
anyway
youre
glad

movie
dont
bother
see
youre
expecting
solid
action
flick
neither
solid
action
another
movie
suckered
seeing
due
strategic
marketing

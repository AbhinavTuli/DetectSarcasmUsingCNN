"i have tried on three different occasions to do my pretesting for this class and the stupid computer tells me to try again later. why should i try again later. i'm already going out of my way to come down here in the first place. my dad hasnt brought up my computer from home yet so i have to come down here when i need to get online to check my email or whatever i have to do for class. it seems that everything is done by computers these days. take this class for instance, i am handing in my writing assignment via some electronic force. i'm not actually handing in paper anymore. its all done so technically and confusingly. have i mentioned i absolutely hate computers? its not that i don't think theyre useful, its just that i'm not exactly copmuter friendly. well actually, i'm willing to be its friend, i just don't think it likes me too much. at home the only thing i knew how to do was check my email and write people back. oh yea, i also knew how to get to microsoft word and to solitaire, but that's about it. here there are so many options on what i can do, but don't they understand that by giving me all these options, theyre really doing me harm instead of being helpful. whoever made up computers must be very smart. sometimes i think about the things (technologies) that we live with and do in our every day lives, and it just boggles my mind. how in the world did that guy--i forget his name--- come up with a device called the telephone. i mean to even dream up of it and then to actually make it work. sound travelling through wires--- this is a crazy world. if the world had been populated with people with about as much intelligence as me, i know for a fact that we would be the most uncivilized dummy-heads roaming the earth. sometimes i wonder what the world would be like if there were none of these technologies. i don't think technologies is neccesarily such a bad, currupting thing. i mean, it is peolple who are inventing it. it doesn't come about on its own. like you know how some people think tv is so terrible, or those religions who don't allow light bulbs or radios in their homes because its like the devils advocate or whatever-- i don't see how some people believe the things that they do. i mean, wake up and think for yourself. who am i to talk, i'm not all perfect in the catagory of thinking for myself, but i probaly have a better sense of things than a lot of other people--or maybe not. life is confusing. that's probably why i'm taking comparitive value, contemporary moral problems, and psychology. can't wait to get to know myself better.

"i don't really know what to think about really anything. i mean some things are so clearcut and others just float off like there is no answer or any point in thinking about them. why do i cry so much. why do i need to talk so much why do i need so much. i don't know all the answers and i don' t know all the emotions either, but i do know that sometimes i feel different and like things aren't right. and how do you know when things are right. is brian right just because my head is telling my heart that he is cute and cool and what i maybe have been looking for? but then other things i just know are right when lilly and are goof off and are being silly we have so much fun. but then how will they all think of me when they know the truth and is it really that big of a deal or is it because i make it a big deal. oh my gosh it has only been three and a half minutes. what is wrong w' me? my arms will fall off before i finish this writing assignment. but really who will know if i don't tell them but i want to tell people and have them love me and speaking of people i know and love i wonder how kelsey is i hope she has made some more friends who are girls. i know that i can't be there but i hope that she does make some because she needs to realize she is more than just a body and a set of boobs to them. or at least i want her to know that and maybe i should just say things like that. wow my arms hurt. but i have been typing for a while already and the blinking light from aol instant messenger is going to piss me off so i have to turn it off now. ah. so much better. now i can concentrate and not really concentrate wow i love paradoxes. i wonder if you should or rather could say paradox like with the funky ways of making plurals like alumnae and alumna and stuff like that. and is swang really a word when not used as a term for dancing or in the more rural and uneducated parts of the world. and in america how many places are really uneducated and how do we know that we are uneducated. i mean after all who are we to judge. i don't think that there is any person who can judge either other people or themselves. but we all do it and anyone who says that they are not judgmental are flat out lying. i mean really. i am going to try and move my keyboard to a new position to better accommodate my wrists and arms and fingers. i hope that i get a ticket to ou weekend. and better yet i hope i get a date. i would like to go there w' brian, but i don't know if he likes me or is just pressured by other people, like my friends, into thinking that i am some kind of cool. i wish i could just know but that is not my place. i don't get to know things. i think he feels obligated and just like the she daisy song i do not want to be anyone's obligation. i have too much pride and maybe i have so much it will hurt me, but i don't want to be anyone's' obligation until they decide themselves that they want to care for me. i don't want a person colossal who feels obligated to me because of what i have done or what people say about me or whatever i want some one who will want me. why doesn't anyone want me or do i not let them see me and if i do let them see me am i risking everything i work for everyday to make sure that i have a pretty face to show the world but i seem so unfriendly sometimes like at meetings. i don't try and meet the girls especially the one who looks like mel's sister because it makes me think bad things. but oh i am a horrible person. why would anyone want me especially with all this bad karma and not that i believe in karma i just believe in the modern translation that it relates to the soul and goodness and badness and evilness, but i am evil and i have all these negative thoughts and i am not bitter though, at least i pray to god that i am not bitter because bitterness really does breed filth and hatred and unhappiness. i want to be happy and praise god with all of my song and being but all these things get in the way and other stuff and i am so unhappy about stuff sometimes. i just need to cry and i want a big comfy shoulder to cry upon and someone special to hold me tight and say that everything will be all right. that is from some song but that is what i want. i want the security of a guys arms wrapped around me but i know that is not really security that all that is is a cheap imitation of what god can give to me through jesus. but i just right now would love to be wrapped up in a great big hugpreferably with brian around me, but i don't know. i hope i don't get obsessive about him like i did with tony and with jonathan and so many other people. i just think that things are good and that i feel really comfortable around him but at the same time he reminds me of all the boys i hung out with that were bass's friends. and that is cool because they were cool but i don't know if i am deep down cool enough for brian and all of his friends or if i want to try. but i do, but only if it is the right thing and if it is then god will bring it together but i know that i have to do my part and pray and think of what god can do and not worry about other things but it all works out in the end. god keeps us safe. it all works out.

"wow. i have a lot of books. ok, it's about 10:04. i tried to start this thing a while ago, around 8, but my girlfriend is over, and i'm helping her learn german. i've had a lot of german classes. anyway, i'm going to marry her. sometimes i'm afraid of the commitment, and the choice, but every time i'm with her, she makes me feel confident. when we go play tennis, study (as we are doing right now), or just about anything really. hmm. hsinju got the job at the noc. i don't know if bobby is just putting on a kind facade or what. so many guys are like that. maybe females, but i never really know. but guys are. they are great and pleasant until they're in the company of other men. wasn't that a movie? in the company of men. yes. had a yellow and red cover to it, i think. speaking of which, i need to watch those videos from vulcan. what a great place. cheap too. no quite as cheap as my dad's though. i wonder what rpm is going to be like when the evil giant faceless megacorporation finally gets its butt in gear. it seems like i've spent my entire life fighting against corporate america. fuck blockbuster, fuck starbucks. but now that they have bought out rpm records. well, i'm glad my dad can retire in ease with all that dough. but i feel like i've betrayed myself. how can i be so gleeful about it? sure, rpm fought the system, and won. we never went out of business. several times, the megacorporations had to buy us out, not boot us out. but it's kind of like becoming a traitor for some quick cash. like judas. that was one hell of a judas kiss. $250,000. wow. anyway, i really hope my semester pans out well. i'm really liking the idea of the english teacher class i'm taking. the teacher seems friendly. reminds me a lot of mrs. hagar. and what luck, a german in there too! woher aus deutschland kommst du, mein neue freund? i think it will be exciting to get to practice my german. that reminds me, i need to go drop that ger 218 class i'm taking. i don't think i'll really like it. and i can get enough practice helping stacey anyway. i wonder what i should add. so much is riding on these up coming semesters. did i mention i love my baby? i'm going to propose to her sometime in october. on a hot air balloon, with a large banner on the ground that says, ""will you marry me?"" i think it will be great. so romantic. except for the balloon operator. stacey has low self esteem though, at least when it comes to academia. she's so smart, but she just needs to practice. at whatever. she's goofy too. so much fun. i'm actually getting a bit tired. i've been writing for about ten minutes now. i think i want another drink. that crangrape juice was good. hmm. sleep would be good. tennis would too. i think i'm too tired for tennis tonight. i may fall asleep during the movie. studying and writing is tiring. i don't miss home. garland, that is. austin is great. so much better than that rotten place. everyone there, my age at least, had one single goal: undermine everyone else. ugh. it's been 20 minutes. bye.

"i am pretty up set that this is my second time on this assignment. the computer i did this on the first time disconnected the first time i did this exercise. i wish i had time to do it over yesterday but i had to study. studying is taking up alot of my time. more than i expected i would have to. i didn't know that college would be this tough. oh' this is my favorite part of scream. to bad that i have to keep writing. i really dig this assignment. i think it is pretty cool that the ten points is free. t he assignment isn't that hard to do if you can find time. that is one thing that i wish i had more of. i wish that reading come a hell of alot easier than it does. i just wish that the first time would be enough. but for me it isn't. i wish that some times i was as smart as some people i know. the load of school is really beginning to weigh me down. i guess you guys will label that as stress. i always feel that i am being constantly studied in psy. i always wonder what that would when i do a certain thing or think a certain thought. i really enjoy the class but i am way behind. i have a lot of reading to do in that class . i have alot of catching up to do. especially in that class i am way behind on the chapters. i just want to have some time to do the things i want to do. i want to go an play basketball and lacrosse or just watch tv. i just want to relax and have fun . studying sucks. it makes me sick and it never leaves my mind. always know i should study but i don't. i am so lazy when it comes to doing the tings i have to. man the moving is getting good but i don't want to tell my roommate to turn it off. i like it to o so i wouldn't to turn it off either. i sure do think this twenty minutes seems to be taking a long time. you think that it would go by quickly but not when you want to do something else. i am really excited about next week when i go to see nate and emily in dallas and memphis. i hope i can get a better car so i can make it. i am also excited about the football game this week when we sit on the 40 in row 5. that's sweet. i think this is taking so long. you guy's should make this 15 or 10 minutes long next time. too bad we couldn't do that for the other two due in december. i am two shy to ask the prof. in class, maybe after class or before. he'll probably laugh in my face when i suggest it. the last four minutes are taking too damn long i just want to finish and do something else. i want to watch the movie and not study. studying blows. i wish things were a hell of alot easier. the clock is going to slow. i am sick of writing. this is taking too long to finish. i want to do something else than this poop. the writing is getting very boring. there is another good part of the movie coming up. the movie is pretty good and i have to do this crap. there it went the best part and i missed it because of this crap. it may seem harsh but that is what i am thinking right now and that is what you asked for. yeah i done with this.

"my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty'sweaty boy. i came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. i am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. i'm usually a really fast typer, because i've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and i did as well, but when i came to ut i found out it is totally wrong for me. i just switched to retail merchandising and i'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than cs was. i think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, i can't even see my life without one. don't think i'm a dork just because i said i was in cs, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy'simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and i believe it. there is just so much to do online. i feel like i might be typing bad, but i'd like you to excuse that. i'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. i wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. i mean i'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so i totally love paris hilton, she is such a riot. i think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but i wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. i want to read it, i think it will be amusing. on a side note, i'm not really sure why i'm eating cheetos, i don't really like them, just every now and then i crave them. i absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. i just dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in your teeth. i really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. i never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because i'm starving and i just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. i hate that. how are you suppose to do something that feels like eternity. i feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. i was going to do it earlier but i was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once i did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. i still have to go back and finish that and i dread it. however, i think my boyfriend is entertained now because i can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh i'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. i have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. i feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, i know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. i hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. i hate how little kids are so fat today. i wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat anything. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done all their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day. crazy crazy. i wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. i'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. i can't imagine it not being computer timed. i can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important? that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere i guess. i'm so hungry its not funny. i'm glad i don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. i feel like my mind is going blank because i'm so bored. i wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. i'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because i know i'll be over the time if i wait till 4 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so i'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even. i feel like i started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm i can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. i don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because i don't know when i started so i dont know when i can end and just go on with my life. i wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. i feel like this is pointless and i'm past my typing time. i have no concept of time, but i don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach'boredom. ouch i just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad i'm not on my computer cause then i could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting. 3:55 will be the new time for completion. 3 more minutes. and i'm stumped. i don't know what to type'talk about. ooooooo 2 minutes and counting. ok randomness: i am not sure what i'm going to do tonight, i might go to a party or something, however i'm not going to dress up really cause i'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . times up.

"why do i have this pimple? why does it matter what people look like so much? i am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. i am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their ""body"", because their new ""body"" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. i went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. my best friend and i had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. he has a girlfriend, and i just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. it was horrible. it was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially ""accepted"" you had to have a beer in your hand. now, one might think that would be an excuse, but i didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. for some reason, i want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. thanks. :o) well, it was so dumb. my best friend and i walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and i'm not all about that. i am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. it doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. i am more a people person. i like to make people laugh. i don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way i am. i have this quirkiness (thanks sooze) about me, but i love it. i don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because i am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when i had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. my whole life, i have been nice, and i go by the saying ""nice guys finish last"". i had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is ""nope"". i was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. okay, i know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. i hate using the word ugly, and i hate judging people. i don't. i always hear my friends going up, and saying ""aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"". okay, first of all, i am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. why? why does it matter what he looks like? why can't he be a nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. how he treats her. what he does for the world. what is up with this world? i never say that shit, because there is no reason for it. i hate saying ""oh, he is ugly"" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, i am not the best looking guy on campus, and i have no right in heck to say that. i hate hate when my friends say it. but, it's the world. college was supposed to be different. the time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. it hasn't quite been that, and granted, i have only been here for a couple of days, but i am scared. i am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. i mean, i go out and meet people, but i don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. we say when we leave ""see you around"", but have you realized the size of this campus. it's freakin' amazing. there are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. it was supposed to be different. i mean, don't get me wrong, i don't have 12 eyes, and i have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. i get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. it's not that i am looking at all, because i am in love with sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when i walk into a room, people stare. i promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, i would get those stares. thank you for your time.

" the kitchen is so sterile and cold. i must say that this is a bit intimidating; writing your thoughts down on an electronic module for someone else to analyze and decide who you are. my mom keeps looking over at me. i can tell she wants to talk to me but i am avoiding her glare without trying to seem rude. it's really making me sad that i have to move back home from living on my own. i hate not having a space that is mine and i always feel like i am hurting someone's feelings with my disinterest in their daily lives. my dad calls like 5 times a day it seems whenever i am home and that creeps me out. i hope i don't end up like that. very clingy. my feet hurt. i wish i could go change shirts because the kitchen is so cold and this tank top is not doing it for me but i am filling out this what-ever-you-call-it. i wonder what people make of me in general. im sure their impression of me on paper is a bit different that in person. that makes me sad. i think i come off as more uptight than i actually am although i still seem like a hippy no matter how hard i try to suppress my bohemian leanings. my hair is so short i can feel the cold air on the back of my neck. it is so like my dad to keep the tempature of the house so friggin' cold during august that i want to dethaw in the heat. susannah seems to have gotten along fine without me this last week and a half now that she has moved into the co-op. it hurts my feelings that she only cares about me when she has no other better option. i am her best friend though but still, i hate feeling like the backup. i am not the backup for ian, however. he is so sweet. i can't believe he decided to drive all the way down from colorado to come visit me. i miss him so bad and it hasnt even been a month yet. i feel like a hormonal boy, this is how much i miss him. kissing is never the main part of our relationship definately but my body seems to be confused as to where he has gone. where has he gone? i really don't see the good reason for him moving off to colorado though and not even immediately starting college there. i know that whole band thing but i really think it has a lot to do with his family. between those two huge families, god, that boy doesnt stand a chance as far as an independant existance. his mom, kathy, is so fucked up though. i can't believe she left jay for that abusive asshole. i hate that guy so much; such an ass. i am tired and i will be pissed off if shyla doesnt call me back soon. she is leaving for dallas tomorrow and has put off seeing me for two long of a period. she is no longer my best friend and i am no longer hers but she, for some reason, cannot accept this and instead always makes it out like i am rejecting her or something when this is not the case at all. if anything it is the other way. she totally ditched me this summer and then has the audacity to claim i am pushing her away. ouch. good thing we really arent close anymore or else i would want to cry. i can't wait to see ian. saturday night or sunday morning? i wonder when he will come in. it would be so cool to have him come into the cafe while i am working and surprise me. well, i guess it wouldnt be a surprise if i secretly expect' hope for it. i was so nervous today in italian. god, can i type fast. my hands just can't seem to keep up with my thoughts. much like my short legs can't keep up with my stride and thus, i walk in fast short steps, very embarrassed. ian's long legs are a hoot next to mine. i think he is a whole foot taller than me. we also weigh the same. talk about weird. he is skinny and i am vuluptuous . i hate that clint thought that feminists were all whiney bitches. that's just like saying all christians are homophobes. simply not true. damn, the phone just rang and it was my mom. she calls me even on her errrands just to tell me that shyla called. how more nosey, clingy and in general annoying can you get? i am tired of mom and dad always calling every second they are away. those are two people who do not need cell phones. my fingers are cold. sometimes i wonder if i have bad nerves or something because my fingers and toes are always cold it seems. i am so nervous about my italian one class. all that pronounciation in front of strangers and an intimidating teacher. it freaks me out to an extent that i can hardly even mutter prego. i am such a shy socially inept dork but i love it all the same. okay, i was just imformed that the 20 minutes are up. goodbye. for now. until you enter my thoughts again.

"the timer is already on 15 seconds and i was thinking what to write. i am waiting for my boyfriend nathan to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. the fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because i stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. i guess i am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. i am so tired. i do not want to go to my nutrition class today. it's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. i have so much homework to do also. i just found out that my e-mail in the ut directory is wrong and i have no idea who to contact to change that either. my eyes are drooping so bad. i have so much to do today and just not enough time. i need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after i go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. i'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 3 minutes and 47 seconds. it feels like i've been writing for a lot longer already. i guess i should be lucky to even be on the internet. my dorm, (dobie), has had a lot of problems with ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when i awoke, my internet would not work. it really sucked. my room is so dirty and i need to clean it. i hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. my stomach hurts because i ate too much at lunch. the food wasn't really that great today either. i shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. i need to start eating a lot healthier than i have been. i feel bad that i have been cheating on my diet. it was a protein'no carbs diet and at first i did well, but lately i've been cheating. i need to go to wal-mart today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. i can't beleive she's getting married. i'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. three of the 5 of us are already married. my eyes are soooo tired. i just want to crawl back in bed. i really really wish today were friday. i can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. next week is our first full week. i am so ready for this weekend. i am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. the phone is ringing. it is my boyfriend, nathan. i'm explaining to him that i have to get off the phone because i am doing this assignment. okay he is gone now. i told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls i'll probably be in my 3:30 class. sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but i love him so much. i just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. it's even harder now that i'm in school. we hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 5 p. m. and i don't get out of class m-f until 5 p. m. by that time both of us have to eat dinner, and i have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or i go see him. seguin isn't really that far. but it is an annoying drive. this summer we're supposed to move in together. i almost wonder if we'll still be together then. it makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. he's the best thing that has ever happened to me and i've never been happier. i've also never been sadder sometimes. i guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. if we live together this summer, we're going to live in san marcos. i wish we could live in austin, but he would have to drive to san antonio every day. oh well. i still have six minutes left to type. i need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. they came up to see me on sunday, but didn't get to stay long. it really is amazing how our relationship has changed. they finally respect me and give me my own space. before, me and my parents argued all the time. now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. i know it's just because they miss me though. the lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. i guess i'm not going to get to work out today. it's already 12:45 and i still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. i wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine? to me, i wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. damn my typing needs work. i used to be a great typist, now i have to backspace a million times to get it right. it's terribly annoying. i think after i'm done with this i might sign up for my experiments for this class. i did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than i expected. my arms and hands are getting tired of typing. i can't wait until this is over. only 48 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. she always slams the door. i really need to clean my room and i guess i will in about 5 seconds. okay well bye for now. i'm not going to finish my writing now that my 20 min. are up. i've got lots of other things to do today. bye ",0,-1.10328 -0.010697 0.585338 0.085811 -0.318458 1.534292 -0.762 -0.811888 -0.450515 1.579305 -0.207672 -0.444056 -1.000037 0.131111 -0.526628 0.0 -0.04277 0.393105 0.398529 1.276744 0.764296 -0.598565 0.011447 -0.107098 0.042806 -0.266357 0.229323 0.939282 -1.037571 -1.416177 -0.664037 -0.578844 0.05047 -0.64803 0.736163 -0.177295 -1.375825 -0.408359 -0.848073 -0.737442 0.019438 -0.141341 -1.002297 0.853871 0.563724 0.759934 -0.335938 -0.126734 0.849128 0.063372 -0.878534 1.807659 0.111736 0.57096 -0.252925 -0.946042 0.384928 -0.559961 0.15966 -1.194779 0.626006 -0.290531 -0.480161 -0.491314 -0.041785 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.700915 -0.424865 0.107193 -0.23436 -0.436665 -0.37208 0.062046 -0.422267 0.423497 0.679032 0.092234 0.299457 4.673664 4.121551 4.572015 4.838554 4.362121,1539

i was born in alice. if your thinking this is like a biography, then i think that you will be wrong. however, back to what i was saying. i don't really like traveling to alice, tx. i find it kind of boring because i don't have anyone over there that is my age. all of my relatives are much older than i. these people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. lets talk about my uncle for instance. i will not mention his name, however, he was. i mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. why would i be interested in going and visiting him unless i wanted some crack or something? he is a liar anyways, and i don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. speaking of the kind of people i affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, i think that i accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. however, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, i think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. anyways, i'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. lets talk about my big brother. now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. this is the reason that i look up to him. he knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all a's! i have to admit that i am somewhat jealous. however, he does help me out and gives really great advice. when he tutors me, i feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how i retain material. he is two years older than me, but i am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that i feel is so precious to a person. i hated not being respected. it made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and i couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. however, i put an end to all that crap when i joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. i learned how to fight the hard way though. my coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so i just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. i adopted a slugger's style of fighting. the reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. my strength began to get developed when i began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. that year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so i took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. from then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. i didn't even have to fight anymore! but i kept on because i got too competitive and i kind of liked it. currently, i'm undefeated in my hometown. however, i was just an average fighter when it came to the golden gloves. i stopped when i started college. that's enough of that. my father is the next person i want to discuss. he has worked his way from rock bottom, and i admire that. he slept in a car for 6 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called southern pacific). he helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). i still love her and all, i just don't agree with anything she does. she seems to have tunnel vision, u know what i mean? let me explain because my time here is almost up. she is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. today she seems more like a stranger, cause i don't see her all that much. she didn't invite me to her wedding. my time is up. talk to u later. bye ",1,0.550944 0.092728 -0.311216 0.16128 -0.069755 -0.794736 0.824015 0.91211 1.11123 0.753815 -0.154424 0.126864 -0.242931 0.38235 0.951803 0.0 -0.04277 1.00414 0.097289 0.129807 0.137604 -0.382778 1.997701 -0.658316 -0.20717 0.056531 0.437746 -0.440101 -0.107483 -0.873872 -0.009494 -1.164566 0.814656 -0.906028 3.149038 -0.818 -0.853062 1.962381 -0.083878 -1.46311 -0.597723 -0.35628 0.59221 0.510574 0.314967 1.130607 -0.383122 2.240061 3.350308 1.624074 1.191064 0.047726 0.271722 -1.187078 -0.384218 0.323189 0.803728 0.0317 0.363829 0.836838 -1.095683 -0.430577 -0.480161 0.207094 0.716079 0.727924 -0.086094 -0.215479 0.761451 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.034167 -0.081487 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.432135 2.375545 0.42643 0.058924 4.755241 3.895505 4.16236 4.548415 4.960577,2213
"by back hurts when i sit like this and i can feel the little tendon that is inflamed. i don't really have to think about each letter that i type on the keyboard i just think about what i want to say and it goes from my mind through the fingers and into the computer. i just stopped to think about what to write about next but i don't know exactly what i'm thinking so i'll write about what i just thought. my mind is telling me that it is lunch time and my stomach is agreeing. i think that i am going to eat healthy today because i have been slacking off pretty bad. i should probably eat some of the food that my parents gave me this weekend so that my roommate doesn't eat it all. gosh my back hurts. damn rain. houston has a lot of rain, probably more than austin i think i like usstin a lot better than houston, it is cooler here to there is not nearly as much humidity, gosh i have a bad cough, why do i get depressed so easily i think my problem is that i am always trying to please everybody else and not myself. i guess that is good because it is unselfish but it is my life and everybody says that life is short but see there i go listening to everybody else again. goodness i have a cough a headache and my back is so screwed up , it sucks to go from being very active to nearly useless . my whole life has been about having fun and playing sports and now it hurts to bad just sitting here. it is amazing that i was not paralyzed, i could not imagine what it must feel like to know that you will never stand up strait or run or even walk again. that suck but i see now that my situation is not as bad as many peoples. what do i write now i wonder. i wonder how many people will be on sixth street i wonder why my nose is itching and i haven't stopped typing to scratch it . it must be a zit trying to emerge. janel if you read this you probably think that last statement is gross but i am very frank. i wonder if i am going to do good here at ut. i wonder what song that is being played down the hall so loud. i wonder if that is. oh well the reptilian part of my brain is telling me that i have written for twenty minutes and that i should do something else.

"i already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. unfortunately, when i tried to submit it, it didn't work. there was some sort of error and now i am having to redo the entire thing. so basically, i simply feel frustrated that i have to redo this assignment when i could be using my time for something much more useful than this. beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. i am currently trying to decide what i am going to do with the rest of my life. i feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! my decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. my career choice will determine what kind of people i meet and what kind of contribution i make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. it is important to me that i make a good decision. for this reason, i feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. i want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. i suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. after all, isn't the most important thing that i am satisfied with my job? the opinions of others shouldn't influence me. and yet, i want people to think that i am intelligent. i can't help it. that is just the way i am. perhaps i have a bit more of peter keating and a bit less of howard roark in my than i would like. another important factor is the value of my work. i would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. for example if i were a microbiologist, i could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. another important factor is money. i would like to say that money isn't important. however, this is a lie. i want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. i want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. i want to be able to go on vacations every year. i want to see the world. of course i need someone to have fun with while i do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if i went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. the underlying point here is that i want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. if these were the only criteria, i think i could find a job fairly easily. the real clincher is the next criterion. i want to enjoy my job. i know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. however, i don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that i am going to hate. i don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. i don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. i am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so i want to make sure i enjoy it. not only do i want to enjoy it, i want to make sure i choose the career that i will enjoy the most. perhaps this is the reason that i find it so difficult to make a career decision. i feel as though i am currently being productive in my career quest. i added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if i might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. if not, i have determined that i should remain in the college of natural science because that is where i will find a courseload that interests me the most. surely if i choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary.

"well, here it goes. i don't know exactly what to write about because my mind is sort of blank to real thoughts as i've been studying all day. but i'll start with what is the most important thing to me right now--loneliness. what better thing to write about when you're listening to bruce springsteen. anyway, it's not the clinical loneliness from which i suffer. it's more of a deprivation i guess. it's a deprivation of emotional intimacy. you see, i have quite a few male friends which is great because male bonding is always a must. but i'm the type of guy who always needs a deep relationship with a girl. it gives me a sort of basis in my life. everything falls into place. i do better academically if i'm in love with a girl and i am more confident about everything i do. i am so much happier when i'm in love. basically, when comes down to it, i love being in love. how do i know? well, i've been there before. i fell deeply in love with a girl in my junior year of high school. yeah, yeah, i know ""you were too young to know what love was. "" i really wasn't. there's a van halen song which says ""how do i know when it's love? i can't tell ya' but it lasts forever. how does it feel when it's love? it's just something you feel together. ' well, i completely relate to the togetherness part and lately i've come to realize that i can also relate to the foreverness part, too. there will always be a place in my heart for shannon. but she isn't the point. she is what was. and life isn't what was, it's what's going to be. all i'm saying is that i know what love is and how to love. i want it back . but it's so hard up here at ut to find it, or so it seems. i should be able to find it because i'm pretty good-looking and i've really turned into a nice person. but every girl that catches my seems so unapproachable. but, there's another factor in this whole game. i'm already in love. i'm in love with someone who lives back in the woodlands. i had a crush on this girl since my sophomore year and somehow we developed a friendship where both of us went through some peculiar twists. you see, we know we both liked each other and we both wanted to do something about it but we didn't. i didn't because i felt that if i told how i really felt, she wouldn't understand and run away from me(metaphorically). she didn't do it because i don't think she knew what she was feeling. she's never been there before so she's not familiar with the symptoms. it took me a while to figure mine out with shannon, but when it happened, i knew the second it hit me. i think it's hit her but she doesn't know what to do. well, my twenty minutes is up so i'm gonna' cruise. but i might actually get on here on do this out of pure enjoyment. you see, i always do this. i always sit down and throw up all this junk onto paper and then sift through the vomit afterwards. it helps when you're stressed. anyway, thanks for listening, and if no one ever reads this i do think bert from sesame street is evil. if you don't believe, get on the net and find the bert is evil website and see for yourself!!!!!!!!!

"my thoughts, feelings, and sensations? right now? my eyes feel vacant, my heart feels heavy. at the moment? now, in my dorm, in the silence of others and the sound only of ani's enlightening lyrics via stereo, i cannot hide behind the facade of a smile. there is no need to. unless i should be concerned with impressing a professor of some sort with a great stream of consiousness piece of writing. this is my consiousness, and i suppose it really isn't so interesting. i am worried, that is one sensation ripping through my veins. i am worried i will fail french, (how can you teach someone a new language in that language?) i don't understand. i am worried about things that cannot be voiced anywhere. i am worried about things you are not supposed to talk about. not to strangers. not to family. not to friends, unless they don't mind the burden. ""god help you if you are an ugly girl, course too pretty is also your doom"" as ani says. i know what she means; i have felt both ways, too often. i will choose the ugly girl, though. she has the better deal. she doesn't have to be afraid. i never fully understood the truth to this until i came here, to austin, to college. i didnt realize what a risk it is to be a ""pretty girl. "" this is taking a strange turn, sorry, i havent quite figured out how to regulate my stream of consiousness. but this is what i think about. does he think i'm pretty? god, i hope not. oh, please let someone else get in the elevator with us, don't leave me alone with him. how fast can i run if he approaches me. these are now everyday thoughts for me. i never used to be like this. i am ashamed of the girl i have become in the last week. i have discovered several things about myself since last tuesday. i am not, in any sense, the righteous babe (an ani term) i thought i was. i am a scared little girl. i cannot stand up to those who hurt me; i have proven that this week. in lieu of retaliation and justice, i cower in the shadows, i cling to my boyfriend, i cry myself to sleep. my mind is full of thoughts, so many i can't sort them all. so only the prominant ones come through to the screen. i apologize that they can't be the happy ones, the ones that say how much i love college, life, and my psychology class. i am not worthy of so many things, i think maybe my hypothalamus doesn't secrete enough of that happy stuff. my feelings are not so great at the moment; perhaps i should have chosen to write this some other time. i am so naive and stupid. those are my thoughts. that i allowed this horror to happen to me, to my boyfriend; that i am doing nothing about it. that i am writing about it here for someone i have never spoken to to read it. i miss my little brother. my baby four year old brother. he is my favorite person in the entire world. i am looking at a picture of him now, holding a wooden sword, pretending to be either david crockett or obi wan kenobi. welp, my twenty minutes are up. thank you, doctor.

"i need to write this paper for psychology to get a good grade in the class. this assignment is much easier than some of the other assignments i have gotten in my other classes. but, then again, my other classes aren't necessarily hard. i mean, in history of rock music, i have to go see a concert and report on it. how cool is that?! i wish i could go to a coldplay concert. i would love to go to a coldplay concert. i like their music. i like the beatles too. i'm listening to a beatles song right now. i believe paul wrote michelle"". i went to the paul mccartney concert last october. it was totally amazing. i wish i could go again. i saved my ticket stub and put it in a box that i store all the important little trinkets i want to keep. i put all my concert tickets in there. i really need good grades in order to get into the rtf school. i really want to become a film maker. i would love to become the next jerry bruckheimer. producing seems really cool, but really hard. i would love to direct, but directing seems like one of the most impossible jobs to do successfully. i would love to one day be a well known and respected film maker. i love old films. last sunday, the state theater on congress showed gone with the wind. i went to the movie instead of the ut football game. i don't like football as much as i like old movies. it was so worth it. to see one of my favorite movies of all time on the big screen was amazing. i walked to the theater, and i decided to take the bus back. only, i was not aware that the busses have different route on game days. i got on the number 7 bus and ended up around highland mall. it turned out okay though, because the bus circles the mall and comes back towards campus. i got off the bus on dean keaton street and had to walk back to my dorm in jester in the rain. the movie was still worth it. dean keaton. that's also the name of the main character in the movie: the usual suspects. that is a good movie. for the longest time, i hadn't seen it, but then my brother kept telling me that i shouldn't see it because it is excellent. well, during move-in a couple of weeks ago, when everybody was in a frenzy, i just hung out for a couple of days at my brother's house. while there, i got a chance to see the usual suspects. what a great film. the ending was amazing, even though someone had already told me how it ended. i was surprised all the same. ah! people keep instant messaging me while i am trying to do this essay. i'm going to put up an away message so they will leave me alone for a while. my mother called me this afternoon to tell me that the product i ordered online came in the mail. i need to go pick it up. it was my first order on ebay. a friend of mine and i really like david beckham, so i found some england national team jerseys with his name on the back online for only $10 a piece. we have been waiting about 2 weeks for them to come in the mail, but i guess that isn't that long considering they were being shipped from thailand. i hope they are in good condition. i mean, for $10, one would assume they are in total disarray. i hope not. i really want a beckham jersey. wow, i am really writing about absolutely nothing. this assignment is awesome! now i'm listening to a dave matthews band song. ""the song that jane likes"". i just started liking dmb only about 2 years ago. my best friend idolizes them and plays all their songs on his guitar. gabe is an awesome guitar player. i wish he was with me here at ut. i really miss him. he is back at home, while everyone else we know moved on to college. i feel bad for him. i wish he would move to austin with me. he works at starbucks and is trying to raise enough money for him to go to school. i love starbucks. i used to always get a caramel macchiato, but now i really like irish cream cafe mochas. those are very good. i have not really had any time to go to starbucks. there's one in the bottom floor of jester center, but its just not the same as an actual cafe house. gabe and i would regularly hang out at the starbucks by us for hours on end. we would talk or play cards or chess. i really miss that. its okay though, he is coming to visit soon, and i will be going home for his birthday in a couple of weeks. it should be fun. i'm really excited about that.

"i finally got all of my ethernet problems worked out today, so i e-mailed everyone i know. i wish my mom would call so i could tell her that not only did i get the package with my windows 95 disk but i also received my nabisco care package. it had all kinds of goodies in it but i haven't yet gotten to eat any of them yet. i wonder where scott is. i haven't heard from him since monday i think. he's probably at work, or playing magic with tim and anthony. i'm glad i got a card from julie today, looks like she's having a good time at ou. maybe i'll call her before i go to the red river shoot-out in dallas, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in dallas and i could stay with her. i wish the guys working outside would be quiet. and for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. my fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so i guess i'll live. i'm so excited! i get to go to my first ut football game on saturday. but i also get to go to all of the other home football games because i got season tickets. maybe i'll see my aggie friends at the a&m game november, kristine doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise i'd write her. i don't think i get to go home again until september the twentieth, but maybe i'll get to see scott then, unless he comes here, but i don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if i keep going back and forth i hope that i'm getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. i need to start planning my week like i learned how at the time management and study strategies seminar i went to on sunday i think i need to take a nap. i wish i had some nail polish remover, i need to repaint my toenails. i wonder if i can make it through three weeks before i need to get my nails redone. i hope so i don't want to change manicurists, i like vicky.

". it's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. currently i'm ecstatic because i just found out that my soccer team may be going to clemson college and that is where my best friend, kristen mckinney is going to school. i miss her so much! when i think of her i never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that god brought her into my life. with my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend i have ever had. i had so much trust in her, that many times i found myself dependent on her when i needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. i remember a time when i was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how i felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. immediately after i left i drove two blocks to kristen's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. people say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but i know that the friendship kristen and i have can't get much more intimate than ours. through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. that's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. although i miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because i am confident that god has prosperous plans for me at ut and kristen at clemson. also this will each me to become completely dependent on christ and his promises and not on fleeting things of this world. i really hope that i will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. already i find myself not making time to be in the word, which is the armor i need to remain strong against the enemy. i can relate with paul who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. but glory be to god who makes me free of guilt through jesus. why he chose me, i have no idea. my mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny chris farly lines or petty worries of the day. already i am thinking of other assignments i need to complete after this and of how i need to get in touch with certain people. yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to god, and i have such trouble letting christ shine out of me when i am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. lord, please make me a bondservant to serve you daily on this campus or where ever i am and who ever i run into.

"my life is an out of control freight train. i know not where i am going or how i am going to get there. throw a match upon me and i could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. but for what reason do you do this? i hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that i pass the question. why am i all of the sudden asking myself why? i know where i came from but does this mean i cannot know where i am going? on i travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. this gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. this is why i am grateful that i do not have to face the world alone. my life is full of love and hope. my hopes of myself are to touch some person the way i have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. this ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and i can see through your blurry sight. and i can see through you! your rules mean nothing to me and mine. i live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. i draw so much upon my music that i sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. my life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings.

"this the third time that i am typing this thing. i am so frustrated. every time i get close to the 20 minutes i get cut off. there is a party i want to go to now i am here stuck here spending an hour doing this thing. i don't know what to type because i am tired of staring at this screen. it seems as if in the past two weeks i have had no time to myself. between pledgship, school, and studying, i have no time. the only time i spend in my room, is done sleeping. i am just going to describe what is going on in sportscenter because i haven't watched it in about a week. chris berman is talking about the upcoming pro football games this weekend. i used to idolize berman. i also liked dick vitale. i was so obsessed that i wrote him a letter. a few weeks later i got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside. i am halfway done! i am starting to calm down. i have never been to hot-headed. i try to keep a level head all the time. the only time i really cut loose is when i am in a competition that i feel i can win. this may not be very often but when it does happen i thrive on the situation. only eight minutes left. i really respect pudge rodriguez. he is the catcher for the rangers, my hometown team. i also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. mo vaughn is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. i like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. i hope to get good grades. i wish this assignment was over. i love college football. i loved to play football but i never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level i wanted to . i hate danny schayes. his dad was a great basketball player. one minute left!! my favorite team is the cowboys. i love going to the games and cheering them on to victory. i think my time is up so i will write later! the simpsons is the best show on tv by the way. and caddyshack is the bast movie ever!

"today was a pretty calm day. nothing outrageous happened. right now i feel hungry, probably because the last time i ate was at 6:50 or so and i didn't have much. i tired this new stir fry stuff and some mashed potatoes. it was ok but i guess it was only filling for the time being. i almost forgot i had this assignment due tomorrow. i sprang out of bed as soon as i remembered. earlier my suite mates and i watched a movie at the union called mean girls. it was good and they showed it for free too so there were a lot of people there. they show a lot of movies at the union. the next dorm family event planned for us is to go and watch the movie troy. my roommate's friend is going to make her and i watch the movie schindler's list sometime soon. he is a big movie fan and is going into the college of communication and he wants to be a director later on. he has already made a movie. he made it in high school and he went around and just videotaped the different events and people at school. my roommate said it was good. she just told me that her chemistry professor wrote the book they use in class. its not just him but he has contributed to writing the book. he has his name on the cover of the book and everything. i'm going home to houston next weekend to see my family and to attend this bayou bhangra competition that all my friends are going to. its going to be really fun. i can't wait to see my baby sister she's just too cute for me. i love her and she's a miracle baby too especially because she serviced through my mom's accident and all the medication my mom had to take during her pregnancy. but i guess that's god's love and blessing and i am very thankful for everything he as done for me and my family but i don't know what to think of him after my aunt and uncle's freak accident and death. i don't understand why he sends us these extraordinary people and then just takes them away from us before its time for them to go. i don't know i suppose its just one of those things that happen and can't be explained. and i believe that things happen for a reason but i don't know how god can justify their death and all these things that have been happening to our entire family. things haven't seem to be right ever since my grandmother passed away. well that's all i can think of to write about and its time now too, how convenient. bye ",1,0.666112 0.218633 -1.086034 0.516423 -0.713442 1.110423 0.33997 1.021447 0.700345 -0.722979 -0.130702 -0.590446 0.732969 0.769169 -0.137619 0.0 -0.04277 0.371438 -1.083594 0.544956 -0.996524 -0.742368 2.157889 -1.12687 0.130843 0.281111 -0.35517 -0.493016 -1.260849 -0.226872 0.381108 -0.948626 -1.572356 -0.906028 -0.62082 -1.109326 -1.061668 0.873289 -0.20899 -1.476369 -0.240153 -0.144437 -0.346497 0.342471 1.729428 -0.425552 -0.664708 2.02215 -0.30818 1.7465 0.774211 0.329782 1.056159 -1.068809 -0.210793 -1.325379 -0.987853 -0.954251 1.327222 -0.656411 1.117632 -1.176565 1.414852 0.979226 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.275271 -1.161955 0.131071 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.575497 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.740255 5.093989 3.215832 5.359631 4.924947 4.731686,2447
" i am a little worried about this asignment because i don't type very fast, but i guess this is giving me good practice. i don't know if i should go run before dinner or take the excerisese class that is after dinner. i need to do something because i will get into the pattern of not working out,and then i will gain the freshman 15 like very one says you do. there is just so many other things that i need to be doing. but i know that i feel better if i work out. if i gain weight i will get depresed and i won't want to do anything. i can't believe jason is so wraped up in working out. i am supposed to be the one worried about my figure. ana has lost weigh too. how does she stay so motivated, and excited about runing. i would go take that class, but i have never done kick boxing, and i will problay look very stuiped. there are girls that just never shut up in this dorm. and some that always have the perfect hair and make up. that just seems so high school to me. i am excited about the chrisitan soriety. i hope i can find some girls that i like to hang around with. surley their will be a couple that i will enjoy being around. i hope i enjoy the pledge retreat on friday. i bet we will be up all night. that means that i will probably be sick again. ana is coming down on saterday, and i hope that amy will come to. amy has grown up so much in the last couple of months. i can't believe that she is being exposed to all of the jenkins trama with jims affairs. that is just a burden that she should not have to have. i know i think about it all the time and i did not have to listen to it as much as she did. it just amazes me how he could have done that. i wonder if he has some kind of mental problem. it would not surprise me, look at his dad. i just hope graham is not like his dad. surley ana would know if he was. at least i hope she would know, for her sake. i think it is funny how pam all the sudden likes to cook now. she is in her late fortys and is just now learning how to cook. thats sad. i am glad that i grew up in a family who cooks, and eats dinner together at night. or at least we did when we were little. not all the time now that everyones off to college. it was so wird going home this weekend, it was almost like i had to get used to it again. it has felt so far away for the past three weeks. i don't want to go home too much. i want mom and dad to get the feeling that im gone, and so then when i come home it is special. jason made me mad this weedend, becuause he did not come and visit with my parents. i took time out of my schedule to come and visit his parents. his parents seemed weird this weekend also, i wonder what was up. page seemed like she was jelouse that they were having to buy jason some new cloths. that is so rediculous. she is a grown woman that can act like a small child some times. she can be very stingy. i can't believe that jasons parents don't support him very much, i guess i am just used to having the best dad in the world ",0,-0.68825 -0.443984 0.248981 -0.232546 -0.084608 0.384809 -1.254055 -0.604109 -1.558148 -0.154981 -0.180061 -0.590446 -0.406916 1.239541 -1.261147 0.0 -0.04277 -0.254103 -0.531891 -0.029157 -0.569039 -0.494188 0.8714 0.60708 -0.624052 -0.675407 0.020551 -0.484722 0.09621 0.904391 0.405367 1.142466 -0.828253 -0.015506 -0.715227 -0.305062 0.242244 -0.079612 0.520995 0.843546 -1.038726 1.522063 1.340855 -1.0718 -0.741529 -0.974956 -0.112935 0.202299 -0.89709 0.44567 -0.269021 0.162723 0.741297 1.083665 1.706198 0.61203 0.762634 0.406705 -0.065285 1.145438 0.623866 0.660021 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.277534 -0.283387 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.912471 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.590466 5.236633 4.060441 4.810758 4.861636 4.248545,1788

"am not in the best of moods right now. i have something bothering me at this time. but i take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. i am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside. however, life goes on. am good now, or at least not feeling so down. this is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. sounds really bad, but i console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others. at this very moment am listening to music while typing. i really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. and it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. if you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. i always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow. i decided to do my assignment now, because i was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time i will have. so if i don't do it now, i`ll probably not have sufficient time. guess what! life in college is very stressing, so i always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. i always thought that i was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. but hey, life must go on, so i am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress. i like my life right now, i really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, i know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what i am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life. i don`t type that very well, so there will be i hope not too many errors. life is one of the best things we have. we can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a good impact.

"excersise really does work. it does release happy chemicals. i feel reasonably energized now. but at the same time, i feel like it already peaked. its wearing off. jealousy is funny. chris and harvey met three girls while i was gone. i feel left out. i have a girlfriend, and i love her more than anything. i miss her. id give anything for one of her hugs now. but perhaps just the fact that they are meeting people and i am not is making me jealous. but. if they had met some guy, i don't think i'd be very jealous. its girls. i like girls. girls make good friends. i seem to have more close female friends than most with girlfriends do. i always thought this was a good thing, but lately, given my reaction to this new college environment im begginning to wonder if it is. im begginning to wonder whether i just want to meet girls, and have the romantic tension that will never amount to anything more. the romantic tension makes me feel good about myself. shouldnt my girlfriend make me feel good about myself? she does. but i always want more. it's impossible to do this assignment without sort of planning it out. i want music now. i still feel jealous. but while writing about it, some of it has subsided. i feel guilty for being so jealous of my close friends. in fact, my best friend. my roommate. i don't know if he considers me his best friend. it would flatter me more than anything to find out he did. if he ever told me. if i died, i wonder how many people would say their best friend died? i feel like im a best friend to many people. i feel guilty for this, because best friend usaually implies an exclusive position. now that i think back, there have been many instances where one of my friends would tell another friend that they were my best friend. i considered the friend they told my best friend. and i felt like i had done something wrong, like made the person who wasnt my best friend feel to close to me. i like close friendships, with anybody. i don't like going to parties. i like hanging out in small groups, or just talking to one person for a long time. i think i have made a lot more close friends this way than people that go to parties. i think a lot of people are jealous of me, because i manage to maintain intimate friendships with so many people. its odd how oblivious i am to this jealousy. im constantly insecure. i've questioned repeatedly how anybody could like me. i never want to meet anybody like me, i could see through them to everything i hate about myself. even as i tell myself now that people will jealous of me, im sure something will happen tonight that will make me forget that. when im jealous of someone, i don't understand how they could be jealous of me. i'm constantly jealous. for my freshman seminar on concepts of sin, we have to pick our own sin to write about. my sin will be envy. the one i can't control. other sins don't give me as much trouble. im a very restrained person. i think restraint and balance are more important than anything else. especially in love. i say that because i remember a word my teacher was talking about that meant to love your spouse too much. she said it used to be a sin, but its not anymore. it began with a j. i wish i could remember it. im sure ill look it up soon. its a word that relates to me a lot, and i bet i'll sound very smart when i use it. people will think im a very educated person who not only understands himself, but also uses big words to describe his self understanding. anyway, i agree that loving your spouse too much is a sin. my spouse type figure and me seem to have a mutual understanding about this. its odd how at times i love everything, and at other times i love nothing. i wonder if the aderall i take affects that. it seems to stimulate my emotions. sometimes when i take it late at night so that i can focus on studying, i start crying from pure emotion. heh, well, obviously not pure. harvey aays its okay to take because it was prescribed to me. i still think id feel better about myself if i wasnt on it. this band makes me feel better when im troubled. its odd, because theyre lyrics are very meaningless to me. but the music has this sleazy, yet upbeat sound that somehow taps into what im feeling. i wonder if they created this sound on purpose. i saw them live in austin, it was a fun show. i remember a drunk man who was extremely happy jumping up and down a lot and yelling right next to me. that was the first time i ever wondered if i should start drinking. i think i've still decided no.

"i don't have enough time in my day for important schoolwork, studying, work, rest time, and enough sleep to make me feel good. i haven't even left myself enough time on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays for lunch. what was i thinking making those work hours for myself. i gave myself 30 minutes to get to class. i have to wake up in the morning and work from 9 until whenever i get off to get to class in 30 minutes. that's no time to even stop and think or do an errand here and there. i had to go home this weekend to get a bunch of homework and studying done. i have one of the busiest weeks this week. everything seems to be due on the same day, but thankfully not the same hour. when can i sleep? i have to write four menus for four dinners of twenty people and write the ingredients list and have everything organized and typed. at least i can type and work here late at night. it is a getaway from my hot house and hot room. i should stay here all night one night. it's so cool and comfortable in here. i have to clean sometime today in between classes. the only reason i have time for anything now is because i didn't work today. i had to wake up with not enough sleep and i didn't even work today. i guess it's good though because i'm getting this and the pretesting done and that's important. i wonder if we get some sort of receipt for doing this like we are supposed to in the pretesting. i hope so it would be my luck that it doesn't get submitted. if someone is reading this, it was submitted. i wonder if anyone is actually reading this. it makes me so mad and frustrated with the mail system. it's always the really important letters and mail that gets lost. why did it have to be that letter that got lost? i have to go to some building to get my password for receiving email because i can't remember my password. i have to also pick up my financial aid check. maybe it's in the same building. i can't help correcting my errors as i type. it's a habit thing. my finger automatically goes to the delete key when i see an error. at least now i can what was i typing??? i think faster than i type and i type pretty fast, but as i type one thing i'm thinking of something else. it's weird to write down what you think. i don't usually think ""oh i'm thinking about this"" i just think. thought just go through my head. usually the thoughts that i really hear are the worried and stressed out thoughts because i know i'm slacking already and what is it like the 3rd week of school? has it been 20 minutes yet? when you watch the time, it goes so slow. maybe that's what i should do to savor my time. just watch it. if i could watch a clock as i sleep it would be perfect. my sleep time would be good and long. well it's been twenty minutes. it makes me feel good that i got this done. that's one thing on my long list of things to do. what if they don't like my menu for the week? it's too boring. the menu for this week has so my variety. oh i don't care. i have to stop thinking or i'll never stop writing.

" i'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. i keep asking myself whether or not i'm am going to make it in my major. my major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. my friends say they don't know what i got myself into, but i keep telling them i'll be fine to not worry about me. when i say this i am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that i will be fine. this library is all to silent i think i just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. while i'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not i am going to make an a on the chemistry exam on tuesday. i feel bombarded with chem and i don't know if i am going to be able to remember all three chapters. my mind keeps telling me that i will be fine that i just have to get used to it. high school was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. that hasnt been my problem lately the only problems i have had all are about having not enough time. every time i talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, i tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. i know older people had told me the same but i really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. oh yeah i am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. i feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. i feel like they all grasp the ideas that i don't. in high school i was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. maybe that's just me overthinking. i can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. it smells like a piece of chocolate. maybe it is a candybar of some sort. i don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. i am not a real big fan chocolate but i do love chocolate ice cream. something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. lately i have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. i miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. she is graduating a semester early from hs and is going to move to austin and attend acc for the remainder of the year. i offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. i hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. the man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing. he now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. all she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. she is one of the most ungrateful people i have ever encountered in my whole entire life. people who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but i see the real her everyday.

"right now it is 11:25. i am sitting by myself in the dorm at hardin house. it is raining very hard outside. earlier i went to target and bought a brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so i got home and then had to drive all the way back. i am from tulsa, oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. i love ut however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when i go out at night. i went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged theta. i am having so much fun and i love all of the girls in my sorority. my friends and i have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. when i walk in the room i don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. also since living in austin i have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. i have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. i have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example hula hut, shady grove, dirty's and much more. as i walk down the drag i notice that there is a large variety of people in austin. yesterday i had my first encounter with the infamous leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street. apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. also today when i went to einstein bagels i looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. college in austin is much different than my small private high school in tulsa. i never knew how sheltered we all were and i am so glad that i have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real"" world. right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. it is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. i live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. although there are many distractions at hardin house, i am so glad this is where i live. i have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50,000 plus people. sometimes it is, like when i walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. but then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. i have already found a group of people i ""hang out"" with everyday and i almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. i am so excited for the arkansas game this weekend. football is my favorite sport and i really hope the longhorns can beat ou this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. on tuesday i joined a group call tag, texas advertising group, because i am trying to transfer in to the communications college. i am a little nervous about that because i heard it was very difficult. i am currently in the liberal arts school as an english major. my classes seem to be going very well. i think after this paper i am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the sex and the city dvd with my friends because they are all avid watchers while i have never seen a single episode. i never really get hooked on a tv series. i always just watch the show when it comes out on video.

" i'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. i was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best i can do with how ready i am now. it's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, i've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. you'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. so much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. that which makes things most apparent is contrast. i could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if i drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then i'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which i don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. escher's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 2 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from geb, egb, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. with any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. the anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. but what is to name something? very far from actually understanding it. so we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. murphy and godel, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of murphy's law was true. i hope that makes sense to someone besides me. how can anyone ever trust words? they give us so little to go on. try describing an experience you had to someone else. they'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. the impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. i am the universe and i act in the universe. i can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. let's try some meditation. you hide, they seek. sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. this is as true now as it will be now. hahaha. oops. i don't know what it means. my ass hurts. i should shift or something. that's better. i think i forgot what i was supposed to be thinking about. don't take points off, please, haha. i still don't know what it means. any of it. i've done this type of thing before but the time i remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. the goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one i was handwriting and somehow, i still can't explain it, i just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd ",1,1.403032 -1.671586 -1.780642 -1.786808 -2.336629 -0.046257 2.270222 2.187075 2.463405 0.670509 -0.115895 -0.016598 0.727606 -2.718799 2.552155 0.0 -0.04277 -1.485131 -2.746123 0.533509 -2.753703 2.577801 -0.518488 -0.829797 -0.624052 1.360045 0.297444 0.052632 -1.32249 -0.711209 -0.820481 0.481698 -1.133867 -0.906028 -0.792961 -0.212699 -0.418424 -0.569698 -0.377086 -0.126539 0.318566 0.511323 -0.507205 0.317915 0.360172 0.777951 -0.364714 -0.017629 -0.449337 0.876302 -0.545814 -1.122432 -0.402517 -1.915128 -0.518906 -0.339229 -0.622125 0.562999 -0.390711 0.945482 -0.207675 0.559621 0.235584 -0.745201 0.100986 0.754052 -0.086094 -0.448057 2.710673 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.168739 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.945848 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.996197 4.389847 2.937096 4.526874 4.564004 5.884853,1623
"i am extremely tired having recently returned from classes. the bus ride wasn't as cramped as usual but just as long because of the heat, and because i had nothing to look at or it'd seem very much like i was staring at someone. not that it really matters though, but either way, i prefer looking at the 'view. ' anyways, i'm not much in the writing mood right now. i'm so used to just rambling on like in my journal entries only i tend to forget almost that i'm turning this in. well, actually, i haven't forgotten that because i am not getting personal with this. which reminds me, i haven't written anything in a while. i mean, anything all together, not just journal entries and such. did i ever tell you how i started writing in a journal? first, let me note that i call it a journal, not a diary because it sounds much too feminine and prissy. a silly thought, i know, but that just shows how immature i was when i first started. that also reflects another aspect of the way my family is, but i won't go there. it's too complicated and no one will ever be able to figure it out. really, my family and i are all about each other. people who know any or all of us may find that odd especially if they aren't so content with their family or at least at the moment. but, like i said, completely different, controversial, complex topic. i'll just end up talking myself in circles again. but like i was saying, my first journal was from mrs. stevens, my seventh grade english teacher who i used to help sometimes in the mornings when we actually got to school early enough for me to have time to assist her. i was her teacher aide, which was something that junior honor society students got to do. it (the honor society and everything else involved with junior high) really is petty, among other generally negative things. well, let me type faster so that i can finish this lame, boring story. well, at the end of the year, as is customary, we exchanged presents once again. i of course was broke as usual so i think i ended up giving her some flowers that i got from my aunt's wedding the weekend before. hey, i think i did that with my secret teacher too. yup. anyways, she (mrs. stevens) gave me a journal because of the one almost actual conversation that we had (i wasn't very good at being social then, if you can't tell). we had talked about writing and i mentioned how i thought that it would be awesome to actually write a book someday, something great that i can sit back and just stare at knowing that i put all those words together, i wrote all of that. i don't know, i like to see good effects of hard labor. you know, the finished product. i guess that's why i enjoy writing, drawing, coloring, making things, and putting things together. oh, and reading too of course. anyways, back to my story again. well, i also mentioned how i thought it was neat how one of my friends, vicky walsh, who had just moved to this school from the northeast, had written a sort of book that told you how to draw horses. the plan was that she would write and draw the pictures and another girl whom she later became better friends with in high school, lindsey day, would type it and get paid for that. well, mrs. stevens gave me the journal at our last morning together and told me that this could be my start. in fact, she wrote inside something cliche like, ""just think, one of these days when you write your book, i can say that you used to be my student. "" except, it didn't sound so cliche as that when i read the inscription. she also said how she had always regretted not keeping a journal especially now. then, i was just happy that i received a present, a pretty yellow one with stripes on it. yes, i was a very selfish and greedy person. needless to say, i did start writing in that journal. in fact, my journal collection has grown to about four or five maybe. i'm really not sure. i stopped writing for a long time then i started again. i've been too busy and lazy to write lately, which always makes me feel guilty for some reason. i guess i am really grateful to her for that first journal though. i wonder if either of us realizes what kind of a difference that has made for me, especially during the hard times i guess. time is up now. i'll write more later. bye bye.

"as i am told to write this assignment, i begin my forced thinking by trying to find the correct ideas to write in this paper, instead of thinking whatever i want to in an incomplete and disordered way as i have been used to since i got out of school three months ago. so it's very difficult right nom, and you will notice that i constantly get distracted and start babbling incoherently. i'll try to write this paper very spontaneously so you get the right picture; but be warned. right before looking at the incredibly outstanding webpage (yeah right!) for my psy class, i was thinking where else could i surf the web, or if i should go to the pool here at my pearl st. co-op, or if i should start reading a bit, which is a definite no. i mean, it's friday!, or if i should write to my parents down in mexico city, etc, etc. so basically, i was evaluating everything i could possibly do in this boring friday afternoon, when what i really anted to do was nothing. but i've had exactly three months of that since school in mexico ended the 25th of may; and i immediately decided to do something productive which is this. i guess my mind is still warming up from all that time of null intellectual activity, and i'll get right back on track again. to tell you the truth, i think i am ready to start doing everything the right way, and not to procrastinate, which has been a big problem since i was born (i guess) or maybe it was because of my upbringing, or just because of the culture which i am a part of. as you may notice, i read chapter one yesterday and i can certainly notice a change in how i view things in my life and the life of others. in other words, i am starting to think in a psychological perspective already! the 20 minutes are over, and i can say that for a moment there, i was really concentrated and just writing all of this. but just as i noticed that the time was up, i started to wonder into something else again. i think that it was probably because my attention span is a bit short, but i know i'll get better. thanks for taking a little swim into my spontaneous and disordered thoughts and i hope i was not that boring. now i guess i've done my productive ""thing"" for today, and i can take a swim into the pool right in front of me! or maybe not. we'll see what my mind tells me later.

"it seems weird that linda is in the same philosophy class as me since we both live in the same neighborhood back in houston, even though we have never really met each tother before. she says she is planning to bvisit houston quite often, but i don;t think i will as often as her. its not because i don't want to go home, but its partly that i feel independent here even though not monetarily. also, i would like to get the chance to vistit austin and get to know m y surrounding before going back to the norm and comfortableness of my true home; austin is my new temporary home. mike said he missed home the very first day; i don;t think i really miss home that much, maybe because of the contradictory or hyppocritical views i sometimes have of things in houston. i wonder if my schedule conflict involving ba101 will be settled with out further conflict; i can't afford to miss psychology atfor ba101 once a month, yet i cannot afford to lose sight of ba101. hopefully, this dan or brian character will be able to sufficinetly change my course schedule since tex won't allow me to do it any more. it seems that i got a lot to do today, yet at the moment it doens't seem as anything is concrete, expect some homework arbitrarily. its only been 5 minutes and its seems as though i have been typing at leat twice that long. i wonder how my mind will wonder to the next stream of unconsciousness. philosophy seems to be an interesting class even though the reading is quite strenuous. socrates must have been the master at breaking people's arguments; he would have been a great attorney or lawyer. which reminds me, what exactly is the difference between a lawyer and an attorney? perhaps its in how they represent people or their specific type or level of education concerning the law. the damn ethernet guy better at least give me a ring and try to help me fix the connection that was working until last thursday or so, i have called and left a message three times already and no response. does he live in dobie or just has a similar prefix to his phone #. once i get the ethernet working, i won't have to come here to this computer lab and worrying abut forgetting to tyupe in my if account #. almost all the peoplke i have talked ot about this labor day weekend have said they will be travelling back to home; most of my friends are those from my high school, we probably are at least 55 people representing cy falls. i would like to play a pick up game with gabe and see how much he has improved since the days he was with theh cypress falls basketball program. i bet jimmy is trying to get accustomed to his new surroundings at that junior college, which i can't recall the name to. mike's sister basically got the dusch from that jeff punk, i don';t think i would have confessed seeing another woman unless she was going to find out regardless; better from me than from a stranger. unlike the infamous zoi situation, only five more minutes until i can check my mail; hopefully, somebody that is not attending ut will have written me to see how everything is going or the panhellenic council will have finally decided to start their opening meeting. how many greeks, true greeks' hellenas , not fraternity or soririty people, are amognst me at ut. maybe i will meet some good looking girls. i knew it was candice as soon as i saw at the bic meeting; haven't seen her since the days at tghp. its weird that she knows amber, the girl i kind of hooked up with at one fo the turkeyballs in 95, so long ago. its alomsst time and i just read the click once to submit button while awaiting the time to log off this thing. only a few more minutes ; my wrist are beginning to sweat opn this uncomfortable keyboard. i keep wanting to type with my left ring finger because it feels liek it needs to be streched or so. time.

"i just got finished with my spanish homework and now i can think in english. i don't really care for spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language. before that i was writing email to friends of mine at other schools. it is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them. if i didn't have email i probably wouldn't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive. i just found out that one of my friend's friend is quitting school. i don't understand that. giving up an education seems ridiculous to me. gold fishes are also ridiculous. my neighbor has oh wait, had two goldfish. one of them died last night. gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish. one minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a pepsi commercial. i now have been writing for five minutes and i wish i could stop looking at the clock. i took a computer assisted english class last semester and i am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience. one of my projects last semester had to do with the tick. he is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures, or nightmares, into the inner workings of his mind, he also has antenna which are referred to as those ""things"" on the cartoon by his cohorts. my little sister likes the tick as well but i don't think she understands alot the humor in it, most of its pretty stupid i will admit. my sister just learned how to say her abc's in spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone. the way she says ""w"" is really cute. my brother just got married this past summer and i don't know what to think of his wife, she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange. but i am not really a judge of strange since i have been called that myself a time or two. actually i think everyone is called strange, or weird, at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing. like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend, when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card, or package of candy. ten minutes. it is amazing how often people look at the clock. my batteries went dead awhile back and i don't really miss it very much, granted i took my sister's mickey mouse watch every now and then, in fact i think it is my room right now, but time often feels insistent and that can be stressful. kind of like how i have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment. my calf muscles are incredibly sore and i have been complaining about them all day. my roommate said that i shouldn't complain because i was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday. well i was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much, if i had know that this was how i was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice. 15 minutes. the mtv movie awards are on tonight and i don't know if i really want to watch them or not. its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are, i get enough of that with going to school here, just kidding. i will probably watch it anyway. my neighbors are pretty cool, even the one with minus on fish. i sure hope it didn't die because she didn't feed it, or over fed it. i don't see the purpose of a goldfish, i like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish, even though that is disgusting. i just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla, but now it is bob. what ever happened to quesadilla i will never know. i guess my dad and mom just couldn't hang with a name that made no sense. well it made sense to me, because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant, and they have the best quesadillas there. 20 minutes.

"i really want to go take a nap but i can't because i have so much work to do. that's how it's been since rush started. rush was when i really started feeling like my life was going through some changes that i didn't know if i could handle. now that's it's over and now that school is underway, the stress doesn't seem to be going anywhere. i always heard that college would be super stressful but never realized that what people were referring too wasn't necessarily just the school work. i thought i was so prepared to come to ut, and i guess based on my high school education i am, but i was not ready for trying to mix sorority and social life (one in which they expect you to go out every night) with school and my goal of a 4. 0. now, for one of the first times, it feels like i'm not going to be able to reach my goal. i am so worried about it. i already know what i want to do with my life, and that just makes it more stressful, because i know what i need to do to get there. oh well. i don't know what to do about trey. he is my boyfriend, or actually we're on a break because he wants me to feel no extra pressure of feeling like i owe him time while i figure out ut and while i get situated with everything. i didn't know someone could care about me the way he does. and its so weird now because we always knew it would come to this and it just never seemed like it would matter. i guess nobody really knows what to expect. i spend more of my time helping other people and trying to make everyone in the world happy, that a lot of times i forget that my happiness is important too. i guess that's why me not feeling the need to make time for trey has been good for me. it gives me less stress, but it feels like more is missing than just him. in everything i do i put my everything into it. so just knowing that i am missing opportunities to make him happy and even to make my parents happy by taking time to go have lunch with them, is tearing me up. this week my goal is to try to squeeze in school work and stuff, but also i am going to go to every social thing this week. i really want to make sure i give this sorority thing time to show why everyone who is in it, is so in love with it. my mom is real pushy about it. and my brother. i don't think anyone in my family realizes that my brother and i are two different people. i am not a partier, but we'll see i guess. i just really want to get good grades so i can choose where i want to go to medical school. my brother had to go to law school in lubbock because he didn't get in to ut's. he was upset. i want to dictate my own future and where i want to go. i just took that pretesting survey a few minutes ago and i thought it was interesting the variety of questions they asked. i have a huge fear that someone is in the backseat of my car all the time. well, only at night, like when i get in it after i've been inside or at someone else's house. i guess it's better safe than sorry, but it gets old. i don't know if that fear was there before i heard about my mom or if it just got worse after it. my mom has been through some stuff that i can't even imagine, and that i didn't find out about until this year. that would be weird, determining when your kids are old enough to tell them about certain things. like her mom. my mom's mom was my favorite person in the world. she was always smiling and happy and genuinely kind to and interested in everyone around her, especially strangers. i found out also recently that she went through a long depression spell and when my mom was younger got electroshock therapy that changed her life. it hurt me when i found out about that because it seemed that i was in love with a different woman because it supposedly changed her personality dramatically. i don't really even know much about it. i really hope trey finds something he loves in this world. i really wish i knew how to motivate him. he told me the other night that he feels like a loser around mje sometimes, even though he is not at all. he is taking classes at acc, where there isn't much school involvement or much room or making new friends. i'm at ut taking 16 hours, with goals and ambitions and a new social life and a new school to be excited about. i really can't imagine us not staying together but we've been through so much and it really seems like we are perfect for one another, it has since the first day. i get really sick of people saying i'm too young to know. maybe i am, but i am a strong believer in finding things out for myself. i always have been. i miss high school sports a lot. that's where i got a lot of my self-esteem from. those underclassmen and everyone looked up to me so much. i know that i am changing here, even though it hasn't really been new for very long, and i just hope i remember who i was when all this is said and done. i like myself and i don't' ever want to be just a person in the masses. i don't think i'm doing this free-write right. i don't think its supposed to be as much about my personal life. i just really have a lot on my mind, and i guess everyone else does too. i have to go eat dinner before i go get dressed for tonight so i'm glad the time is almost up. it almost feels better just to write everything down. i used to do that a lot. write out my thoughts whenever i was stressed or upset. now i'm so stressed i don't even have time to do that. car rides are just about the only time i have to myself. or when i'm working out. that's always nice, until it ends and i have to go to class all sweaty. i feel sorry for the people that have to sit by me after that!

"i don't like being home alone as much as i thought i would like it. i want talia to come back already. i can't believe she also takes zoloft this is too weird. i kinnda want her to be normal because now i just think the both of us are too weird together. it was such a coincidence that we got paired up together as roomates. i was talking to chris and everytime i do i feel so much more homesick. i can't decide if like him or not. well i like him. but i don't know if i like him more than a friend. i probably like william more. yes i do. i wonder what he is doing right now. it is raining and i don't like that. i hate the rain. i feel scared that something bad will happen. this song is funny. i guess they don't like jermaine dupri. i had some really good french vanilla coffee but now my throat hurts because it was way too hot. i really miss charm and all the guys. i felt so sad because they went out without me. ok the comp just made a strange noise that i don't like. that really scared me i thought i had broken talia's computer. i would really be in trouble then. damn it feels like i've been writing for longer than 6 mins. but oh well. i wonder wat chris is doing right at this moment. i wish i could see him. he can always make me laugh. speaking of funny people, i really miss emy. he's the love of my life, without it being in any way romantic. i would do anything for him and i worry about him so much. i really hope he is doing ok because if he isn't i would drop everything hear in austin just to be with him. the people in my floor piss me off all the time because they are always yelling and i can't stand that they don't have the courtesy to be quiet at night. they really annoy me. i wonder if that comedy show is going to be on tonight. i really like that show. i wish i had more of that coffee. even though it burned my throat. i ate pizza today and it wasn't the best thing in the world. i'm going to remember that for next time. i eat way too much sometimes. i am so fat i don't need to eat more. how the hell did i get to weigh so much? i just can't believe it. i hate walking around and seeing all those pretty girls. i spend most of the day being jealus of them all. i don't know how to make myself stop eating and to start working out. i mean i have a gym right downstairs but even that embarrasses me because i don't want people to see the fat girl working out. that's why people work out, to lose weight. but i just can't get out of that mindset. it is way too cold in my room. i'm going to get sick. i have to do so much homework. especially biology because i don't understand anything in that class and we might have a quiz next week. i won't do too good on that. chemistry is pretty good i think. i got a little confused last night with the homework but i'm hoping to work that out. biology 212 is not that bad. at least i don't feel like falling asleep right then and there like in bio 211, i really don't like my instructor. she's so damn boring and she tries to be funny but i doesn't work. i really hope i don't do too bad this semester. i hope to get at least b's in all my classes. a's are impossible in college i think. i'm really worried about my scholarship from d. d. hachar, i haven't gotten the half from ut that i'm supposed to get. i really should call the office or stop by. and i should also go and settle the matter with the mental health office too, i don't want maribel to keep bugging me about it. this is really not cool, i don't want to have to do that. but oh well. i guess if i have to. i should write an email to the finacial aid office asking them about my scholarship. or maybe i should try to contact the nursing school. maybe i don't even have that scholarship anymore. that would suck if i don't. i really need the money. i don't want my parents to worry about me or money. i can't wait until i have money of my own to help them out. i wonder if i'll ever become famous like i always dream about. i dream about so many things itz hard to keep track. i'm almost done. wow, that went by quickly. this wasn't so bad. i wonder if they're really going to read this thing. i doubt they have time.

"so, i am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. i am wondering about this class, i have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'a' in it. i really hope that i can because i am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. i feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and i stay home and read well last night i just goofed off most of the night because i couldn't concentrate. since i don't know what to expect on our first college tests i am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. i had a lot of fun at the delt pledge party this weekend though, i was a time that i went out and it was worth it. i just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; i will need to fix that in a minute because i know the computer is right. it felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. the football game is going to be horribly hot but i can't wait! i really need to get back into typing. i mean that i have been making a lot of typos i hope that i am catching them. i am listening to simon and garfunkle i love them, one of my best friends, hilary and i used to always sing to ""cecilia"". hilary goes to tech; i haven't talked to her in a while. i need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but i am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. it will be better tomorrow because i only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on friday. monday i have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! it's been nice since we haven't had a monday class yet, though. i went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so i tried to go to gregory but i forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. i went to the coop to return 2 books but the worker told me that i needed to bring another receipt so i'll have to back tomorrow. i have been trying to stay on campus on days that i have classes with breaks that are 1' hours or less between classes. that makes me read and eat lunch outside and so i don't waste time walking home and back to class. it is a good plan but by the end of the day i am very tired. i like this writing assignment. it make me aware of what i think about randomly i guess that is the point of the project. i want to see the movie ""bring it on"" it's a cheerleader movie. i heard it was corny but that i would like it i cheered in high school and so i guess it's a given that i would enjoy anything of this sort. i can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game i love football too. it's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. it sort of feels like i am at camp. i like it here. oh, it's been 22 minutes! bye ",0,-1.235237 0.486502 1.751439 0.101892 -0.410889 0.843692 -0.850323 -0.57972 -1.205047 -0.226927 -0.09141 -0.590446 -0.249265 0.809531 -0.672977 0.0 -0.04277 -0.009527 0.322969 -0.268752 0.268385 -0.742368 -1.027909 -1.84035 -0.624052 0.731944 0.993208 0.725447 -0.997814 -0.109265 0.452109 -0.293784 -1.317229 -0.446943 -0.705829 -0.694709 -0.106185 0.26077 -0.702424 -0.308125 0.216547 -0.853532 -0.44421 0.29196 0.343879 0.213312 -0.082493 -1.270407 0.080502 -1.272304 -1.34699 0.499614 0.830139 -0.124145 0.172824 0.900667 1.447464 0.448957 -0.303422 1.019982 1.424388 1.395996 -0.480161 0.158339 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.727412 -0.409071 0.087244 1.601755 -0.607823 0.248278 -0.337085 1.117195 0.192059 -0.451544 -0.111607 -0.481568 4.725025 3.652418 4.936298 4.843225 4.365085,1266
"okay, now is the time -- i usually don't have trouble writing for a long period of time - at least typing, because i think i type faster than i write. i am continuously writing e-mails to people. in fact, one semester i was even addicted to the internet! i was always on it. i wasn't as bad as my roommate at the time thought he never even went to class! i couldn't believe it. at least i knew to be addicted at nighttime! anyway - i enjoy typing and i really enjoy writing my thoughts. this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior year in high school when we got to read james joyce in my english class. it was the best book i read all year - the portrait of the artis as a young man - does this computer have a way to skip to the next line, or do i do that myself? well - i shall do it myself. ok - anyway - about stephen dedalus - in james joyce. the entire book was written the way i am writing this essay. i guess it is an essay -- i always thought they were spelled like s. a. ! but - that seems stupid when you think about it. psychology really seems interesting. but - i know the tests are hard. i am graduating in december and i have always wanted to take psy. i just never had the time when it came to my major and all the government, etc. classes i had to take. i can't wait to graduate. there is so much red tape at this institution. yesterday - just to add into a class that wasn't even full - my god. you would think the class is controlled by zeus himself! i had to fill out forms - and then i had to make inquiries and get permission from the professor. just so i could take accounting 310f for non- business majors that isn't even a grade for me since i am taking it pass'fail. now does that not sound stupid. sometimes i think education has become too much like government. not enough quality - just a lot of quantity of bs where nothing is really ever accomplished. the status quo just seems to prevail. i think that is terrible. but -if you think about it - it makes sense. this institution cares not if i get a good education- but rather if i am able to jump through all the hoops it places before me. whether i can read the fine print and take all the courses and get all the red tape cut before i graduate. is that what the college experience should be about? i guess college prepares a person for life. not in the classes taken per se - but in the lifestyle of the student. so - if i understand that life is simply college magnified, and if i can jump through all the hoops placed before me in college and actually graduate with my 120 hours, then maybe life won't be as complicated and difficult. the question then becomes if life gets more simple and less strenuous and frustrated, then shouldn't college follow in suit? since i don't believe that will ever happen, i guess the college is here to stay. if anything - college prepares a person for graduate school! law school, oy - a yiddish expression - i can't wait for that! i am taking a course now on constitutional law by dr. perry. i absolutely love it. - it mystifies me, the constitution. what does is cover - what responsibilities does it have. how does one know? all these questions can be answered and asked in this class. there are only 10 people in the class - compared to the 500 or so in psy. class, i would say that's pretty good! i think i figured out how to do these lines on this computer i just have to push return before getting to the end of the line instead of writing one line to eternity. how does the ta actually know that i spent 20 minutes on this? what if i simply type really fast and i get more words on the screen than the next guy? what if i say -- well, it's only been 5 minutes but - i gotta go? who ever thought of that movie with woody allen about the future and sex is regulated! damn! i promised myself to write about everything in the world not having anything to do with sex. i thought that for 20 minutes i could think of not having sex. damn. i guess i am just a typical 21 year old guy who can't get his mind out of the gutter. that really upsets me i always thought i could be more than the average joe. well - that shall be for my next paper on the college experience. boy - are y'all gonna love that or what?!! gotta go now -- the professor is calling me!!!

"right now i'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. how can i find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. well i guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. that sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. which is i am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. this gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. so far since school started i have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. i have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. i want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in new york. now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. i got a girl that i'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. is it possible that i can expect our relationship to work out? i know i want it to, i know i want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something i can manage. are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. it just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. then i start wondering about my best friend who went to arizona and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. i miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because i feel i don't act like my true self around new people. i am not trying to be fake with anyone, but i can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and i don't like that. i just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because i would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. even though i got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that i spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences.

"9:55. 20 minutes. time? why did i wait so loong to do this? well i didnt know about it until thursday, but still, what happened friday? oh yeah, i slept i think or maybe not it seems so far away. i guess its worth waiting since i got to see elise. god i sometimes feel like we are in competition and i keep reminding myself that it can't be like that. of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. i wonder why i have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since i've been here. elise i can kind of see because she is older and attractive but i would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. god i need to loose weight. why did she think i didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell i had? maybe she feels threatened like i do. i bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. i kind of want to skip the greek festivle because i am afraid. i'm afraid of being the odd one out. ok obviously i willl be like the only non greek. niko,. how i wish i was greek or smatter sometimes. i miss feeling loved. i miss feeling strong and powerful. although i do feel that way here sometimes. texas just isn't right for my balance i think. then again this is an emotional time of the month. but no i have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. i gues sits good to face, but at the same time i just want to crawl back home to paris. will i always think of it as home i wonder. god, sometimes the future is hopless. dear god, why do i sometimes feel this desperate? i know there are a lot of things i have done wrong, but i also know that i have been forgiven. lord, i love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which i can get to a church so that i can get the spiritual nourishment i need. i am starting to feel drained'. my father, jesus christ, please help me to help elise. help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. lord i pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. christ jesus please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. after vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. please help remind me not to give up, that mistakes are just that nad that i neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. lord jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because i know i don't have it. please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. lord i pray for jules. my heart is breaking for him because i love him so much. the thought of him tears me apart lord. i know that everything happens for a reason and that i am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when i see it and to embrace it willingly as i believe i do now. lord please continue to work in the life of jules. help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. help him to understand how i know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that i am able to experience any time. give him peace lord jesus from whatever may torture his mind. help eric and kate to find the same things too. to be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time? 10:16.

"ok so right about now i'm thinking about what a great and interesting assignment this is . i am also thinking about all the stuff covered during the last classs about the brain i can actually see my brain working, with all that left and right functioning stuff. my thoughts are now drifting a bit becasue the phone just rang but it was for my roomate. now i'm thinking about this one girl i sat next the last couple of classes we were usually arow or two apart but man i really thinkshe is beautiful. i hope to sit right next to her this upcoming class and start up a conversation or something. i hope she likes me, i'm nervous as all hell. ok now i'm thinking about all the stuff i have to do today. after this assignment ill probably ask someone to do my laundry, then ill do some english and chem and of course the dreadful calculus. my sensations are somewhat jumbled i feel kinda depressed just because i have been looking for a girlfriend for so long and can't find the right one. i feel like i have so much love to give but noone to give it to. also i really miss my friends from home in san antonio. there are about three girls i have my eye on right about now. this one girl i went to camp texas with whose name is julie, that girl from psychology class, and this girl i have been in love with for about a year( but she is in san antonio and has a boyfriend) , i usually think about her every hour of th eday and dream about her like four days out of the week. yeah i reallly miss kristin a lot. sometimes i see myself kicking that boyfirens ass but then i think about how upset it would make kristin. almost everything i do is to show her that i am better thatn that loser of hers. iv'e never met anyone remotely similar to kristin, one of a kind. oh well i got to stop thinking about it or ill end up in tears again. anyways i really can't wait till september 28 because this band that is from my home town in san diego california is finally putting out a cd and it comes out that day. this band(sublime) is actually old but the lead singer died in 96 of an overdose and the band members finally got over the death and decided they ow it to him to keep playing, there motto was long live the sublime sound. there sound is like a mix of a lot of reagae, punk, hip hop, and some spanish stuff in there to. so since they were going to need a knwe lead singer, they got a long time friend of the band , opie ortiz, a tatoo artist from southern cali, to sing. there new name is ""long beach dub all atars"" i could go on and on about hte history of this band and what is goung on but it would get crazy and who ever reads this would think in crazy, good thing noone is going to read it. that would kinda be crapy if anyone read this becasue they would be like reading my mind or something. i just found out i have three minutes left and i wish i could stihere and do this all day for real m like in a zone or somrething. right now i'm stumped i don't think me mind is moving at all, i'm ust thinking about hitting the right key. i feel like typing out the lyrics to the song badfish right now becasue they are about love afor a girl and for the beach and ocean and the su, and big reefs underwater, god and all these things that ust hit me hard.

"i met this guy mark thursday and today we had breakfast together. i really like him, but i don't know how to express myself around him. i get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. i have a nervous tick in my stomach when i think of him, like now. i feel like calling or emailing him, but i can't find the guts to. at breakfast, it took my five minutes before i could stop shaking. no one noticed but i could feel my knees quiver. school is not exactly what i thought it would be. there is so much reading, and i don't know if i'm absorbing it all into my brain. so many fun things to do, i make myself sit and read. i try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. i try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but i suffer as much failure as i do success. i have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and i'm lucky if i get the times and meeting places correct. i guess that's why i bought a cool ut planner which i carry with me everywhere! my mom was the same way i am. she procrastinated more in college than i am and did very well. i don't want to fail. i think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and i zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. i miss the familiar faces and places of port lavaca. i miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. tears come to my eyes. i haven't cried in a very long time, not even when i came back from the long labor day weekend. when i talk on the phone with my parents i swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. i want to succeed here and i'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. as a little girl, i came to many ut football games. my dream was to be a student here. considering i was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. i love the university and i'm glad i choose ut over southwest texas. southwest does have the best speech pathology program in the state, but i can not see myself anywhere, but here. when i think of that the sadness goes away, but i'm still left with an incredible amount of work that i am trying to accomplish. my dad works very hard. he only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. i can't tell if he likes work. he almost hates his sister's husband. i don't like him either. a total jerk and i feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. i think my dad is happy. he always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. he loved it. he was an average student in high school, most likely had add or adhd. we've always been close, but sometimes i feel like he disregards my feelings. we're both athletic, but i got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and i, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. i hope he knows i love him very much.

"right now i am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend. my roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls. my computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups. speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it? is it with an ie of ei whatever i guess it really doesn't matter. i just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate. the delivery guy was chill, i like ups. my roommate just put on a dave matthews dvd so at least i'm listening to some pretty sweet music. i am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie. it looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good. i just looked to my right and noticed my bike which i have not ridden since i got to austin. its a hoffman condor, which is a pretty sweet bike, i guess i should use it a little more. me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in chicago, that was tight. you would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond. my roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now. its cool. i just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had. he goes to acc and has no friday classes. he then skipped monday because he didn't have his car. today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having. he just asked me ""travis where are we eating tonight. "" that kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. i love college. dave is now playing granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. i love this song. dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . ggggggggggoooooooooo. ut is turning out to be pretty sweet. i love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. my last school had 1200 students so i knew just about everyone i saw, its a little different here, but its all good. just looked at the timer and it looks like i got about 3 minutes left. is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay? anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. phsycology is very interesting i really liked the lie detector test. props to michael for tricking that thing the second time around. just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought? one minute left that's really all i'm thinking about right now. the class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. bye.

"right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes. but i'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet. ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things i don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. i think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad i think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. he's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. i'm going to be so behind in economics. i tell you. i really like that class though. so anyways. i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. a very few. whatever. i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. i just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" i think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"". that is really very jr. high. i miss those days. i wonder how cindy is doing. ugh. i really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again. i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. damn that sounds really conceited. maybe i'm a little of that too. i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. it's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. within reason that is. so anyway. i am these things but i feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted. i know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. i am so proud of myself lately. i am being such a good girl. although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway. i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. i'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. i have been developing such good habits. i make my bed everyday, i wash my face twice a day, i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early. o shit. i just got a little flash of procrastination. that sneaky devil. no go away!!!. i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. i just don't have the time for that. i run every day . mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. damn that dinner. ugh. what else do i do. o yea. i didn't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too. i haven't been drinking. i haven't been too flakey. with the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. anyway we are good terms at the present. i'm being a pretty good daughter. i finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. i want to write about something cool. no luck. i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes. bad flutes in lol. i'm probably really bad by now. i wonder if there is practice rooms around. i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. i thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. and then i would act all shy and innocent. it's just how i act. natural reflex to wanted attention. sometimes i think i'm so stupid. and then they would flatter me and ask me out. and i would act like i wasn't really sure. i little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so i imagine) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. this has been a pleasant venting experience i tell you.

"i suppose we all get caught up in a web our first year. i wonder sometimes if it is going to be too much for me to handle. i guess everyone feels the way i do. people sure make me feel that they are smarter than me though. i should do well. why not, i have just as much potential as the next person. this person sitting next to me now is making me tense. i wonder why. come on chris, your a drama major, your not suppose to feel nervous. i feel better now that she left though. man some of these people really type fast. i don't even hear any pauses. great, another victim sitting next to me. i suppose we are all victims though. i wonder what everyone else wrote on this paper. it feels a little odd. seems kind of like my mind just rambles on. i guess everyone's does though. i really need to speed up my typing. i used to be so quick. i really have a lot of stuff to do today. man i miss my best friends. i miss kelly even though i hate to admit it. it seems like i tell her that more than i tell anyone else. maybe she is the same way. i know she probably is making up some reason why i don't love her anymore. she is just whiny like that. i wish she wasn't so negative. i'm always going to love her. too bad she is in dallas. ok, somebody turn on the air in here. it is getting a little warm. i wonder what bret and brian are up to. i know courtney is mad at me but i only wish she knew the way chad really is. i mean, it is not like i'm the only one telling her to watch out. ten minutes to go, or is it five? oh well, i'll just keep pecking at the keys. i really don't want to go to class today. i don't know how people can skip though. that is all i need is to get behind on all my work. i still have another one of these things to write tomorrow. my classes are cool though. i shouldn't panic too much. come on, i'm only taking 12 hours. but then, i am just a fish. i'm sure most people feel the same way. i know micah does. i wonder if he ever goes out and does anything. i'm really surprised that he came to mihir's party with us. ahhh, he had a good time. this city is definitely not dallas. i hate to admit it, but, i think i like it better there. i wonder who i will end up together with. i'm lonely but yet i don't think that i want anything serious. oh what do i know? 12:01, i think i have 4 more minutes. whoever is reading this probably thinks i'm nuts. i wonder if someone really is going to read all of this since there is so many students. wow, the typing is getting better. it is funny what a little practice will do. i wonder if they have a word processor down here. why does everything have to be online. it might not be so bad if i could get mine to work. i wonder what i am going to do. oh well. yea, finally through.

"being a twin i always wonder if my brother thinks like i do. i don't mean like does he have the same thought i mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me. my mind like to wander and i imagine many different scenarios in my head. like where i will be in 20 years how long i will live and why people act the way they do. everyday i think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest. then you have people who succeed no matter what and i wonder why them. then there are people who seem to go no where in life. i am not seriously making this up for the past year or so i have been trying to figure out the world. i guess since i have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home. i also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career. i felt at one time i was determined to be an astronaut, but now i am leaning towards the media business. i would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life. although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad and good experience. i am talking about me coming to college. if this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how i think i continuously switching ideas in my mind. it is a wonder of why i have some of the thoughts i have, but we wont go into that. being my first to take psychology i wonder what the class is going to offer me, how it will help me to explore the human mind. i have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed i stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends. since being here i have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes, but i often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable. this summer i worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how i should view the world. there would be weeks when i got up at before 5:00 am everyday i kind of got this feeling like is this what i will be doing for the rest of my life. i thought to myself therefore i will do good in college to help better the career. working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars i wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and i guess they do somehow. that is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when i believe there is an overall problem in certain area. but are we certain at all what goes on.

"at this particular moment i am considering whether or not i should have started this stream of consciousness thing or whether i should be cooking some food. since i'm pretty hungry, i'm not sure it was a good idea for me to have started this knowing that i have to keep typing for another 19 minutes or so. hopefully my stomach will hold out long enough. other than that i am wondering why you are having us do this assignment. is it like the experimental research that is required; are some of our samples going to be used in some psychological theory? or, is this for our benifit, will i come to some startling realizations about how my mind works that will totally change my life? well, tracking what i have written so far, it appears that my priorities are food, and other necessities. then i go on to question the purpose of this assignment. it appears that whoevers hierarchy idea was correct. i'm thinking mavlov, but i might be wrong. any way he said that once the basic needs were taken care of then the person should work on the higher needs such as love and peace and democracy and all that, but untill everyone can be secure in an environment with their needs provided for them they will not be to worried about the finer things in life or be able to attain them for that matter. for that matter. for that matter i don't even know what for that matter means. i guesse it means also. what a waste of words. wow i'm also noticing that i have stopped using propper pronunciation. cool. i guesse thats the assignment so who am i to argue hmmmm pronunciation is a waste of time a constriction gets in the way of us getting our thoughts onto a hyperlinked web page i suppose the brain doesn't think in pronunciation but it sure helps everyone else if the writings are organized in one particular manner anyway i don't really care about that too much i think the real reason for this assignment is so that we will get comfortable with this set up. i'm sure the real objective will be revealed in a later assssignment this is just getting us used to it and able to pour our thoughts over teh keyboard in a somewhat coherent if illogical way. why am i so interested in teh purpose? hmm. maby i should just do it and not care what teh purpose is maby ignorance is bliss maby this is a psychological evaluation by the fbi to determine if i am eligible to be a programmed assasin like mel gibson in conspiracy theory, ironic that was a consppiracy therory of my own coincidence ? i'll let whoever reads this thing, if anyone, decide. like i said before i need to make some food because i'm hungry i know i'm supposed to do this for 20 minutes but i wasn't really keeping tracki of time but since i type faster and think faster than the aaverage person i'm sure that i put enough stuff down to count yeah proba ly so proavba lj asdflja probably so.

"" and when my friends persist, i can't use the excuse, my parents won't let me, which makes it even more difficult! i know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that i will cherish forever. i am excited about my next four years here and am quite sure that with my determination and hard work, i will succeed not only at the university of texas, but in life as well!

"i'm mad because i had just typed for twenty minutes and now i have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. ahhhhhh, i'm mad. anyways today i turned 18. i'm so happy. now i'm just going to write about anything because i'm hungry and tired. today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. i'm mad. tomorrow i'm going to san antonio and i hope me three friends from dallas can come visit me. it'll be all of them, johnny, cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. lauren's letter made me cry. it was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. it was sweet too. jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and i thought he hated me since i'm with johnny and all. that was sweet of him, but i wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. he used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. my other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. anyways, being 18 will be cool. i finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. i also get to get my own bank account, either wells fargo or the university federal credit union. i also get to go get my driver's license, because i never went to driver's education. yeah! okay, i'm a little happy now. johnny is a good boyfriend though. he really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. like he rather be with me than his friends. that's cool sometimes, but i saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. he hasn't called me yet. oh oh i'm sad again. i miss him, and i'm glad i get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. i still have homework or should i say dormwork to do. hahahaha! okay that was corny, but i'm still cool. oh yeah i'm going to a party at around 9:30. oh oh i guess i'll have to call johnny by then if he doesn't call me. he said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. i know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. well it's still light outside, so i guess that's okay. two more minutes and i hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. well today was a great day and i feel like doey howser typing away at my computer. that was dumb but i'm mad so i guess that's okay. well times up, bye.

"this is a very interesting time right now. right now, i have so many different feelings inside me right now. this is a new part of my life, yet it does not feel all that different. i guess it's because there are so many familiar faces here and i'm still pretty close to home. i'm kind of glad about that, it makes me feel much more secure. i really want to take full advantage of my college life. i want to meet people, i want to have fun, i want to experience everything, and i want to do all that and keep myself on track. i signed up for a ballet ii class and a street jazz class over at the union the other day. i figured that while i did not want to get heads over heels into dance again, i definitely didn't want to give it up because i still love it, so this was great for me because it will be a casual class and it's basically right across the street from me. i also signed up for an informal ice skating class. figure skating was such a big part of me, but when i got too busy with belles, i had to stop, so i figured that now was the perfect time to start again. i knew it would be a beginner class, but i figured that it'd be good to work on basics. i took the bus there, got there late, and they were doing twofoot glides. no offense, but it truly was a beginner class. afterwards, michele (the teacher) saw me jumping and spinning on my own, so she's putting me in the more advanced class after the beginner class, which was really cool. i also met these two girls, kristen and claire, who were also in my class. they were so nice, they got off the ice before i did, but they actually waited until i got off and then they told me that they could bring me to and from the rink from now on so i wouldn't have to ride the bus, which i thought was just so incredibly nice of them. kristen brought me home, and claire gave me her number so that i can call her next week and she can bring me there. i was very happy last night because 1) i restarted a hobby that i truly have a passion for, and 2) i met new people and i feel like i am starting to create a new world for myself. seriously, that is one of the reasons that i loved figure skating so much, not just that i love the sport and that i love gliding across the ice and flying in the air to music, but because when i was skating, i was in my own world. it was like my safety, my refuge. so i am feeling very good that i am beginning to regain that. you don't realize how much you miss something until you actually do it again. i've been pretty happy with everything for the most part. it's been a nice and rather smooth transition, because it didn't feel like i was making too big of a transition. the main difference to me is that i don't have to worry about being home by a certain time to avoid making my parents mad. i don't have to worry about making my mom mad (because she takes everything so personally) and all that sort of stuff. i've been thinking about sean every now and then. just passing thoughts about him, wondering what he's up to, if he thinks about me, that sort of stuff. it's not like i spend all of my time thinking about him, but he passes my thoughts very often. i guess he'll always mean a lot to me. it's funny, because i've been so happy with everything lately, but today, i am feeling particularly angry with judy. just how judgmental she is upon me and how overly selfrighteous she is. i mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that (being selfrighteous), but with her, it is to a fault. it's to a point where she's hurt me and insulted me and angered me. and she claims to be watching out for me because she cares, but that's not what i call leaving me to find my own ride. she's let me down in a big way and she has no right to treat me like that. i'm not normally an angry person, but i am really upset with her right now! i really just don't want to talk to her for a while. going back to houston this weekend was a lot of fun, i really enjoyed seeing everybody again, although it was only for a little bit. one thing i like about having high school people here at ut is that even if i wasn't friends with them back in houston, it's kind of like, now that we're at college, we have some sort of bond because we're from the same place, so we become friends, which is really cool. anyhow, my twenty minutes are up, so i'll talk later! that's basically me for right now (or all that i can think of and remember right now anyways)!

" i know i said that i was ready to write but im not too sure exactly what i need to be doing. i hope this is right. great now im worrying. i worry way too much that is a problem of mine. i always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it i even worry about other people's problems. i wish i could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend joseph. he's also my roommate. now im now sure if this is right because im telling you about myself when im just supposed to be thinking. okay now im thinking. why is my room so hot. sometimes its not hot but right now im boiling. i think it is because i am nervous about this assignment. theres no reason to be i just need to type. well here i am typing. my room smells funny right now. joseph bought some cinna sticks from dominoes a while back and i think that they are going bvad. i know they are going bad. i need to take out the trash than. i hate that i get lazy and don't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob. great now i propbably sound all anal about mess when im not at all like that. well im not a messy person but you know. gosh reading over this i sound like such a pessimist and so boring. oh well. time sure is going by pretty slow. i want to make jell-o but i don't think i have room in fridge for it. gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now. i wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o . like how does it form the way it does? whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o. one day im going to find out. more than likely i won't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that im gooing to look into it. it makes me feel productive. im worried about my financial situation right now. i still have almost 4000 to pay off and i got a loan for that and all but i don't know where that money is or who i need to talk to in order to get my hands on it. tomorrow i guess ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that. i can't think of anything else right now. i feel like im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am i to say no. this should be an easy a or at least i hope. i hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because i said easy a then im going to get like a b or something. just in case im sorry even if this seems easy i do my work and i dedicate time so when it comes down to it, i think i deserve that a . great im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. i wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? i doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. but then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. is lenient even a word? oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was ms. ng, she scored perfect on her sat's. how the heck did she ever pull that off. and since she did i have no idea why shes teaching at edison. in case you dopnt know which you probably don't edison is a public inner-city school in san antonio and it does not have the best of reputations. i hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? and that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond edison . esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from edison. well thats their loss because im a great person to know and i don't fit the edison stereotype. there should be no stereotypes. they are just not fair. hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up. just 35 more seconds. 30 now. wow this is actually good stress relief i should do this more often when i have time.

"today has been one of the longest days of my life. i have had only one class today so i am constantly looking for some way to spend my time. it seems that everyone i know here on campus is in class or at work, therefore i am left alone with nothing to do. when i sit there with nothing to do i become very homesick. if it were not for my friday classes i would be long gone. it excites me however, that tomorrow i get to go home. i can't wait to be in my own house without a roommate or doors slamming through the night. one thing that i can't wait to see is my cousins. they are adorable. the oldest, sydney, is like the sister i never had despite the fact that she is only nine years old. i enjoy being around her and it makes me proud when she comes to me to ask personal questions. i have three other cousins too. leizl, who is five, is so cute and has such a wild imagination. it excites me to watch her imagination at work. she is one of the very few children left in this world that can entertain herself for hours with a paper towel roll. next is will, the little man. he is only two and is constantly making me laugh. he is in love with blues clues and power puff girls. he knows every word to the songs and has his own little dance for each of them too. the youngest, and i have to say my favorite, is little miss annie makenna. she turned one on august 30. the reason that i think i like her the most or think about her the most is the fact that we almost lost her. she was born with the strep virus in her lungs and spent the first month of her life in the icu on a lung machine. she is now a healthy little girl. she is now walking but it seems so weird to see her walk because she is only the size of a 6 month old. she is so tiny. i can't wait to see them. they are the world to me and i love them and miss them everyday. just as i do my parents and my brother. that is on thing that gets me down about college. i don't like being away from my family. i love them dearly. they mean everything to me. writing this paper has depressed me but i know that tomorrow i will get to see them all and spend the entire weekend with them. yeah! my brother is cool. i am one of the very few girls in this world that got blessed with an awesome older brother. he is three years older than me and he has always been there for me, much like my two loving parents. i thank god everyday for the family that he has given me and the support he has surrounded me with.

"well, i am almost ready to leave tomorrow back to my house in fort worth, although i would like it to be better to go back because since i have to work tomorrow, that makes it kind of boring and i cannot stop thinking about work instead of enjoy my time over there. every time i go i always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend, that actually never really happens, i don't really know how i feel about it because sometimes i feel frustrated that i cannot do anything about it but then i analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head. the fist thing i have to do before i leave is get all my homework done, including this assignment that i didn't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does. since the first day that i slept in this dorm, it seems that the bed is not for me or something, i cannot fall asleep, and if i do, i wake up every 20 min and look at my clock to see if it's time to go to class. i remember i used to love school when i was in high school last year, everything was so cool, nothing was going so bad to call it bad, grades, girlfriend, family money, but now some times i feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with, i cannot handle so much stress, never had so much actually. anyways, the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because i know i'm not a failer. hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good!. the biggest problem that i have and that i think already gave me a pain in my neck, well that's because i cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so i think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems. i have to pay my whole semester rent next monday, that's one of the reasons i'm going home tomorrow, to get a juicy check that will just fly away from my hands. i only i was living in my house and going to a college near, i would be able to keep all that money and use it to get rid of my debt and actually be able to buy a gift for my girlfriend. i have bunches of pictures of her all around my room. i also have pictures of my mother and little sister. she is 6 and i miss her. i hope tonight i can fall asleep easy so i won't be tired during my 2 hour drive. everytime i drive tired i get nervous and think that i may fall asleep and all these thoughts come to my mind that i'm going to crash a big truck and never make it home. i know that the odds are really small and then i get better once i start listening to this exact same music i'm listening to right now. its a band called mana, is from mexico and they play really good kidda alternative music but is really meaningful and then they talk about world peace and they help children with massive foundations, with no doubt my favorite band. they are coming to dallas next october, i can't wait till then to go to the concert, i went to one last november and i still remember almost every second of it, this time i'm thinking on taking my girlfriend to make the concert even better. i just hope that i will have money to but the tickets then, cause now i don't. jeje, a few hours ago i was doing my physics homework, it's just really hard, when i was in high school i was the best kid on physics and now i just feel really bad when i don't understand!, never happened before, i don't know if is because i cannot concentrate or because it's just really hard or because i'm loosing my intelligence, i think of that all the time, i have this scholarship that is helping me a lot with my finances but if my gpa goes down 3. 0 , they will take it away and then i will really be in deep trouble. i just saw a picture or one of the pictures i have of my girlfriend in my room and that reminded me that i have to ask her if her dad said yes! finally. we have been going out for almost a year and she just turned 18 last saturday, i was a really nice night, the problem is that her father doesn't know about us yet, we are afraid we might not like our relationship and then all would fall down. i feel guilty for making her disobey her dads rules but we love each other and finally i would be the happiest guy ever if i can make it trough this semester maintaining a good gpa and if my girlfriends dad agrees on our relationship. when i think of these, it feels like everything is worth it to wait and suffer and not sleep and study like crazy, so that's what i'm going to do ",0,-1.261088 0.05193 0.799686 0.008713 0.390505 0.680872 0.271069 0.00397 0.287158 0.916641 0.168359 -0.590446 -0.957354 1.301911 -0.327466 0.0 -0.04277 0.459122 0.748093 0.438994 0.907514 -0.742368 -0.439174 1.163449 0.170487 -0.745452 -0.222401 0.066655 0.059583 0.117203 0.199047 0.345683 -0.022935 0.01616 -0.808962 -0.276464 -0.304843 0.647089 0.132639 -0.485353 0.222041 -0.471517 0.648068 -0.010953 -0.717065 -0.170925 1.162998 -0.450403 -0.546638 -0.460189 -0.788841 1.914393 -0.524685 0.253439 1.278563 -0.53504 0.068175 0.455098 0.318067 0.106865 0.95639 0.406028 -0.480161 -0.140205 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.467609 0.874694 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.043302 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.293221 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.857812 4.869047 4.41198 4.781209 5.164132 3.95848,2148

"somtimes i don't understand why people are the way they are. why am i falling in love with a guy that i can't be with? i mean, my gah, we're perfect for each other other than the fact that he thinks i'm some sort of deluded tricked person who is believing wrong (referring to my religion). we're both stubborn in the aspect of our beliefs and aren't willing to compromise however there is this unnaturally strong bond, i guess you could say, between us. i don't know what to do. i want to be with him so bad, i really honestly and truly do however i'm afraid of getitng hurt again. maybe i am delusional, maybe its because i'm afraid i can't get a guy here. maybe i don't know what i believe or not. i question what i really want and often wonder why i choose to live the way i do. why do i sacrifice happiness for the sake of morality? something that would make me happy, why do i avoid it? because i'm afraid that god will condemn me to hell. yes, that must be it. i know i'm saved and that i will go to heaven however i feel that other people will condemn me, i will condemn myself and ultimately god will condemn me. fear of man, fear of myself, fear of god, fear of doing what i want, fear of getting pregnant if i choose to have sex, all of these things cause me inner turmoil. why be with a guy that's all the way up in new york and you're down in texas? i love him, i want to be with him, but i'm denying my inner feelings somehow--i don't know 100% what i feel or how i feel it. . i don't know if i'm creating some sort of mental captivity for myself by not choosing to be with him--am i missing out on the best thing of my life? he says all the right things, but does he truly mean what he says? i guess only showing will prove it. i do like this rose that he gave me. i mounted it on this background thing of new york city that i made. its a beautiful glass rose, but it broke in the mail. he was upset that it wasn't perfect however me and symbolism, i said it was better that it was broken because things aren't perfect, and even though it will be mended, it won't be perfect. and that's okay. nothing is perfect. the rose is so beautiful. it offsets the background and the statue of liberty infront of it. i love new york. do i love this guy because i love new york so much? or do i love new york so much because i love this guy? who knows? all i know is that its raining here, and i'm sitting alone in my dorm room, cold and alone. surrounded by the mass but alone in spirit. alone in body. alone. i think its stopped raining now, but i'm not sure if it will continue. i have no umbrella. i'm not prepared for the storm. like life, huh? you can prepare yourself for everything except the most obvious--what happens if it rains? you prepare for the cold, you prepare for the wind, you prepare for the ice. . but the rain comes, and you have nothing. no umbrella, nothing. all you have is what you took with you. . your books, your clothes, your hand, the trees or a overhang of a building. i came here to austin not knowing anything. i mean i knew what i've heard but i didn't actually know. i now know, and i don't know what to think. the mass is around me but i'm alone. . alone, cold standing in the rain with no umbrella. dreaming about the distance, and longing for the closeness. i've thought about becoming a psychologist. . however i don't know if i want to abandon business. i don't know what i want to do really. i mean, i know certain things i like however i don't know what i want to do with what i like. i like many things but i love little. i've always helped people with their problems, listened to their issues, offered my advice when prompted. maybe its time i get paid for it, lol. . i wrote in my notebook about becoming a psychology professor--that way i can interact with students, be in authority and teach about psychology. but i don't know if i want to do that. . why wouldn't i want to? money, travelling, i don't know to be honest. wow, ten minutes and i've typed a novel. . omg, i feel for the individual who has to read this, lol. i guess its a curse from typing since like the 4th grade. i think i can get up to like 100 words a minute now. . i was talking to this one guy online however i told him i would brb in 20 . he has a crush on me. i don't like him. i know its for superficial reasons, but i don't wish to get in an internet relationship, lol. yeah it would end up being an internet relationship. and i'm not about to go down that road, lol. . the first and only one was this one guy who ended up being a clingy-blood-craving-dog-collar-wearing-submissive ex-goth who liked to bite people. strange, eh? weird guys fall for me, lol. one guy. . omg, the state hospital patient--he hit on me while i was volunteering there for bingo, omg. that was scary, haha. then there was the drunk guy who said i was miss america 2002--poor kid, lol. . then, let's see. . the ex goth, the state hospital guy, the drunk dude. hmm, i know there's more. . ahh yes, boyfriend number one. the sex-craving chain smoker who was like 5 inches shorter than me. i learned from this guy to always tell your mother about your relationships. that stupid dork called my house at midnight and was saying nasty things to my mother thinking it was me, lol. i came home and my door was off the hinges, my tv, stereo and phone were out and she changed the dead bolts on my door. then we proceeded to go to the health clinic where i got the hepatitus a series vaccine (which is good to have anyways lol) and was threatened to get tested for aids. it was a traumatic experience, lol. darn those junior high days lol. . well i have less than five minutes left and have managed to go thru most all of my relationships. lol, wow, the more i remember them, the funnier they get. . my friends think they're hilarious lol. but one thing i've learned--i can't please everyone. i guess i have to live for myself and that's about it. though i have religion and the morals that confine me with that--it should be done out of love. . but right now i don't have love. i want love to give to god, but i'm so caught up in what i want and the inner turmoil that its causing me to just want happiness with this guy, i managed to squeeze out love or desire to grow with god more. . yes, it hurts to say it, and to acknowledge it. . but hey, i guess its the truth? i guess that's why this was the first assignment--so we can see what we really think and feel. . to write them out and to put them on the table so we can look at what we feel and not deny that we truly did think what we thought. hmm. two and a half minutes left. . i think i want to skip class. . lol, i'll go though. . i just hope i don't get rained on. a perfect ending to a perfect essay. . with one exception. perfection doesn't exist. morality doesn't want to exist. and i don't know where to find an umbrella. in the last few seconds or minutes or whatever, my mind wonders to the pasta i had for lunch. no clue as to why, lol, however i do like pasta. i wonder what i'll have for dinner. wow, this writing went from super deep to super light, topic wise lol. . grr, i got the trojan and mimic virus on my computer. . another lovely addition to another lovely day. time is up and i have class to go to. its been nice writing. . maybe i'll do this again. . typing of course--i can type faster than i can handwrite, lol. 3. 2. 1. times up. . ohh, i can continue writing. well, i can't now. i have psychology class.

" right now i am sitting here typing, with the tv on in the background and i am feeling very tired. i think this is because i didn't get nearly enough sleep last night. why didn't i get enough sleep, you ask. well i don't know. i usually go to bed sometime before eleven, or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve. i guess you could say between 11 and 12, right? yeah. and i start my day somewhere around 7:30. that is not nearly enough sleep. but what's funny is this is the only time of day when i feel really lethargic: around 5 or six o clock. maybe it is biological. maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies. i think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in mexico. that seems glorious. not to mention it's good for you! you are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy. even as i type i can feel myself drifting off. do not fall asleep. do not fall asleep. oh great. i pressed a wrong key and now the time started over. i had two minutes of typing under my belt. that's beautiful, just beautiful!!! i think i will just sit here and make up for that time. doop de doop. doop de dooooop. . . . . . well, i'm very glad it's friday tomorrow. not that it makes much of a difference, but still. i can sleep in on the weekend, that's a big deal to me. i'm not sure what i'll do with the weekend. probably catch up on reading for classes. i'm really concerned about that. i've been slacking off a bit and that's just awful, classes have only been in session for what, just two weeks or something. yuck. i'm such a procrastinator. well, i don't know what else to talk about. this is boring and i'm getting bored just doing this because i'd rather be napping. not to mention the clock says only 3 minutes and i know the true time should be somewhere around five!!!! here, this is entertainment. i will type out a poem completely from memory. ladies and gentlemen, the road less traveled by robert frost: two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler, long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way i doubt if i shall ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i, i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference. what a beauty of a poem, no? i've always liked it. don't remember why i had to memorize it. probably for a class way back in middle school. some people have told me they don't understand the last line. i just feel secret annoyance towards them. what's there not to understand?! it's clear as a bell, people! i like robert frost. here's another one i know called fire and ice: some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what i've tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice i think i know enough of hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice i also like stopping by woods on a snowy evening, the one that ends ""and miles to go before i sleep. "" yep. also that poem called nothing gold can stay. why do i know so much about robert frost you ask?! heck you got me. i don't even know. i just think his poems are nice. what other poets do i like. that's a good question. i have no idea. well, that's probably not true, but i can't think of any at the moment. in decathlon in school we studied lots of poems, by langston hughes and sylvia plath and robert frost (a really bad one, though) and george meredith and lots of other peeps. some of them were cool, some were most definitely not. i think i will write a poem of my own, right here, right now. i call it ""the cat came home"". the cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he didn't know was that the owners had moved away they left the lights on they left dishes in the sink the cat came home and in a swift minute didn't know what to think should i stay or should i go the cat asked himself that day what should i do about this what should i say? well the cat found no answers just an empty litter box so he said, eh who cares and tore up all the socks maybe i should get that one published! well my time is almost up thank goodness, so i should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment, a summation if you will. this was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why i don't get enough sleep. yep, that's all. nothing too exciting. and what do you expect. there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on tv at this moment.

" why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty and unimportant things? it seems as though when we leave the mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all the more important. when my roommate and i went shopping at the galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present. girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money onto daddy's credit cards. have many teens forgotten about the value and importance of money? i also this weekend began to wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and homophobic. my new friend kenny happens to be fixated on getting dates'girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes him. the entire time at the mall kenny asked my roommate and i if random people were hotter than he was. this relentless insecurity and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining. why can't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy at that? society's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and relationships. most people seek relationships on all levels with people who share the same interests and personality traits that support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that they themselves may not think on their own. why is love and relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen's life. i myself have realized recently that i've spent a great many years in relationships loving someone and being loved in return. we as a society place so much emphasis on dating, relationships, and marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at such goals. i mean look at the fixation that many college age individuals have on dating shows. in high school many an ap calculus class were spent discussing elimidate and the trashy or sexy guys'girls that were on the particular episode. i myself admit to watching the trash, but for some reason society has aimed my eye to these sort of shows. since i arrived on campus dorm life has truly agreed with me. i worried for months that my roomate would be just dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common. fortunately, my roommate and i have a great deal in common and are turning out to be great friends. the university has also provided me with many unexpected opportunities. besides the rec center, i'm signing up for rock climbing, the music school has turned out to be unexpectedly positive. i have played the violin since i was 8 years old . in the past year i have realinzed that i genuinely desired to teach music in elementary school. when i arrived at ut on the first day of school i was terrified of auditioning for the ut symphony orchestra. when i arrived outside of professor noe's office i was greeted by many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me. my nerves seemed to overwhelm me as i walked in the room. all i could think about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me. i felt that the audition went well but i was forced to wait the entire weekend for the results. as it turned out my audition had gone as well as i had felt. i was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st violin section. i can't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting people. alas, i have to go to work and spend my entire weekend hosting, babysitting, and waiting tables. hopefully everyone will come home from college on friday so we can catch up on all the new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other's company.

"i am sitting here wondering as to why i chose to do this assignment at this particular time. as i search my the thoughts the number one reason i can find is boredom. i am so bored right now, as i have throughout my entire ut experience. i miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. i have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but i feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that i have become accustomed to over the past 18 years. i'm pretty sure that i just used a runon sentence. five minutes down, fifteen to go. notice that i spelled out the words ""five"" and ""fifteen"" in order to waste. i am wasting this time because i don't feel any need to be introspective. i feel that i know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, i that i have no need to further analyze my thoughts. i am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. i'm sure that my high school english teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences i started with ""i"". although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word ""saw"". did you notice that i also spelled out the word eight. it has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. i hope that this writing is still here when i come back. i'm back. that took about a minute. sorry. i meant to right one minute. i wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. i wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? i wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? i feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. i feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. as this assignment comes to an end i wonder what i was supposed to have learned, for i feel that i am none the wiser. twenty minutes have now passed. the end.

"i am not exactly sure how this is supposed to work, but i will give it a try. i am wondering if i am thirsty because i see the aquafina bottle on my desk. i know i will jump to a random thought soon. i just have not figured out exactly what it is. i am thinking about going to my next class at 5:00 for the cal discussing, and i am wondering if there will be any good looking guys coming today. there are a few cute ones, but who knows why they won't say hello. i myself don't think that i am totally unattractive, and on occasion i have been known to look hot. now one of my friends would think that she was cuter and had a better body than me, but i do not think so. so anyhow that makes me think of how we went bowling the other day and that she did look like she had lost some weight because her pants looked good on her. she also has great hair, that never looks clumpy, how does she manage that? o just go to the store and buy any shampoo that i want but not her she buys the most expensive thing at the mall, we are so different, yet so alike. maybe i just like to put on the image that i don't care when i really do, while she cares and she admits it. right now i feel like turning on the tv so that i don't fall asleep while i am typing this assignment up. i always get sleepy around this time but i feel so guilty taking a nap because i have so much work that i should be doing. right now i hear rosie o'donnell in the background and they are talking about nyc and now i want to go hang out in new york with my friends and i also want to go each some chocolate chip cookies. i am the biggest chocoholic. but my dad has diabetes, so i have decided that i would start to be cautious about what i ate. right now i am trying to keep up with everything i am thinking but my fingers cannot move as fast as all my thoughts. i just saw a picture of a finger cut open, and quite frankly that is one of the most disgusting things i have ever seen. i am not really sure if i like my nail polish color, it is a cool color, but i am not entirely sure that it looks good on me. rosie just mentioned dogs which makes me think of my dog, cleopatra, who i miss very much. she is a black cocker spaniel with white patches on her stomach and, she has beautiful big brown eyes. she is one of the cutest things i have ever seen. she waits for my little brother to come home from school at the window next to our front door. oh yah i want to download dr. dre's new song, but for some reason i cannot remember the name of the song. and i can't get napster, because of this stupid ut network, so i have to use imesh, which is not as good as napster, because i can't just write in the name of a song. i have had quite a bit of computer trouble lately. but luckily it is all fixed and set up now, due to many nice people who have helped me set it up. i am really not computer savvy and my parents always get on my back about it, and i used to not pay attention but now i am thinking that i should, because there are so many cool things that computers can do, and i don't want to miss out. i also want to go shopping, but i don't have money, i want to be like i dream of jeanie or bewitched and just be able to blink in and out of outfits. i saw a campbell's soup commercial that said soup only has 100 calories. now i am watching a bit about a wonderful guy who is very loving toward his mother, which makes me think that i could make more of an effort to be better to my parents. ok my twenty minutes are up so i will stop typing.

"well, since i don't know how to start, i'll start by talking about my weekend. i just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. we started saturday. buck, carl, dylan, kevin, crystal, and i went to lake georgetown with my new boat. i made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. i actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. the only problem is that it hurts when you fall. i broke my nose the first time that i fell because i kneed myself in the face. i spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. the only problem with saturday is that crystal and carl got into a fight. they've been dating for a couple of weeks now. anyway, we went back to the lake sunday and i kept trying different things and now i'm pretty good on one ski. and it is a blast, i'll never go back to two skis. sunday night i played the role of mediator for everyone. i talked to crystal about carl and i talked to carl about crystal. they are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. then i talked to danielle about buck. danielle is one of crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. she liked buck a lot. buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. this is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. at least as far as i can tell. but i did a lot of talking and more importantly listening sunday. i think i helped smooth everything over with them for now. carl and crystal seem to be getting along better. i missed classes monday because of injuries that i received over the weekend. i broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. i couldn't even get out of bed monday morning. i'm starting to recover though. i had to go to work tuesday. i work at internet gateway in georgetown. i love working there except that i don't get paid near what i should be getting. i make $9'hr. that should be 23 times more, but i only work 2 days a week anyway. i was working full time but i decided that since i have to go to school, i should make it my top priority. i didn't want to go to college, i'm not sure that i want to now that i'm going; but i know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. that's really the only reason i'm going is because my mom wanted me to. actually my whole family was pushing me to go. this is ok though because i know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. especially when i start looking for a better paying job. although, college has been really fun so far. i have had my own house since this summer. buck and i are roommates and we are renting a house in georgetown. it is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that i have my own place. buck and i met at work. his dad owns the company where i am employed and he started working there during the spring. we have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. he is a good guy. we have a lot in common too. i've been lucky in that regard. i have a lot of good friends, and several that i can depend on for anything. it is a really good feeling to know that i can trust someone like buck with my life. i've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. my stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. well, i've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and i have to go back to work now.

"life as a college student is not quite like how i had expected. when i was a senior in high school, i thought i was going to be a studious student having a lot fun. but two weeks into college and i'm already slacking off. most freshman who start off college don't really know what's going on, but i guess you can say that i had an early start. this was because my older sister, lisa, also attends ut. with this factor, i quickly started to hang out with my sisters friends and began slacking off. so what i am saying is that, if i didn't have someone that knew what was up, than i would probably be having an easier time staying on track. maybe its just me, but that is how i feel. but i am having a lot of fun, i guess you can say. i met a few people from orientation. they are the people that i am usually with. but i am having a hard time making friends in my classes. it might be because i'm always late to class and i never get a chance to settle down before class starts, probably. well, i'm hoping to make some really good friends here. isn't there a saying that a person makes most of their ""life long"" friends in college? i don't know. i don't even know why i am talking about my personal life for a homework assignment. i don't know if i am even doing it correctly. i guess that i will find out when i get my grade for it. its been fourteen minutes and i am already running out of things to say. okay, i'm going to return to what i was talking about in the beginning, school life. i really feel that i need to get myself prioritized. i need to catch up with all my work and get ready for my up coming tests. i really don't know what else to write and i think this is about 20 minutes, so that it.

"the first thought that enters into my mind is my parents, whom i have been thinking about since i left houston for college. it's so different here, but not necessarily bad. i have always been under the protection of my parents. but here, i don't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed, and what to do. i literally make all my choices, which i have to admit, i don't always make the best decisions. i don't study when i know i should. sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that i know i should, and doing things like going out and having fun. i feel like i should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute. but back to my parents, i feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me, because i am the last kid to leave home. my mom has been crying constantly and i know that she is lonely because she doesn't have me bumming around the house and eating her food. sometimes i even feel sad because i now realize all the things my parents have done for me. even though i thought they were always against me. when i think about the things they have sacrificed for me, i get teary. especially when i think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before i left for austin. i got an acura integra, nothing i had ever expected. i was so ecstatic and i had never gotten such a great present in my whole life. i know that my dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than i had expected. and now i'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that i had taken for granted. i really miss my parents and sometimes i have trouble dealing with it. it's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own. my values are seriously getting tested because i don't have them to give me advice anymore. all i keep thinking is how much i love them and how i can possibly show my gratitude for them. college is a tough thing. even though i went to an enormous high school, it can't compare to college. my classes are huge, and sometimes very monotonous and boring. surprisingly, the class i had thought was going to be tough and boring, became one of my favorites, economy. mainly because my professor, hamermesh, is a great teacher. he is lively and so humorous. the other classes, i really don't care for much. one thing i do hate about college life is the roommates. i live off campus on enfield, in a really nice apartment'condo. my dad bought it with the intention that i have a nice place to live. it is two stories, and i have been trying to decorate it the best that i can. but the problem is that i have to have roommates. one is this white girl, karmin, who i never met. my dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in austin, looking for a roommate and she applied. the other is a chinese girl, laura, i have known since i was a child. i share a room with laura, so karmin has her own room, and she pays a little more. however, i still end up paying more because it's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways. so karmin pays 350 for her own room, which i consider a good deal. laura is really messy, which bothers the heck out of me. but lately, i have been dealing with it pretty well. karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind. she is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household. but she is messy, especially in public areas and i am the one who has to clean up after her. and the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy. she has a big tv in her own room, and vcr and then on the other hand, comes and watches tv that laura and i own. so we are not allowed to use it. i borrowed her vcr the other day, and she asked me, ""when are you going to buy your own vcr?"" still, she isn't willing to share but doesn't mind using our things. same with the food. i really feel the need to tell her off, because she sure is getting a good deal living over here, and she can't have the right to treat this place as her own, she needs to respect us. not only that, she hammered nails all up in her room, knowing that she is only living her for a year and it's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next. that's my biggest problem and whenever i talk about it, i feel really agitated and stressed. well, all i feel now is relief though, because my 20 minutes are up!

"why do we even have computers if they are so slow and crappy and can't hold more than ""x"" number of people at a time. time. and why can't i put chip smart out of business. they sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. we had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. i am pretty ticked off right at the moment. i don't feel like writing this assignment. i had to buy first aid 98 to get the new modem to work. it just started working after a long and horrid battle so i am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. i don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. i hope you really aren't reading this, because i am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. i can think of nothing else but the immense dislike i have for my computer. i should name it lucifer. let me tell you a little about myself. i just got married aug. 8. therefore i am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at bridge hollow here in austin. i miss my father. his birthday was 9-7 and i forgot!!!!!!! i felt like crying all day. i miss my mother too. her birthday is coming up in february. (2-5-51) i truly don't know my father's age. he is older than my mom i know. they divorced when i was 5. after that i guess i lost count. i was adopted here in austin at marywood. i was extremely lucky, because i got the best 2 parents in the whole world! i truly mean that. i love them. i also miss my brother. he is in the waco youth center right now doing much better. he wants to start working on his career now. he had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. he is 3 years younger than me and is learning disabled. he had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. this center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. well, as you can probably tell i love my family. more importantly i love god because he sent his son jesus to die for my sins and because i accept him, believe in him, and in return i have given him my life to use me for his glory. time is up.

"right now it id 9:30 in the morning and i wish that i was still asleep. i had a biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. i don't really understand what goes on in that class. science isn't my best subject, but i guess i am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. and if i don't do well in those classes, i can't get accepted into upper divison. i'm not sure. i have been thinking about changing out of nursing because i really want to dance but i just don't think that there is a living in that profession. but at least i would really enjoy it. i wish i were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. he does what he wants because he wants to do it. he isn't worried about his future and i know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. and he is good at it. i just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. i wish i could push myself more, but i just don't have the motivation. i try at least. my classes are really hard and i am worried about doing well in them. this is my first time to be away from home and i want to prove to everyone that i am not as incapable as everyone thinks that i am. my own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. he thinks that i can't hold my own and that i have to depend on everyone else to help me through what i do. and maybe in some aspects that is true. i have had a difficult time just being myslef. i feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what i say isn't as important as the next person. enough about my problems though, right? today i am going to get a tattoo. i have always wanted one and i have never had the nerve to go and get one. i think it is going to hurt really bad but i think that i am finally ready for one. i have been looking at what kind i want and printed some out off the computer. i hope that they can do the one that i want. i guess i am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. today i have 3 classes left to go to. this being one of them. i have a hard time paying attention in this psychology class. i just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. all of my other classes are just 50 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. but i added this class so 3:30 was the only time that was left open. i had to take it. thinking about school, i am going to go home and take summer school at sfa. i feel that if i can get some credtis there and transfer them here that it might take some of the load off for next year. i already came with 6 hours but that isn't very many. i am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 2 years. i don't know what i will do if i don't. i guess i will just transfer back home and go to school there if i can't get in here. but i really want to prove that i can get in here. i am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. i read what i am supposed to and work the problems, but i just can't seem to learn the material. i'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. i have never gone a year without dancing. last year i was dancing 4-6 hours every week day and this is just strange. i don't excerise in any other way than that so i am starting to feel out of shape. dancing was my way to let everything out. i wasn't always as good as i wish that i could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that i was good at something. here i can't do that. i am just another person walking down the side walk. at home, in such a small town, everyone knew who i was. and here i think i know about 20 people at the most. none of my friends came here so it isn't like i really have a relase. i am going to go home this weekend, and i know it is kind of soon, but i really miss my boyfriend. maybe i am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. it might be best if i go home, i know mom and dad would like that a lot more. but i am tired of doing everything for my parents. i never did anything in high school for myself. mom and i got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life i was just trying to prove myself to her. she treated me like a child even last year, like i was still 12 and couldn't take care of myself. being an only child i was smothered by my parents and grandparents. i don't know. it was nice getting what i always wanted, but sometimes i wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. it's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. it doesn't work. besides, i get tired of writing all of that down. i am super duper hungry right now buti don't want to eat because i am really afraid of the freshman 15. i haven't been eating well lately. i won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when i actually do eat, it isn't anything healthy. the only good we have in our room is gronola bars and froot loops. like that is healthy. at least i have been drinking a lot of water. well, my time to write is almost up. thank god because i am really getting tired sitting here and doing this. also, i have a class in 15 minutes and i really need to leave and go there. so, i guess i have a couple more of these things to do during the rest of the semester. fun fun fun, i can't wait.

"wow i'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that i'm listening to some allman bros. very loud as well as the st. louis ' denver game in the background but what the hell why not. i was thinking about what the hell i was going to write about earlier and i guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness. ha. well anyway i probably should not stop writing. it's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body (especially your hands) because sometimes i will think of something and begin typing it and then i will forget what in the hell i was thinking about until it's too late. the same thing even happens in conversations, and that sucks a big fat hairy one when i'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing i was watching last night and then i will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth. hmm it's very tempting to get lost in watching that clock in the upper portion of the screen. i keep seeing it tick away the seconds and it makes me want to look at it. i find all of this internet stuff veryu fascinating, especially since i am fairly proficient in it. wow, this feels almost like an inner monologue because deep down in the back of my consciousness i know that i will be the only one reading it, so i get almost this pointless feeling to myself as to why in the world i am even putting forth any effort into doing such an assignment. hmm that was the third time i have corrected my spelling. i wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment. typing is such a weird thing. i do it so much that i feel fairly proficient, but i was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers. how does one get through life in any situation where he'she only types with two fingers. i just thought about what an ass i was last night. i was supposed to go to see keller williams with a fairly attractive, but fairly annoying and fairly commonly high girl a few floors up, but i felt really sick yesterday and the rain made me extremely lazy, so i told her in no uncertain terms that we probably wouldn't go to the concert even though that's all we had talked about the week before. i'm such a jackass ' loser when it comes to relations with the ladies. i don't know what in the hell that last thing was, but oh well. wow i wonder what a handful of other people i know here and at lsu are doing at this exact second? hmm eight minutes and thirty seconds. the death knell tolls in the background. as does every hungry woman off of the allman bros. ' first and self titles release. wow, i will type anything to keep the flow going. the only other time i can think of stream of consciousness in my real world experience is a brief relation in the sixth sense when that little haley joel kid writes down every and any bad word imaginable and that terribly boring and lifeless novel i had to read in 8th grade called the reivers. i can't think of the author right now, just because if i sat and thought i'd stop typing and that would defeat the whole purpose of this excercise. hmm president bush is on tv right now. how sad it is that people criticize him constantly. what a load of hypocritical, cynical assholes. wow, now i really feel like that little shit in the sixth sense as i constantly am using bad language. what a sad world i live in vocabularily (if that is even a word) if all i can do is cuss in a paper. i guess that's not all that i'm doing, but it is a lot of what i'm doing. wow, that was a complete waste of a sentence. as was that one. and that one. wow i could go on for hours like this. i don't think i have misspelled very many words so far. wow, i deserve a cookie. what a sad statement. this paper is riddled with psychological buzz words and phrases. what a head-case am i. ok, yoda, enough. speaking of yoda, jay and silent bob strike back was one funny, yet dissapointing movie. i don't know why i chose that one out of kevin smith's entire repituare (that is most definately not spelled correctly), seeing as mallrats, chasing amy, and clerks were fairly brilliant, and dogma was exceptionally interesting although quite blasphemous, but i guess that's why i was so let down by j&sb strike back. it's funny how your mind jumps from one idea to another. i was just thinking about when i could go back home and see the folks. for some reason, i only get homesick and depressed when i am severly screwed up, which is possible, i guess, because i can see more clearly, i don't know. and by screwed up i don't mean on heroin or crack which some may need to believe. i'd never do that hard shit (i think the bad language is necessary there, eh?) eh, what the hell am i, canadian. wait, no, canadian. i don't think they deserve a capital c. well, they get a lot of flack for no reason. so i guess i can say canadian. there, was that so hard. yes. more inner monologue. uggggh. 1. 5 minutes left. this is an exceptionally long feeling. i just got finished (before i started into this thing) reformatting and reinstalling windows xp on my suitemate's laptop. i enjoy doing crap like that. ever since i've been here it seems like there aren't very many computer proficient people like back in louisiana. oh well. time's almmost up. yep, time she is a up. we'll delve into this more deeply next week (by the way, that was something about mary. ).

"where do i start? it's funny how when you are actually telling yourself that you need to think of something that things like pink bunny rabbits come to mind. why? right now, i'm trying to reorganize my mp3 collection. i thought that if i added a few new categories like 80s, 90s, country, comedy, etc. , that it would be easier to find what i'm looking for when there is something particular i want to hear. i'm usually in an upbeat mood, especially when i have something to do (like school), so i like to listen to upbeat music. but there are times when only slow music like u2's ""achtung baby"" album, or other slower music from the 80s. when i like to listen to these slow songs, it's not like i'm in a depressed mood or anything, it's just that i'm thinking about something intensely personal, i guess. i know that when i was breaking up with my last girlfriend, i listened to this music a great deal. it also helps me to be creative. i have a tendency to write things like poems or short stories when i'm in that mood. so, question. do i have to have a thoughtful demeanor in order to listen to the slow songs, or does listening to that particular kind of music put my mind into a creative thinking mode? grin and bear it. i'm a little intimidated by the amount of students i've come into contact with at this university. 50,000 people crammed into a fairly confined land space can make one feel claustrophobic. i like it, though, because everyone here is my age. there is an endless supply of new friends, new faces, new experiences, new situations. i could say that it's advantage of being so big is also a disadvantage. i've been to my psychology and english classes a couple of times and have yet to see the same face twice in each. i don't know anyone in this city, so it makes adjustment a little hard. my family has moved around quite a bit, so it's not that i'm not used to being new to something, i just wished i had my best friend here to share it with. andy. big guy. sings. just like me. likes the same music. likes the same movies. likes the same people i do, except when it comes to women. he disapproves of a great deal of my girlfriends. the few that he does like, i seem to like more, too. strange, though, how those are the ones that move away or want to see other people. i'm hot. my air conditioner hasn't been working these past few days and the apartment people say that they're ""on it. "" whatever. some tenants left a note on the manager's office door (the manager has conveniently not been in, either), saying some pretty mean stuff. i think it's funny, but at the same time i try to put myself in the shoes of the manager. she has many things to think about, i'm sure, but still. 110 on the thermometer is no laughing matter, especially for someone who's not from around here. not used to the heat. my bike needs to be adjusted. it doesn't shift gears the way it should. up shifting seems to work fine, but when i down shift, the chain doesn't move crisply. i need to find a new seat, too. maybe one with a little more padding. i hope the interview with compaq goes well. not only is it a big company that would give me lots of opportunities, but george lucas. i want to work for george lucas.

"sometimes i think of what other people are thinking. i watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. they must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. i don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. i feel strange in the fact that i am putting my thoughts into words. though i am concentrating on writing, i am also able to let my mind wander while i write. the way i think and the way i process my thoughts has changed since i've been in college. leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which i desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that i have at home. my life in austin is good, but it is missing all those people that i made such a major part of my life. i wonder if those people will ever be there again. my family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. my friends and my boyfriend are the ones that i spent ever spare moment with. now that i am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. i always travel back in time, in my head, to the days i spent with them. every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times i had with them. maybe they are thinking the same way. i can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. my mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but i have yet to see what she is talking about. my mother is great. now i realize all the things she has done for me. she was always there for me, and even now that i am hundreds of miles away, she still there. i was distracted by the distant voices behind me. they seem to be discussing a project. some kind of stress has been put on this group. i am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. stress is one thing that i cannot deal with. when i stress i start to think a lot. when i think, i get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that i no longer can do the things i used to do in the past. some people beside me are also using the computer. their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that i am writing about them. if i were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. i can always feel someone looking at me. even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes i can see someone look. even when i don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. after this writing assignment is finished, i have to drive through austin's traffic to get home. that is the only thing i can't stand about going home. what should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. things like that frustrate me. the light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. i have a feeling that austin is going to be just like houston, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. it is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. after that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again.

"i wonder if he is thinking of me???? i am glad i am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now. i need to do all this as soon as i get it. i had done this before but i could not submit it. i have something special with alex and i know how he feels and he is different. he isn't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me. i hope not to hurt him. i need him and need someone like that. someone to take care of me and to be there for me if i need to talk someone to talk to me and someone that i can take care of and love too. he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful. he will never know i guess. he is there for me when i most needed him. he has held me when i cried and has made me laugh when i was sad' i owe a lot to him. we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun. i wonder if he knows how much fun i have had with him. i don't think he understands. i am going through a hard time and i am going through a big transition, but i think i am doing fairly well. i have not cried much. my roommate went home this weekend and i felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with. we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other. we are okay now. my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too. i don't want to be with him anymore, yet he still persists. he know that i am dating alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with. i want to get away from that i am tired of having to answer questions about my own life. i want to be free and to be able to do what i want and that i think is right not what other people think i should do. it isn't fair to me if i have to make someone else happy before i could do things for my own freedom. it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply can't be an individual. there are many things to do here in austin and many many people to meet and make friends with. i have had a good time so far and i have enjoyed going to class and learning. although i do think that i should read a little more. i will be fine though. claudia and alex will be there if i need anything.

"okay. so i need to write what's on my mind. right now all i can think of is that chemistry test i just took at 9:30am this morning. it was my first test in college i was scared as hell before i took it because i was scared i would run into problems i didn't know how to workout and i would not pass the test. now i'm sitting in anxiety for the results. i keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. i have butterflies in my stomach. i'm trying almost anything i can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. goodness i feel so behind in my classes and i don't know why i mean i have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and i got time to relax, but can't. again that stupid test is on my mind. why does it torture me so? i'm sitting here praying i will get an 'a' on it because i gave it the best shot i could have even if i had studied continuously the whole week, i wouldn't have been able to do better. i guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. the entire thing was a review for me from chemistry ii my junior year. my stomach is in huge knots and i feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and i don't like it. those warning signs usually mean i'm in trouble for something, but i don't know why yet why i could be in trouble. i hate not knowing things. it makes me feel so vulnerable and i hate being put on a spot like that. my gosh i hope i didn't fail the test, otherwise i'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. i just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. i wish i could relax right now. maybe i'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as i'm through typing this assignment i still have 9 more minutes according to the clock. man, i really hope i run into siddharth today again that boy is really cute! but one thing puzzles me does alvin like me? he always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us bull crap they will! i think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. man! that test, but it's not that anymore i feel like i'm in trouble and i don't know why is everything okay at home? i sure do hope so. why do i concern my self so much everything will be okay no? hey! need to write my cousins i really don't feel like writing sonu now, i'll write him over the weekend when i go home. man i've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 20 minutes are over i hope this assignment is long enough i don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind i've never done that i've always had to think what i write and it's terrifying because any minute i feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and i'll get a zero.

"i keep coughing so much in class i think i probably annoy the crap out o everybody there. i should stop smoking so much. it feels good to be back in school, seeing friends again, but i miss my mom. she is wittiog all the way in ethiopia and i'm over here. it sucks. but there is always christmas time, so it is not that bad. i have no idea what that holiday is going to be like. this guy just bumped in to me an did not even apologize. i hate it when people do that. he just walks by like it's okay to knock people into a damn computer screen. jerk. i don't understand how i am going to keep writing for twenty minutes. the way i type it will probably be the worst thing anyone has ever read. i tend to type fast and then screw up a lot along the way. there is a guy near me talking a bout the swiss air crash and jerry mcguire. i hate baseball so i couldn't care less. there goes my cough again. i got to get home soon, i got a date. this is really a nice girl and i hope it works out, but i will probably spend the hold time coughing anyway. the guy is now talking about wire services. what in the world are wire services. i am getting kind of thirsty and i should get a drink of water, but i do not know where the water fountains in this library are. i hate asking people about it, i guess i feel stupid. i wonder what the guys who read this stuff do. do they analyze it of just laugh at the kind of things people come up with. i would probably laugh a lot. if this was me reading it i would be cracking up. then a gain i am kind of a jerk. what i don't understated about the internet is how people think its so much phone. i like e mail and research its great. but this whole surfing the web for hours like its some sort of athletic event seems kinds stupid. i thinks i sound like some commercial i saw. its amazing how tv effects you like that. you watch some stupid ditcom and then start using the vocab all over the palace. it hate the people who keep going yadda yadda because of seinfeld. but then again i pick up enough catch [phrases anyway. i just looked at the watch, another ten minutes of writing. this is really weird. this is the first psych class i have taken and so far i enjoyed it. this is a different kind of activity. i have difficulty understanding how this helps us learn anything, but then again i am cynical by nature. the prof was talking about the brain today and it was really technical i thought the class would not be like that. not that i mind or i did not understand it, it was just a surprise. somebody once told that psych classes are some of the most fun, i hope he is right. i don't see much of him anymore, he got married and has kids. so his life really changes. he's like my brother, wee used to hang out and drink beer all the time and go to games and stuff like that. now he only wants to take his baby to the children's museum and do family things. i love the kid, but i miss the old him who would drive off to new orleans on a whim because he wanted a sandwich form a particular cafe. it's funny who people change. i' feel i have changed in college. i would not say i grew up, i just found out things about myself that i would not have ordinarily known like what it's like to be away form all the comforts of home and how i would handle it. or to be away form africa and in america again. i kind of glorified it but it did not turn out that way. i hope that december comes so, i am looking forward to all my friends and my parent, an my dog . i want to get a dog hear but the apt does not allow it so i guess i am stuck. my place is too small anyway. i have not really seen that many apt in austin that allow pets. but i am sure there a lot. hey that girl is really cute.

"so i have twenty minutes to write about what i think. i was thinking of all the things i thought i would write earlier, but suddenly i'm drawing a blank. i think i'm going to stop trying to write properly because there's really no point. after all, i'm supposed to write what i'm thinking, and if i get to caught up in punctuation i don't think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if i was not' typing at all. nick lachey is pretty swoll, and a pretty good singer. jessica simpson can look hot, but at times she looks rather plain. there are a lot of plain looking girls here, somewhat of a disappointment. isn't college suppose to have a lot of hot girls? o well, i have a girlfriend, so it really shouldn't matter. i remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 7 seconds or something like that, and it looks like i'm get to that subject pretty soon. i like timberland. he consistently makes good beats. but magoo fell off on the last single i heard from them. what's the name of that single? i think its one and all. i turned off the music because i don't think as randomly as usually do when its on. its like i focus on the music and that is all exists. maybe that is y i could be a good dj if i tried, but i never practice, and that's why omar's upset wit me. i hope he is doing alright now. he says he is, but i know he is still tripping, at least every now and then. man, i told him not to trip on emmi, but what he don't know is that i trip on her too. that is pretty fucked up, but i can't help it. as erin said, that girl's seductive. and she really is seductive. i wonder why. she is not that hot, and i see a lot of flaws when i look at her, but i still want to get with that. maybe its just lust. now that i think of it, it is mostly lust. but i would never mistreat her. well, i don't think i would mistreat her. i thought i would never cheat on my girlfriend, but look what i did in cancun. i can really trust my boys--everytime i got a dirty secret, they shut they mouth. its' not cool that i have such a big mouth. i been saying i need to work on it, and i think i'm finally getting there. now that i'm controlling this part of my personality, maybe i can control my hormones as well. but i'm 18, and everyone says they know what i mean when i tell them wussup. felix agreed with me, even hazel. life savers kickers are pretty damn good. i'm tripping, thinking bout emmi again. i don't know why i'm so infatuated wit her. but its not that strong of an infatuation. not like it was wit crystal. when i saw her at the omega talent show, i still thought she was fly. and i say she is a stuck up bitch, but i know if she honestly wanted to date i wouldn't think twice. i wish i was like those cats that know how to pull any girl. i'm starting to realize its a game, and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life. i need to stop thinking bout other girls. i have a gf. just like i need to stop chatting on aim because all it does is keep my from doing my work. i'm getting sleepy. the fire alarm went off again. i wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls. well, i guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day. i'm getting sleepy. i wonder if i meet jaymee ong if i'd actually have the nerves to approach her. probably not, unless i was famous like her. and even then, i don't know if i would. probably if i was drunk i'd do it. hahah. i wonder if i'll have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho. there i got thinking bout other girls again. and here i go getting sleepy. every time i take my eyes off the monitor i get sleepy my fingers are starting to get a bit tired. this is the first assignment i've had that requires me to think about what to think about. man, chatting online never makes me sleepy, but its the exact same thing i'm doing now. sa was right. it is all in my head. if i could control every aspect of my behavior, that would work to my advantage. no more fallen asleep wen i have to read for class, or falling asleep on the road. maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate. but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and esp. i think semi just sent me a text message, but i only got a minute left, so i'll wait till i'm done with this before i see what she said. i want to sing. if i could sing, i would rule the world hahaha. maybe not, but i'd feel like king. right now, that is wut i want most in life ",0,1.083437 0.490191 0.045833 0.156585 0.870708 -0.942012 -0.730525 -0.692797 -0.822938 1.034027 -0.186995 -0.212914 -1.070467 -0.42504 -0.658923 0.0 -0.04277 0.854384 0.801871 -0.795527 0.631807 -0.576652 0.733218 0.883333 0.144423 -0.280567 -0.586688 -0.483905 -1.300198 -0.59904 -0.8489 0.532874 -1.223731 -0.311404 -0.209392 -0.840813 2.707723 -0.713805 1.75248 2.16024 3.025969 -0.006257 0.034278 0.760123 1.786256 0.731739 -0.875241 0.004777 0.487224 0.072478 0.632423 -0.508243 0.23139 0.013054 -1.24553 -0.281618 0.574479 0.863237 -1.463673 0.937896 -0.850537 0.555812 -0.480161 0.425098 0.32618 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.318838 0.852803 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.213345 -0.37208 -0.030451 -0.422267 0.74325 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.616032 5.051741 3.485446 4.65611 4.99649 5.065939,1913
"my chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. i find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. i have come to the realization that indian producer people truly are strange. this realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. i mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. the people upstairs just made another random noise. it sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. i'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since i don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. i really don't know what they do upstairs. the people next door to us are just as strange. they screen their phone calls i think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. but then i hear them in their room. actually, i'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. we've gotten some random phone calls. some of these calls came from people i know very well and yet i can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. i just realized that i have very random thoughts; i think that this means that i'm not really focused on what i'm doing or something. actually, i'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. i just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. that is quite sad; generally i always have something that i can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. yet when i'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. i wonder when i'm going to get rid of my cough. i refuse to take cough syrup because i don't like the taste of it, and so i'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. i don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. that would most definitely not be a good thing. i guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. at least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. grape is a good flavor. chocolate is a good flavor too. i like chocolate. actually i like all sugar; i think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar i intake daily is what causes my oddness. but sugar is good nevertheless. so is chocolate. i don't think it causes acne. how can something that tastes so good be so bad? of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, italian food, etc). ah well. i never knew twenty minutes could last so long. it's neverending. i feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. there was just another random thud from the people next door. i think they must have dropped something plastic. i just realized that i don't really know any of the people who live around me. i think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. that's kind of sad, considering i hear from everyone that ""people who live on the same floor as you become your family"" and i don't really seem to sense that. we all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. that, to be honest, is the one thing i didn't like about ut. the fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. we all have our high school buddies. well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. if i had counted the number of times i hit the backspace button during this exercise, i think i would come up with this huge number. i never knew i'm so bad at typing; i have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet.

"life is ever changing. nothing remains the same yet, you keep everything with you. every good thing that has made you happy and every bad thing that has changed you in one-way or another. right now i miss him. i feel love and sorrow. lose for what we never found. why wasn't i the one. or instead, am i the one who he needs? i hate questions that keep me up at night. you tell yourself, ""go to sleep. you have a big day ahead of you"" but does your mind pay any attention to what your body needs? no, never. so, i find myself wondering what he is doing and what he is thinking. is he okay? not caring if he is with someone else, just wishing him happiness. i hate myself for being so nice. people use me and don't even bother to thank me for that. is that to much to ask, a simple ""thank you""? i am greatfull for lots of things. for my mother and father and grandmother. by the way i wish she were hear. sadness with a touch of happiness runs through my body as i think of her. as i think of when i was two years old and would help her clean the house. about all the days she made sure i went to school and did my homework. especially of the day she left us. the day she left me. i was running. i remember i wanted her and she couldn't say anything. all i wanted was to say ""thank you"" for all the love she showed me. i guess that is why i say thank you for everything now. i should have told her that she ment everything to me. well, i did, but i don't know if she heard me. it is because of her i am who i am today. not only that, it is because of her that i am here. the world should be a better place. not for anyone in particular. no, just everyone. people should be happy with who they are inside. if not, than it is difficult to reveal yourself to anyone. how many people do you know that became who they are or accomplished what they have by being true to themeselves? i don't know many. sure, i'm only 18, (well 19 next week) but life has not been easy to me either. when i think of my childhood i don't have fond memories. most people i know would easily go back to the days they had no worries as children. well, not i. i hated being a child. even then everyone took control of me. starting at the age of six my brother sexually abused me. can you imagine that? my own brother. sure, i forgave him, but he wasn't the last. i don't remember how many people messed with me as a child, i try my best not to think of that time-period. though i do remember that i wanted to be better a better person when i grew up. i wanted to leave and never return to the pain. now i am strong. stronger than what most percieve me to be. i love everyone despit the fact people are harmful. i trust everyone despite the fact people are decietful. most importantly, i am happy. though i do miss holding him:) ",1,-0.481088 0.827859 0.951351 0.847341 1.077846 -0.618542 -0.357129 -0.148268 -0.020102 -0.374607 -0.232107 0.605071 0.305644 1.773143 -0.553222 0.0 -0.04277 2.352591 0.418704 -0.232898 0.379048 3.630444 1.810036 2.352125 0.009638 -0.285886 -0.55291 -0.00746 2.120298 2.46879 2.630263 0.998112 0.415667 -0.415697 0.315541 0.662021 0.686301 0.113583 0.124556 0.440539 0.301985 -0.720661 1.108593 0.081924 -1.050712 0.957988 0.346253 3.148256 0.463091 3.456357 1.917488 0.008739 0.909755 0.381423 -0.700074 -1.794568 -1.170245 -0.954251 -1.722303 -0.240072 -0.399947 1.599922 -0.480161 1.184873 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.853014 0.251278 0.098197 -0.23436 1.343917 -0.37208 0.16862 2.044096 -0.730351 0.622799 0.22601 0.735674 5.43868 4.557426 4.179584 5.221179 4.947793,901
"i feel that i have so much to do in the next few days. college is so overrated. the few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time, or do whatever it is that you like doing, equal all the other times you are reading, reading, studying, or doing other school stuff. i had a french vanilla cappuccino at like 9:30 tonight and it gave me so much energy that i can't sit and focus on one thing. it seems that i have been procrastinating all night. oooh all that i need is you (so the song i am listening to right now) but anyways. now i don't remember what i was thinking about a moment ago. it must be that caffeine i'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 48 hours. o no. i'm not really sure what i just did. i hit tab because that's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead. so instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 20 minutes i think it was more like 2 so now i'm thinking about how i need to get in contact with the ta or the professor and explain how i will probably have two submissions but i'm not really sure because i don't know how computers work. they are so complex. i don't really understand them. like earlier i couldn't log into the prescreening experimental stuff. i have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because i don't really trust them. i'm very skeptical of them. i feel like if i start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it. like just now, i'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise. the song i'm listening to is sung by a different group, but the same song i did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing. during a heavy practice time i had mono i remember. kind of a cool time because i got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasn't fun but i did get to know my teachers well that year. i wonder how the other two girls that i did the trio with are doing. they are both a year older than me so they've been doing this whole college thing longer. speaking of long i just looked at the time and i've only been doing this for like five minutes. looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever i made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didn't. i actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend. she is a choreographer for a dance team i was interested in trying out for, but i decided not too because it brought back to many memories. i am thinking about trying out for steel dance this weekend but i don't know yet. o yaw that reminds me that i need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because i really don't want to wear pink tights and a black leotard. it makes me feel fat. which reminds me i never ate dinner tonight and its like 110. i guess all the julius chips and salsa i ate will have to do. thank goodness for julio. he makes some awesome chips. i wonder who julio is. or even if julio is still alive. my roommate brought his chips back from del rio. my hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories. i think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so i definitely will remember that one. o look more remember things. i guess the hippo thing is working right now. the song i'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team. rachel and shea. they were awesome dancers. i wonder where they are now. there is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks. actually shea has a pair of my comfy pants that i loved that my friend brittney had on tonight. shea is in utah so i don't think i will ever see them again. speaking of comfy clothes i wonder why all i wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt. it must be that whole college thing. o no. here goes again. that whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when i didn't even click on the program. this computer is so random. maybe i just need to update the aim program. but then again i don't know that much about computers so i'm not really sure how i'd go about doing that. with my luck i'd probably download some computer virus with it too. and viruses. that thing about getting sick when you are most stressed. i will probably be getting sick soon because i am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project. which didn't go exactly how i hoped but its over so i don't want to think about it. if i say i am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick? that is something else we learned about. if you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it. o man i don't remember the name of it. i am really going to have to study for this test. i should probably start this weekend. well there is one more thing to add to my to do list. i started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer. i need to add that i need to talk to a ta for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before i forget. my 20 minutes is up now its a good thing i ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing i will remember. now i really like this song. its from 13 going on 30 that movie. i have started watching more movies since i got to college i think that is what i will ask for for my birthday-movies. o yaw my time is up. i need to get ready for bed so maybe i will get a decent amount of sleep tonight.

"this is really boring, i'm so tired, i think i might take a nap after this but i have to write my social work notes. i wonder what will is doing in his class right now, i think this exercise will show that i think about him too much. i wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message i sent to her cell phone? should i go home this weekend? if i go home, i think i'll want to stay there, but if i don't go home i'll miss seeing my lil brother and i know he really wants to see me, its a good thing i haven't told him i'm thinking about it yet. i really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. i wonder if by getting him tickets i'm encouraging him to ditch class. i don't want to encourage him to do that, i want him to do well more than anything because i know that he wants out of utsa so bad. i hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, i type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. i wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. i guess it is keeping me awake. i'm so tired, i just want to sleep once in awhile. i actually did sleep last night, i only woke up once i think. its so hard to sleep, i don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. i was so tired that i took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, i think he might be one of the best people i know. i wish more guys were like russ. i wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. i wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. i wish i could make more friends too. oh, i made a friend today in sociology. i let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. i hope i don't do that, but since i have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, i feel like such a pathetic loser here. i have friends, i really do, i keep telling myself this. but i don't think anyone here believes me. i walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when i have to. its such a pathetic existence. then i come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. i talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. i wish they were here. i hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. i wonder how he is. i hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. i think he probably does miss having everyone around. i wonder if marc is ok. i think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person i know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, i wish i was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. i think i was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. i was never like the prom queen or anything, but i had about a ton of friends, and i knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. i miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, i want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl i don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, i was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. i felt kinda bad for ditching the yl ppl, but i think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. i don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. i don't know, i tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. i can't believe his mom thought we were. i can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, i wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. i wonder where that frame i made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. i'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. i really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that i want him to get out of utsa and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. i wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. i hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together i think. i can't believe that i miss everyone so much, and i can't believe that i care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. i wonder how he is. i can't believe he had a girlfriend. i wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is i'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. i'm not understanding that. i wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? i can't believe she would smoke. i bet she couldn't believe i would drink. why does armando think i would give it up to will. i may like the guy, but that doesn't mean i want to jump in a bed with him. i hope he was just kidding. i wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. i hope that doesn't happen to will, i hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too i'm sure if he pushes me. i hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave utsa so that he doesn't ruin will. i hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. i know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would i do if he died and i was the last one to talk to him, and i knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? i would feel guilty. but there's nothing i could do about it. i couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well i don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? i know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. i convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. i think i handle it better. i don't know that running away to san antonio to see him'everyone is better, but at least i'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo ",1,-0.554519 0.326982 0.00411 0.67646 0.964012 -1.417699 -1.157589 -1.236512 -1.366799 3.112899 -0.185112 0.253448 -2.256634 0.154788 -1.264141 0.0 -0.04277 1.489328 0.047588 0.28341 0.126529 -0.742368 2.572683 -0.691809 0.105073 -1.075255 -0.661038 -0.673367 0.587385 0.281855 0.33054 1.053391 0.566814 -0.717969 -0.250795 0.758947 1.314606 -0.606321 1.938826 1.519017 -0.267413 0.450165 -0.847754 -0.527213 -0.557785 -0.104031 -0.541298 1.430757 -0.165327 2.025515 0.360335 -1.312228 0.389886 0.795218 1.081262 0.178984 -0.904719 -0.092039 0.304889 0.772354 0.717938 -0.645544 -0.276792 -0.560139 0.005374 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.215433 1.179601 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.265495 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.176668 -0.451544 -0.287042 0.518562 5.283709 3.96101 4.761583 5.097332 4.937406,2184

"" tonight family is coming in, can't wait, a nice paid for meal. lately i've been feeling sad. i parted from my 2 best friends a month ago to be here and now i can see how much i really depended on them. my life is so different. i have to try and fit into the friendships that were already made here this summer during provisionals. it's not fun. they're all in the sorority and i'm sick of going out every night. i talked to my best friends amy and christa everyday either on the phone or internet. i don't know what i'd do without aim. i miss them so much. i'm going home this weekend i need to see some familiar faces. i'm not one to be homesick i just feel i have no sort of comfort zone here even though i should. i mean my brother lives here but has his own life with his job and girlfriend. so i barely get to see him ever. i've been really sad the past 2 weeks. it's just been really hard. my boyfriend of 8 months is in the marines and lives in 29 palms, california. he doesn't get much time off with his new duties that he was promoted to so he had 96 hours off during labor day weekend and drove 1600miles to see me. i can't even believe it still, that 21hour drive had to be horrible. that's what keeps me going everyday. how much i can see by the way he's shown me, how much he cares and loves me that he would come all the way here. he finally bought a cell phone so we could talk easier instead of him waiting in the 2hour phone lines they have at the payphones everyday. he's also getting a job for his days off at a western wear store. he wants more money, he's so responsible, as if being in the marines isn't hard enough work already. its really expensive with all the gas to drive here all they time and the flights are just crazy. i'm going to try and fly there for his birthday. i know my parents would absolutely kill me. i love him so much and we're of different religions so almost for a year now i've had to deal with my parents. i can't stand it, its drives me crazy inside sometimes how disapproving they are of someone they won't even get to know. it's not fair to me. they should be happy as long as he makes me happy. i would never not be with someone because of a religion that they were born into. not to mention, the fact that we're both not deeply committed to our religions or were brought up that way. i can feel the tension and hurt coming up in the future. when he gets out we will be very close. he'll go to southwest and we'll be together everyday, hopefully for the rest of our lives. i don't know, its just one more thing added on to my stress factors. sometimes it's just easier to cry it all out but when i let that happen sometimes it lasts for almost 24 hours straight and i make myself sick. i've been sick all week and i hate it. i should be studying and i can't focus or keep myself to concentrate. i have to learn. i have to stick with it. i've decided i'm not going to go out at night unless it's a big function that i care about. it's not worth it. the party scene is old. i've been coming up to austin the past 4 years for the big parties, pat o's, atlantic city, and they just don't do anything for me anymore. i guess that would probably be because i don't drink and i don't' care to ""hook up"" with anyone so basically since those are the 2 main reasons that those fraternities have parties, they really just don't interest me. i'm personally fine with going to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends and renting a sappy movie and eating a lot of junk food. but that's just me. something i do love here though is that i don't shower to go to class, don't get dressed up nor have i touched my make up bag since i left home. how fun is that? i love it. i just really don't care. basically my plan is to try and focus on my studies, i won't have any boys here to distract me cause the only one i love isn't here. i'll do well in school and in the end we'll be able to be together. he has about 1 year and 10months left, but i figure i can make it. i mean he's already been in there for 2yrs and 2months and i've stood by his side the entire time, even before he joined. he means the world to me. i just can't even imagine my life without him and that's why i plan on staying with him. i know people think i'm dumb, that i'm wasting my college years staying committed to a long distance relationship, but i don't know why it would be dumb. as long as i'm happy why should i care right? i don't know, this whole college thing is really going to take some getting used to. i mean, me, doing my own laundry? that's just funny.

"my first reaction to this assignment was to just write that i felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 20 minutes; however, i am interested in where this is going. right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how i can touch-type and he cannot. the other day, we went to go and buy fish. we drove around austin i don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. we drove to highlands mall, lakeline mall, petsmart, and petco. i finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. it really upset me that out of the 4 fish that i bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment i previously had. the sole fish that i possessed in that tank ate all of the food i would drop into the tank continuously. it really began to bother me when i saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. so, i took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. i understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. i knew that i was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. well, i finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so i eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. i am really suprised that i did this because i am such a humanitarian. for example, whenever my other fish would die, i would get other people to remove them from the tank because i couldn't deal with the dead fish. i always felt as though they were looking at me. there is one instance where i did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. i don't know, i think i have always had such a problem with death. it scares me, but it doesn't. for example, i used to work at a hospital in san antonio, when i was a junior in high school. this is where i had my first real encounter with death. i never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. however, since then i have had to deal with it several times. i guess i take that back, i have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. i can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. and i know this sounds corney, but every single time i have had to deal with death since then, i have seen a little yellow butterfly. this spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 5 or 6 occasions. well, my 20 minutes is up.

" usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""how am i going to do it? where do i start? where do i finish? how do i know that i am doing it right?"" this is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. i can't wait till saturday because i will attend the first ut football game this season, which i might add, will be my first time to attend one. the weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when i was up here for summer school. its a real drag. i'm always so tired i hate it. labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. maybe i'll go visit brett (an el paso friend) at the hidious a & m, college station, the drive is a drag though. the road trip that me and lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. all they're concerned about is putting ut down or ""tu"" as they call us since we're not ""the"" university of texas but ""a"" texas university! isn't it stupid. still admit i'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. they do have a lot of school spirit. makes me wish that i was into that stuff. who knows, maybe when all the football games start. i want to see how crazy us longhorns really get. i can't wait till softball games start, i want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!! hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, i will be ready to try out. i'm really discouraged about trying out this year, i know i'm not ready. my family's encouragement helps but i don't want to make a fool out of myself. i can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a ut uniform. how amazing. that is my goal!! if i can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't i have a shot on the team. i just think that i lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. it may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. i love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. i love it. there are a lot more responsibilities though, but i'm picking up on the time management. the incubus concert is coming up and i'm (since yesterday) going. i've only heard a few songs by them so i can't say that i'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. but hey i'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. i should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. its worth the experience.

"i am bored, i don't know what to write. i think that i am going to enjoy college. i miss my friends and family from back home, but i am starting to mak new friends here. i will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. if i do go, i want to make sure that i will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that i went i didn't really get mush time to sleep, so i was pretty tired on my way back. i have been tired all week long now. i went to bed after midnight last night and then i had to get up this morning at five so that i could go do the pt test for the airforc rotc. we didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. i wish that we could have worked out too. i really hate it while i am doing it, but afterwards i feel pretty good. tuesday, when i got done with my pt test, i started throwing up on the field. i was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when i had to start the two mile run. my time for the run went up a minute. i will try to get that back down. i want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. i want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. but i care more about those than the run. i need to make up an excercise schedule for the rotc. i don't really know when i want to do everything. i will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. since i have to wake up at five on tuesdays and thursdays, i usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. i will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, i will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. that should be plenty of excercise. i will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. i wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but i barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. i think that i will like it in the air force. it doesn't look like i had thought that it would be. they were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on tv. it looks a little more respectable that the army. i hope that i will like it. on tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. i want to find out what they had to do to get them. someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 gpa. i'll bet that there is more to it than that. but i want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. if i have to get a loan, it will look better. it will also make me more elligible for scholorships. i am going to need the money. next year, i think that i will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. i think that i would like that more than living in a dorm. it is too noisy here. my roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and i always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. i know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when i am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, i just want to scream. but next year i will have my own place by myself. that will be nice. the only problem will be that i will have to cook for myself. i don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. that probably won't be very nourishing. i will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. maybe melinda and i could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while i go to school. she could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. but i don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. i would really like to help her out, but i don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that i helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. it was very irritating, also. still, she is a very good friend that i know will always care for me. she is very nice. i just don't think that she is very good handling money. but not everyone is good at that. she is very good with kids, and i'm not very good with them at all myself. i never know what to say to them. i start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, i run out of stuff to say. my cousin dillian liked me pretty much though. my mother was telling me about how he was so excited that i always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. but i was pretty bored when i was watching him. i couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. it wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour.

"it is 4:59 and i have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. i can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that i am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that i will only be graded for the fact that i did it and not examined for the content of my mind. does everyone hold their mind as sacred? i can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way i guess i am somewhat obsessive'compulsive. it's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. this openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do i have to say? this 20 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who i am sometimes i think that's what life is about everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet i wish i had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. who doesn't want to be analyzed? who doesn't want to analyze? i know that i am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, ""voyeurs"". i had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. my friends considered themselves ""voyeurs"" and i had to admit that i am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions i only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. it strikes me as funny that i am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that i am talking to you to the extent that i can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? i was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. i thought again about how different i feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and i feel like i've written a lot. if i were a ta i would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as i read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and i would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. but perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are ""true to science"" yay! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. i am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet i cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? it has certainly given people (i've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. i don't discount science, i do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. it's a tough tough thing. of course 99% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous i can imagine. but as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? i have been asking a lot of questions! how defining of me! now i (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. i will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 3 minutes actually the time will be up. well love and life and craziness and all the things i thought i would end up saying are not surfacing here, although i think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? i think i remember once reading about oh shit i lost my train of thought oh yeah, i think it might have been carl jung (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. those few seconds that you pause when someone says ""mother"" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha ha! uhoh time's up. this has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words i was using. thank you very much.

"here i am sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts. i am thinking that i shouldn't worry about what to think. i am not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary, but then again i am no psychologist. whoa, change in thought. now i am thinking of england and of how i wish i could go there to see the sights and see a close friend who lives there. now i am sad because this reminds me of princess diana and of what a wonderful woman she was. i was truly saddened when i heard she died. she was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for a moment. she was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you. this sadness takes me to other places, i am now simultaneously thinking of a close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of aids. i am a christian and i have strong christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving a supposed loving god. sometimes i praise god for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why. i have always been a dreamer, setting my goals high, but sometimes i wonder if what i want to do with my life is right or if god wanted me to go off and become a minister. life is never simple but i just try to roll with the punches. a minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt. they try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out, but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much. at the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to a lesser degree of love then is possible. i want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly, but in reality i have been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again. whenever you go on a date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself. i think that is a huge crock of shit. i am a multi faceted person, i don't even know what being myself would be. is that the self that you express outwardly, where in my case i am jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very, very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring. sometimes i feel like i have all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give it to. i try not to dwell in these places for any significant amount of time. i think io like who i am, but its just that i really haven't figured that out completely yet. at first i didn't know what to write, but now i am glad we did this assignment. it is good to get your feelings out from inside when you don't want to tell anyone and you don't have a diary. bye-bye.

"like a paper boat that's filled with water and slowly sinking. i'm not sure how to describe my thoughts at this particular moment. my thoughts seem to roam from one thing to another in a split second without me actually aborting all the information. i guess what to say is that my thoughts are unorganized like my backpack, all scattered around in bits. what pops up in my mind as a thought is how i'm going to go home after my classes are over for the day and check off the things that i remembered to do and those that i forgot to do. in my mind, all that i can see is my thoughts as a candy and it being surrounded by a mob of ants. my feelings at this moments are being jumpy and nervous at anything i see. i can't seem to calm myself. i also feel out of place and not all there, really unprepared. i guess to say is that i feel like i'm on a roller coaster ride and all alone on it. my sensations are at this moment very glad that the day is almost over and excited about hurrying home. my sensation at this moment also indicate anxiety for the next day and a sign of relief. that i can take a deep breath instead of gulping down small ones.

"i am very frustrated with this computer. i am the most computer illiterate person, and for this day and age, that is no good. i want to check my e-mail but it is telling me my password is incorrect. i am famished right now. i have had this job on my mind all day. i really want to teach dancing but she wants me to teach tap along with ballet, jazz, and cheerleading. i am not the most qualified person to teach tap and i feel i would be doing my students a great injustice be teaching that class. also she has me working on saturdays and if i ever want to go home i will have to find a substitute teacher. this is going to take up a lot of my time and as a freshman i need to make the grades. especially around finals i will need time to study and that is when the studio is going to have a winter show. that means i would have to choreograph six dances and find music. but the thing is i really want to teach dancing like i did back home. this is such a hard decision because i already accepted the job and i feel bad backing out on sherri, the owner. i guess after writing all of this out there are more cons than pros. my friend chad is sitting next to me and he keeps asking me how to spell words. he is interrupting my train of thought. i love typing on computers i just don't know too much about them. i really want to check my e-mail. my dad me something and i would like to read it. i think i'm hungry for chinese food tonight. but chips and hotsauce sound so good. really i think i want italian. i can always eat italian food. i guess it is since i am almost 100% italian. the food a jester is really bad. i have been living off tuna and speghettios that i keep in my room. you know i think i'm going to quit my job that i just got two days ago. i really need to call her right now but i'm at the flawn, so i will do it when i get home. my arm is kind of hurting from typing. maybe i have carpal tunnel syndrome. just kidding. i was looking for the submit button but i'm not sure which one it is. i'll have to ask chad. he is my boyfriend and my best friend. i wasn't sure if i would want a boyfriend my first year of college, but right now i am glad i have him. i think a lot of it is we are more like friends most of the time. or really a lot like brother and sister. but i love him. well i have a lot of other homework and studying i can be doing so this is the end of my thoughts. well those will never end but this is the end of me recording them. bye!

"this semester should be one where i define the rest of my life. working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. it is what i have wanted to do for the past 5 years. the fact that i was initially rejected brought me down. but i can't let that hold me down. hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. my roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. i'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. i have known him for the past 2 years. i am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. i don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. i am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. hopefully something will come of it. if not there are about 20,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. i thought this was going to be easy but so far i just can't seem to talk about much. that it was i hate about myself is that i am too shy around people i don't know. people i don know think i am loud and very extroverted but around strangers i don't know how to initiate conversation. there are times though when i don't really care and i seem to make friends with everyone. i have a lot of reading to do but i thought i might as well get this out of the way. i used to do this type of thing in my 10th grade english classes. mr. wildman was so cool. my old high school wasn't very good. i guess that is why i only went there for 2 years. i bet there are about 2 million mistakes in this paper once i am done typing this. the psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. that is such a relief because i need to work as hard as i ever had in my entire life and i probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. i think that after this semester of busting my ass i t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 4. 0 over the next years will come natural. i believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. architecture is a field of tremendous work. i have worked with a guy for the past two years. it so good. i have learned more on the job than i think i will ever learn in any classroom. it was a job i was looking forward to going to every morning. he gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. i was able to organize the el paso independent school district fundraiser where i happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. how much longer do i need to type? this is lasting longer than i thought it would. i guess my head is just empty. i think while doing this i try to hard to put on this thing that i think you want to hear. but since it is just a free thought paper i should just be able to write whatever i want. but for some reason it just isn't happening. i think way too much about things that keep me up at night. i often lie in bed until 4 in the morning just thinking i will be in the next 10 years. i have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. i think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. just once to here my dad say, ""that's my son"" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what i have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. hopefully i went let him down that is why i come to class. that is why i have to college. this is why i am reading and turning this assignment in days early. i will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. if i don't i have not only let myself down but my parents as well. but i won't let that happen. this is the place an time to make or break my future and i don't plan i on coming away from the university with anything less then i what i came here for. i will be the best and i will make my parents proud. time is almost up i thin. i guess this has been good for me. even though no one will probably ever read this i know it has been a vent. these are things no one has ever heard me say. so take car of it. times up teach, talk to you later.

they are playing ou as i write this and i am hoping that they loose. i keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down i really want them to loose. when they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him? i know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. this makes me extremely jealous and insecure. adrian is my first love. he is the first person i ever really cared about. i don't know if i am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. there are so many more important things that i should be worrying about right now in my life. i am in my prime. i am terrified of getting hurt. i'm scared that i am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when i really need him. i can almost see history repeating itself: in high school i stood beside adrian when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where i needed someone there for me we was too good. i still have a tremendous amount of anger towards adrian for the things he did to hurt me. this relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but i'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that i would be willing to lay down my life for. i don't know if i am being insecure about our relationship because of things adrian has done in the past or because i feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like i am not worthy of someone liking me. ,1,0.205422 -0.597338 -0.529371 -0.229464 -0.347944 0.112965 0.565223 0.959751 0.473124 -1.33263 -0.087061 0.253448 0.70332 0.272591 -0.128817 0.0 -0.04277 0.865834 0.637248 0.21193 0.729418 -0.742368 1.886089 -0.7679 -0.624052 -0.711616 1.2585 -0.491961 2.577105 1.622361 1.126407 2.918543 2.004875 5.239969 1.36984 0.476583 0.335026 -0.912936 0.320812 0.929465 0.161629 -0.405575 -1.548301 -1.09235 -0.751204 -0.982939 0.19553 0.282443 -1.363783 1.525772 0.247225 0.115244 0.266988 -0.139086 -0.356968 0.227881 -0.41631 1.729384 2.183414 -0.312655 -1.020756 2.219932 -0.480161 0.982819 0.312539 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.635817 -1.364578 0.234084 -0.23436 -0.025351 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.923193 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.495113 5.133027 4.518914 4.723868 4.903933 4.865571,349
"i am very tired. actually i am not sure if i am tired or if i am just wanting to be tired. it almost seems strange but being tired is almost like a way out, or my ticket away from always having to be around people. i ma usually considered the very social one, whether it is with my friends or my family, but i have always been the one that should be so happy. i love country music. i remember that i used to listen to it all of the time when i was a freshman in high school. i think that i might have listened to it then because all of my new friends did and i wanted to be exactly like them. i also remember that barron used to listen to it. i guess it made me feel cooler when i could sing along to the songs in the car with everyone else. college is so weird and i miss my mom and dad so much. i got to see mom today and it was so great, and now i really want to cry. i wanted to cry when she left, and now that she is gone i want to cry even more. i am not going to cry though because if someone walked in here then it would take forever and they would never leave because they think that they have to, and that they can somehow make me feel better and stop missing my parents. lizzie looked so cute today. she is getting older way too fast. kind of reminds me of myself. she has a really bad temper though and i think that she got it from my mom. she is so damn smart though. i miss having that kid say weird things all of the time. making me laugh. i have had really weird dreams lately. i think that travis must be really tired i wonder if he really only does like me that much when he is drunk. i have words sometimes. sometimes i just really hate everything. i miss jenna being able to tell me to go to sleep and everything would be better the next day in high school. jenna has a new best friend now. seems like everyone always has a very best, closest friend and i never really have just one. i am usually best friends with the guys. i guess that jenna and i used to be inseparable very best friends, but being in san antonio will really tear two people apart. i really don't want to read my psychology. i want to read harry potter. i think that i almost make myself want to read because my mom loves it so much. i love my mom, and i miss going to camp. i need to stop missing things and take some of my advice to heart. i know what is right and wrong and i know the harsh facts of things coming and going in life. i wonder if the sophomore girls had fun this weekend while they were in austin. i think that that is pretty silly that they came up here for a whole weekend as a birthday party when they can't even go out, except to maybe like a movie. i wonder if austin is really crazy about kyle and i wonder if brad has ever thought about getting with or dating rachel perry. i miss high school. i miss my megaphone and my big blue bronco and being able to want to go to college. last night i had really good margaritas. they would have been so much better if the were frozen. i want to meet vince gill. i hope that someday king sings to me. i want to date king. not just get with him but date him. i always like one boy and try to date him and end up dating his best friend, but still wishing that i could date the other one. i wonder if king's girlfriend is really cute. julie is here. she is so much fun, she reminds me of jill clower but i seriously think that she is so much nicer than jill clower could have ever been. i really don't want to do this stupid assignment. i don't want to do this anymore. i could totally stop and come back and no one would ever know, but i am sure that there is some kind of point or something and i wonder if anyone is really going to ever read this i wonder how george magel is doing. that boy never really changed since 6th grade. there are two ways to write 6th on this computer. i had so much fun walking on sixth street the other night with tim. it would be really cool if he would call me. i really was looking forward to coming to college and making a best friend that would be in my wedding and move to new york with me for no reason, and do fun things like shop for fruit and flowers and watch old movies. i don't think that i have found my real best friend yet. i wonder if people really think that you only have one mate out there waiting for you. i wonder if that is true. no one could ever prove that. the only person who knows things like that is god. my dad is really close to god. i really do think that the closer you are to god the better your life is. you may not be famous, or always have the cutest clothes, but you will know what and who you love and what is important to you, and those few, simple things that are important will work out perfectly, they way god wants. trust in the lord with all your heart and things will never go wrong. i wish that i could sing. that would be so cool. i love to dance also, and i can't wait to try out for pom squad. i love being in front of everyone. i wonder how lizzie learned to work computers. that is a weird kid. i am really bad at computers, you can ask mrs. allen about that one. mrs. allen would love lizzie. she is so computer and gets everything done, and understand computers. what she doesn't understand she can figure out also. jennifer welch is really nice but i hate the fact that she is so pretty. i miss sarah. i wish that i could decorate a room and rationalize as well as her. lately i have not really been so tired. i have been running on about 3 to 5 hours of sleep a night, but it has been okay. i really think that i could look a lot better if i had been running and sleeping more. i think that in a while i am going to go jogging outside, but i better do it before it gets dark inbox users: get your email on your mobile phone

"i could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - clinton's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. i could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. what used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. people are running around with bad attitudes because they are the ""rebellious"" ones. it is truly not they that are rebellious. they are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. true rebellion is seen in writing. in the early years of the united states, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. i think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. i think it was hawthorne who was greatly criticized for his scarlet letter. he wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished? she had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but i think that hawthorn only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. the story was truly about the liberation hester prin found in her life. i don't think that is exactly what i was aiming at, but i am sure someone would understand. i like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when i compare myself to others of greater intelligence i find myself utterly an idiot. while on the subject of intelligence i would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. i do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. i feel as though there is something of importance that i could say, however seeing as i am the utter idiot, i find a rare occasion that i have anything interesting to say. i guess i would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. i would like to soak up a lot of life while i have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. i mean, sometimes i am trying so hard to enjoy life i forget that i am living it. there will never be another today. this is the only august 30, 1998 that i will ever experience. i would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent.

"man this week has been hellish. anyways, now it's time for the 20 minute writing assignment. i'm pretty exhausted at the moment, and have a lot of studying to do tonight. my eyelids are pretty heavy, my hair damp. i just got out of the shower because i was working out. i think i have developed a pretty noticable case of add (attention deficate disorder) from various substances. it's difficult for me to keep writing without my mind wandering. my friend just walked in the room talking about some funny asian kids next door to us. now its going to be even harder to concentrate. he just said the word tit. it's such a funny word, i'm sure you would agree. my mouth tastes like butt, i need to stop smoking cigarettes. crap, i just looked at the time and realized i didn't record what time i started at. i hope this thing is timing it for me. ""simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. "" my thoughts are scrambled. so much to soak in, so much going on. individual words strike up new emotions about various subjects. my friend said the word mom, i thought of my mom. i don't want to go home and probably wouldn't except for the fact that my mom misses me so much. i keep getting distracted by music that i'm playing, it's probably not best to be listening to it while working, but this is an informal assignment (if i remember correctly) so hopefully i'll be fine. i can't wait for tomorrow to be over and the weekend to begin. the band i'm listening to is called the roots, they'll be playing next weekend at acl. i'd really like to see them there, they are a really good and well known hip-hop group. tix are 80 bucks so its doubtful ill be going all 3 days, maybe i'll just get a one day pass. i could also meet a lot of people at the acl fest (hopefully). i feel kind of lonely at the moment, i thought i would have made a lot more knew friends here at the university by now. it seems to me that most people are still hanging out with their friends and clicks from high school, kind of lame in my opinion. i hang out with my roommate and another friend from high school, most of the time the latter. we go out and attempt to seek out other people like us, whom we find unique or ""cool. "" one major complaint i have about the people here is that it seems like everyone is still trying to prove themselves. just like high school, except more facial hair. i might just be depressed and seeing everything in a negative light, but at the moment it all seems logical to me. my friend just came back in the room. he's cool. we're going to go study chemistry as soon as i'm done with this assignment. man i need to stop chatting on the internet, my typing is really horrible. i keep forgetting to capitalize letters, and i keep spelling things incorectly. like i was saying, it's a pitty that everyone here seems so fake. don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that seem really interesting, but at the same mind it sickens me how everyone conforms to certain styles and clicks. god damn, grow up people. everyone's trying so hard to get laid. please don't grade me down. i can't help but writing about this crap, it consumes me. writing this actually hasn't been hard at all. right now i'm feeling a little more relaxed and lighthearted than i was before writing. it might be a good idea to start writing regularly. it could be good for me, and i think it's cool when people do things like that. i love writing, but not necessarily structured writing. i wonder how long it's been. my whole body is tired, man i'm lonely. i need a girlfriend! party's are not a good way to meet girls here, stupid sluts just looking for a good time. it seems like there are less people here like me than i thought there would be. i was expecting a more mature student body. don't get me wrong, i like partying, i love getting drunk, i love having fun. i don't know where i'm going with this. it just seems people here are kind of stuck up on themselves, and not as intelligent and interesting as i thought they would be. oh well, we all can dream.

"i am pretty tired today. i haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. i have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. i work with the youth group at the church i go to. it is getting very busy there as well. we are really trying to get the numbers back up. after the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. right now i am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. i was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. we are working construction on our new church building. it is very exciting. we have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. so for the last week they have been breaking through walls. it has been really cool to watch. my coffee smells really good. i am listening to some audio adrenaline. they are a christian band i just downloaded. they sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. i am switching majors this semester from engineering to a dual major in history and spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh? i think it will be good. i got accepted into the uteach program and so starting this semester i will be in an austin public school teaching and observing. i will be in the classroom starting next week. i am very excited. my arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. i think they are going to fall off. i have a lot to do today. since i am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. i think i will be pretty far behind in this class psy 301 because the co-op does not have the book(it is out of stock) they won't have it until monday the 8th. i'll just have to read a lot next week. i need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. i am trying to sell my truck. it is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. about 10 miles per gallon. i think i will put it on auto trader and see what i can get for it there. my coffee is done and it is calling my name. come. drink me. "" i guess i will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. i am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and i am really tired. i have to read six books for my history class. it's not so bad i have alreay read one of them and have started on another. the first was very boring. i think the rest will get better. this is a good song. i am also taking chem 302 i think it will be a challenge because i don't really remember chem 301 that well. i kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. what other classes do i have?. i am trying to teach myself spanish right now. it is fun. i think i can use spanish a lot later in life. i hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth'college ministry. but who knows what the big guy has in store for me. college age has a lot of possibilities. i am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. i don't know how that is going to turn out but i think it will be fun. this last summer me and a couple of friends went to colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed mt. elbert (which is the highest peak in the rockies @ 14,433) it was a lot of fun. i and looking at a picture of me and my friend chris. it is of when we went skydiving last year. that was a whole lot of fun. ""people may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". reads a poster on my wall. i read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. i would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches i would want them to say that i had a heart like david "". a man after god's own heart.

" i was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because i've never really done anything like this. so i decided to put it off until the last minute. it is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. so far i havent really met any new people that i would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. i think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ut. it is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. although i know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. i don't know i guess will just have to see how things turn out. one thing that i am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. in fact she is a mere stones throw away in lld. she means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. i mentioned lld well that is a girls dorm, near llb which is my dorm whitis court that i now call home. whitis is a nice little community although i don't much enjoy some of the company here. the rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in jester. however its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. it seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. i guess its just one more thing ill have to get used to. not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. i am also planning on joining the marine corps and going to the plc course this summer. it is a big step in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. my father was a marine and his father was in the army and i feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. one thing that i would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. it seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. i know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. he came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. i really do love and care for my family but i believe they think much to the contrary. i guess i don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. this short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much i miss them.

" i'm very worried about many things right now. i feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. i haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. i'm usually a guy that stays on top of things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like i'm not on top of things. i have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. i should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. i'm in houston right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. most of the time i was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. i find that houston is not as fun as it was. things are starting to change. my views and my emotions are quite different than before. i view my parents and my brother differently. i appreciate their company more than i did before. i guess i just miss them an awful lot. my brother and i are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in houston. i enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. i'm also kind of glad that i am going back to austin later today. i missed alot while i was gone. a friend's birthday party, ut's first football game, and a chinese bible study meeting that i was hoping to attend. i can gladly say that i don't regret comming to houston and being back home. i enjoyed it fairly well. suddenly, i feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. i'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that i should be doing, but i have a smile on my face. a sense of peace and a sense of sadness that i'm going to depart from this wonderful place i call home. both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. i can smell it from upstairs. i haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. university of texas is not what i had in mind. it is not as fun and exciting as i thought it would be. all my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. i guess things will get better as time progresses. i'm still not use to the freedom that i have and still not use to other things. i have also found out that i have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. i rather just be around those that i feel more comfortable around. the people at ut are nice thus far, i have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. i enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. i have learned that friendships are very important. since i use to move alot, from places to places, i have learned how to make friends and still be myself. i feel like i have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. i was very close to him and we were like brothers. now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. my friend has never dated before, but now is dating. he spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. i really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. i hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. college will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that i will never experience before. sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future nick chu.

" okay, i am working on assignment number one in which if i understand correctly, i am to follow my thought pattern. i am thinking about everything that i need to accomplish in the next two or three days. this is difficult to follow because everything seems to run together. this happens to me every night when i try to go to sleep. sometimes it takes me hours to get there. i have to actually talk myself into clearing my thoughts in order for me to get some sleep. there have got to be some better relaxation techniques that i should try in order to sleep, because i am always tired. when you are always tired, it is difficult to get everything accomplished because your mind and body just do not cooperate. i wonder how much power the mind actually has over the body. maybe that is something that we will discuss in class. i find the topic very interesting. it is amazing how much more conscientious you become of your thoughts when you are trying to track them. it seems to make you lose some of the negativity or criticism that usually passes through one's mind. it is hard to think when you are trying to, but when you would rather not, you are overloaded with thoughts. just what exactly are thoughts anyway? i wonder just how the brain actually thinks. the human mind and body are absolutely amazing. they work so precisely that it is quite intriguing. life itself is amazingly difficult sometimes. all my life, i have wanted to get big, now i would love to be back in kindergarten. life was so simple back then, now everything is rushed and hurried and there are still not enough hours in the day to get everything done that needs to be done. i wonder how other people seem to do everything with such ease, because i definitely cannot seem to get away with doing anything easily. maybe i will be a stronger person because of it, or maybe i will be insane by age 40. who knows? only time will tell. i wish i could see into the future to know whether what i am doing now will pay off or if it is being done in vain. time, what a concept anyway. i would imagine that the world would be quite chaotic without it, but sometimes i still wish that it would go away. i have been typing for a little more than ten minutes now. look at that, i just used time in a simple statement. the concept of time has probably always existed in some form or fashion, however it could not have always been this exact. i wonder who came up with making it the way it is today and if that person knew what a profound effect it would have on the world. i am already ready for christmas break. i had an absolutely wonderful summer and cannot quite seem to put summer behind me and get in the going to school mode. i want to do well in my classes. i graduated fourth in my class and had a gpa of over one hundred. i made one b is first grade and swore that i would never make another. i guess college is a different thing though and i will have to wait and see how everything works out. it is quite an adjustment from high school. i was trying to stay away from this topic due to our second writing assignment, but my mind is consumed with thoughts about everything that is going on right now which is moving away and going to this absolutely huge school. there are more people on this campus than there are in my whole town. anyway, i have been typing for more than twenty minutes now. i think my mind skips around a lot and jumps from topic to topic, but oh well, that is how i work.

"i'm not so sure how i felt about it yet. not that it was bad or anything, but i'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. it seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. but than again, i guess the experiments that i did this for will probably deal with those issues. i really don't know why i tried to do that survey right when i got up this morning, i just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, i finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 4 times. that was a little frustrating. there is something else that's really bothering me right now also. nothing to do with school, but socially. i live in california, and hate to say it, but i am a pretty stereotypical californian kid. i mention this because i have this burning passion for the ocean. even most people who live in california don't feel as deeply about it as i do. i knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when i came to school, but i didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. well anyway, i really miss the ocean. every night i try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. when i walk to class i even feel it in my feet and legs. just on their own my legs begin to surf. the same muscle motions, i guess they call it muscle memory. i can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. that's all i live for. or lived for. texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while. no i take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, i guess texas just got in the way for a little while. that's where my problem comes up socially. i now realize that if you're not in california, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. i feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. like i said, the perfect stereotype. i guess i wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how i felt. how the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. it's a way of life, not just a social activity. it's a culture, and it's become who i am. not just surfing. i love it but that is only one small facet of why i love the ocean. i just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times i've had there. whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. the ocean can do all of that. but people don't seem to realize that. i love texas, well i don't know if i love texas. but i definitely love ut, it's just that i have to sacrifice so much more that i realized that i would have to do. i came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. that's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. it's not that i feel like i'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. but i just wish people would have the same opportunities as i did, or have. i want them to fall in love as i did. but that's impossible if you stay in texas for a lifetime. come to think of it, i really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, i think i'm going to do that today. i've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that i lost sight of the one back in sd. i'm going to make a promise to myself that i will never lose touch of what i left back home, or the people that i left. just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as i continue to grow, and add to those memories here.

"hello. my name is neha shah, and i'm a freshman this year. so far i love ut and i'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and i actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing i really fear is that i will slack off. i am great at doing my work, and i know that i will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, i have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, i'm not homesick at all. i'm actually doing very well here. i met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that i've come close to two of the people that i met. one of which i am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. i finally gained the confidence in myself and i gained so much to my self esteem. on a normal, day to day basis, i try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever i'm feeling down. my friends and family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone i love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when i have a problem, and i know that. he's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when i left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, i've recieved about 4 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. i'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. i am so proud of being indian, and i'm also very proud to be part of the family that i'm in. i wouldn't change that at all. i grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. i like growing up there, but i really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way i'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone i need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something i really wanted. i wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. i had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. i love it. i like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, i love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when i went to new york city a couple of years ago, all i wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, i like to live life like that. doing things i by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. i've always been independent and i'm fairly sure that's becuase i take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because i'm the older child. i like doing things on my own, so then i know if i make a mistake, i can fix it. i don't like depending on others all the time, but i love being with people. i know those are two contradicting statements but i do have those that i rely on, and i do consider connections when i need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, i love my life. i can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and i want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and i hope to succeed with great pride.

"thoughts are constantly bombarding me since i moved here. it is a whole new world now. time is a precious commodity that i need to manage more efficiently. i see so many different people here and i have met quite a few people these past weeks. my future is on the line now, but i am so young. so many things are tempting me away from my goals. i must get organized as soon as possible. girls are everywhere and there are so many cool ones. i never can remember all those names. my fraternity has a bunch of really good guys in it i can not wait until pledgeship is over. life is at it's best and worst right now. i have never been this emotionally unstable. my mind is like a roller coaster. i guess i have not adjusted to everything yet. once i do maybe i will be alright. i do not really have a grip on all of my classes. once again i need to get organized. now that no one is telling me to do anything i need to work on my self motivation. i find myself thinking a lot about things that went on in high school but i do not miss it much at all. i do miss football. it kept me in shape therefore making me feel good about myself. i think about girls too much of the time. it drives me crazy sometimes. i love austin. it is such a great city. i love the university's atmosphere. it feels good to be free. i need to stop procrastinating, it kills me. school work constantly haunts me until i finally do it. i am not really depressed or anything. overall i am doing well. i hope i get texasou tickets. i would hate to miss this years game. last game was pretty fun.

"" i'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness, because that is definitely what i am feeling right now. it's late monday night and i am taking this time to break up the reading that i have fallen behind in. while i am technically still studying psychology, it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text. what is the point of this assignment anyway? how could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind? i guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject. the human mind. there really is no other single entity (besides the female mind) which is so complex and irregular. humans are an interesting study, which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology, sociology and history. but psychology really is the king of the social sciences, it's all but required for a college student. i couldn't believe how stereotypical i felt when i uttered the phrase ""my psych class"", it's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet. now that i mentioned the greek societies on our campus, i'd like to delve into that a little. after overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of kinsolving today, (they travel in packs) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that sororities and fraternities actually limit social interaction. sure it's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick, but i honestly don't feel compelled to join a fraternity. free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season, but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality. fraternity issues become the mindset of the member, and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person, be they in the same frat or not, is almost always taken advantage of. yes, some fraternities do some good community work, but it limits people into one train of thought, their loyalty is admirable to the members, but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded. of course, coming from a freshman non-frat male, that sounds like every other person with an opinion, ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality. i really don't oppose the fraternity'sorority concept, because it is a need some people truly need filled. but the sight of another party where 70% of the attendance is male, 20% are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people, and the other 10% are passed out, it makes them all seem the same. i feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody, but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the kappa party or the pi phi foam bash, but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked out of those parties. i feel definitely stereotypical again, from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties, could i possibly be the more prototypical male? well, here's the sinker, it's time to discuss sports. i cover them for a newspaper, but honestly i'm just like another fan, but willing to put in the work. too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio, it's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space. any fan with a computer can put together that the cowboys are in a rebuilding year, but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices, meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story. i guess i am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take' about the latest controversy regarding sports. that's not to say that all of them are garbage, but too many of them i find repetitive and dull, and bringing nothing new to the argument. covering a sport is different than giving an opinion, and i enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air. i love the hunt, and that not only makes me strange, but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer. of course, as a college freshman, i really don't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling, but i figure the experience couldn't hurt. much like my decision to take this psychology class, it may seem stereotypical, but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others. my time is up, i am sorry to whoever is reading this, it must seem very much like the others i'm sure, but i look forward to this class and i thank you for this very interesting assignment.

"the first thing that comes to mind as i sit here is an immense feeling of relief. i have just finished the rough draft of my rhetoric paper. it's due tomorrow and i wasn't sure i could pull it together. it's not up to the standard of writing i like, but that's why it's a rough draft. i find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since i got here. i know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. the first night i was here, i was sitting back listening to my music and reading when i thought about home and everything that had gone on there. i remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. it wasn't homesickness. something about the song i was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky i am. i've had a great life. my parents were very supportive in whatever i did and still are. my friends were always there for me and i never endured any life tragedies. the truth is that i really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. it just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what i personally considered an ideal life. i really do think i've led an ideal life. never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. the only thing i consider a life tragedy is the fact that i didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and i fought to hard to get here to not come. i think that i'll love it here. actually, i already do. most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. i don't see how. the people around me are great, my classes interest me, and i'm never bored. i don't not miss home, but i'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. as far as i'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. i'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. this weekend i'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which i am finding myself attracted to. the next weekend is another football game. i'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. marching in front of 80,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. of course, that's only half the fun. the real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. i'm glancing at my clock and see that i've only got about ten minutes left? how am i going to ramble on for another ten minutes. i write fiction stories for fun, love english, and am a journalism major. rambling writing style for me. i wonder why i'm occasionally having trouble continuing. who knows? psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. this is harder than i thought. maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. when i write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. a plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. just writing off the top of my head is something new. well, not new, but usually the ideas i get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and i can plug them into a structure. that's actually how i start a lot of my english papers. start off the top of my head and find a flow. after that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on.

"somehow i just submitted an blank assignment so hopefully this one will submit when it is completed. i should be studying for my first astronomy test right now. somehow i managed to put it off until the last minute like i did with this writing assignment. i need to break this procrastination problem before i get any further into the semester. i have this problem every fall that i have been in college. in spring i am fine i get everything done ahead of time. i am sure it has nothing to do with fall or spring. i am hoping this fall my grades will be awesome but it is hard adjusting to a new environment. i just transferred to ut after 2 years at the university of north texas. i have been living here now for almost three weeks. i feel like i'm on vacation or something. while i miss my old apartment and friends, i am very happy to be here at ut. i couldn't get in to ut directly after high school because of my class rank. i didn't really concern myself with school in high school. suddenly when i started at unt academics became more important to me and my grades improved. i applied to ut expecting to not get accepted because i had heard horror stories of how hard it is to transfer in. it came as a complete surprise when my parents called and told me i got a letter of acceptance. i instantly decided that i was ready for the move. it never really hit me that i was leaving my friends behind in denton until now. i think i offended one of my closest friends in denton because i was so excited about moving and didn't really seem to care that i was leaving. suddenly two weeks before i moved she decided irrationally that she never wanted to speak to me again. oh well. i love austin.

"my goodness. i have so much to do over the next few daysnot to mention the next semester. wow, my first semester in college. i love this freedom. i want to go to sleep. i feel like i'm completely wasting the time and the freedom i have by sleeping through it all. my roommate is at a delta gamma function right now. i'm in the sorority. i really should be there. i guess i'm a party pooper. she pissed me off a few hours ago. i really liked her, but i'm beginning to get some weird vibes from her. someone was caught smoking weed on our floor in our dorm tonight, and the resident assistant went to talk to him about it. my roommate got really mad about it. she said, ""that's so dumb. that's why those people wanted to live off campus. the ra said he was going to be lenient on that kind of thing, and now he's getting them in trouble just because someone ratted them out. "" oh well. oh god. i have to go deal with some feminine hygiene issues. okay, i'm back. anyway. i don't care where you live. that's still completely illegal, and people shouldn't be doing that. she was just so blas' about it. i don't drink, and i don't exactly condone that either, but smoking pot is so much worse. if people are going to do illegal things, then that really sucks. but if they're not hurting anyone besides themselves, then whatever. if that's the case, then let them do their own thing. but they absolutely do not have the right to feel victimized if they get caught. that's so immature and irresponsible. i'm listening to canon by pachelbel right now. wait. i have to check the spelling on ""pachelbel. "" yay. i was right. i figured i would be. not to sound cocky or anything. i just like when things are spelled correctly. oh. i have to press ""repeat. "" i really like this song a lot. i'm getting more and more into this classical music thing. my parents, or my mom really. my dad's not really concerned with me very much. my mom raised me to be pretty cultured. i love music and the arts. so anyway. i love this song. the string quartet played it as the wedding march at my mom and my stepdad's wedding when i was only eight years old. i was the maid of honor. goofy. this song reminds me of one of the instrumental pieces from the little mermaid. the part in the movie where prince eric is escorting the human ariel around his town. the instrumental piece is playing when they are dancing in a little square and he lifts her up just as the music climaxes. oh. it's so beautiful. that part always gives me the chills. that sounds so dorky. i think it's just the combination of the beautiful music and the thought that eric and ariel are falling in love. hold on. got to press ""repeat"" again. sometimes this laptop really makes me mad and frustrated. the keys are so small and close together that i press the wrong one a lot. it's really annoying. i miss california. i used to live there. i feel sick. i'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. he was smoking earlier, and i was in the same room. on top of that, i've had a cold for the past four days. i'm all stuffed up, and i have to blow my nose again. i switched to another classical cd. i especially like some of the pieces on this cd. right now, tchaikovsky's (yes, i did look at the cd to see how to spell that) ""piano concerto in b flat minor"" is playing. i really wish i knew what ""in b flat minor"" means. ok. my ""stream of consciousness"" was interrupted. i feel really bad. my hallmate called me and i've been down in her room for the past 45 minutes. oh. i just walked back into the room and ""the waltz of the flowers"" from the nutcracker is playing on my ""100 masterpieces of classical music"" cd. this is such an amazing song. i miss taking ballet classes. i really need to get back into it. i'm so out of shape. i have this yucky flab on my thighs. and i really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. i'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that i've been doing for the past three years. it's all for show. i want to go back to taking classes where i can dance for the sake of dancing, where i can appreciate the beauty of it, where i can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. i guess i'm weird. i just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when i'm listening to music or when i'm dancing. i just have these moments where i get goosebumps and i'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. i really miss california a lot. and i'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. my throat hurts. i just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell ""throat. "" that kind of thing really scares me. i mean. we're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. i really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. it just really pisses me off. that's so analretentive of me, but it just really makes me mad. okay. i have to do my homework for my linguistics class now. i must say that i had a really interesting time typing this assignment. i've never done anything like this before. i think it has convinced me that i need to start keeping a journal of my thoughts.

"i am going home for the weekend, and i'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. i miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. i mean, i'm not sad or anything, but i really cannot wait to get there. i'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at ut. memories of high school, things i did, things i said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, i often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. i think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where i want to be right now, most of the days, that's where i'd like to be. i think about the solos i took on various songs, the ideas i came up with, and the ones i'm coming up with now; i wish i could be in it to play them, i whistle and hum the different rhythms that i would play, my friend and i try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. i also am thinking about my family and friends, how i miss them, and how i'm going to them this weekend. i think of how i want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. i'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not i will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, i think about my sister in houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how i'm going to corpus this weekend. but i know that we'll see each other soon. i think about my room at home. the food i'm used to eating in corpus, how i really want to eat there because i'm tired of this dorm food. i try to remember as much about home as i can, but there always seems to be more that i think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when i was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. i just can't wait to be there, and i can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. i also think about my classes here, how i'm wondering how i'm going to do in them, if i'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. i hope that i will do good on my first tests, and i hope that the semester is not too hard as long as i study and keep up with everything. i think of my classes at high school, whether i was that smart or not, i wonder if i'm smart enough to be an engineer, i hope that i do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like i'm stupid or something. i think all of these thoughts right now, and like i said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like i'm thinking about everything at the same time, and i guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while i think about everything i can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph.

"i've never felt empty ever before, its amazing how complete your life feels for a certain time and then just because of this one person everything just falls apart and you have to start all over again i know it happens to everybody at some point of their lives but whoever it must be happening to they must be going through hell. i believe in god and i know that whatever he's doing its for my betterment but i wonder why he did this in the first place if he wasn't going to make it work. right now there are so many questions in my mind but there is no one to answer them at all i'm feeling so disgusted with everything i feel angry and its all because on this one person who before a year didn't even mean anything to me and now rules over all my thoughts and feelings. i wish i could foresee the future or go back into time and fix up everything before it falls apart. i'm sitting in a lab full of people and my friends come every now and then and say hi to me and treat me sweetly and every other second my thoughts keep going back to this evil person who just messed up everything i do. i must be sounding like any girl who's fallen out of a relationship but i don't care i'm very hurt, and in my case i know he doesn't care at all whether i'm sad or depressed because he has someone else waiting for him at home who's going to make it alright for him and make him forget me forever and ever. and me? i m going to cry and keep thinking of him for a long time because i know i'm true and i loved him even if he didn't. so if i cry i know its because of the love i feel for him, and he doesn't care because he never really loved me at all, and i was stupid all the way to believe that he did. i promise never to be that stupid again i'm going to immerse myself in my work and other people and get on with my life whether my heart likes it or not because all this while i've been doing whatever my heart wanted me to do and didn't do whatever my brain wanted me to but now i'm going to think practically because i know that in this cruel world people who care for others get run over and only the cold hearted survive. so i am going to be cold hearted. and i'm going to be mean. sweet from the outside and mean from the inside just how he is. the whole world loves him because he's sweet from the outside but no one knows about how dark he is from the inside as bitter as an evil man who's never any good for anyone in his life. where are people when you really need them, my parents so so far away who don't even have a clue about what's happening in my life. i'm so angry i could fight with the person and cry in front of him and take him in front of god and ask him to do justice for me if anybody in third world can't do it but i know i can't ask for anything like that ill just have to study move on and do great things with my life and make my parents really happy because they love me more than any guy in this world can ever do. as i write i'm waiting for these 20 minutes to get over so i can get out of this frame of mind and hide my thoughts in something else or just go stand outside in the warm sun and away from this computer where i feel i'm going to get an email from him at any minute. i hate being a slave to my thoughts and feelings i hate being an emotional slave to a guy who doesn't give a damn about me. i want everything to be right again. as it was before i want him to hug me when i'm tired and tell me that he cares for me oooh why does life have to be so difficult and challenging why can't it be stable is love too expensive to ask for or has it just become very rare in this world where people just care for themselves and nobody else. i can't write very quickly because i'm not that good at typing otherwise i can go on and on about this but then again i don't want to because i don t want to feel sorry for myself at all i'm beautiful, intelligent and there is someone out there who deserves me more then this selfish freak.

i think the emmys are kinda boring tonight and i don't really feel like doing this assignment but i have to because i know i won't feel like doing it tomorrow because i have a busy day - i need to go wash my towels because i don't have any clean ones for tomorrow i wish the stupid laundry room was closer because i hate walking all the way down that other hall but oh well - my stomach keeps hurting because i drank too much last night i wish i hadn't done that because i have felt nauseous all day and its not fun - i don't like martin short i think he's annoying and his speech he is giving right now is not evn funny maybe i should study after i'm done with this instead of being lazy and sitting here watching tv all night - i hope that i am not behind in any of my reading because that would suck if i don't do well on my tests - i wonder where my roomate is and when she is coming back i haven't seen her all weekend but i'm sure she is just at her boyfriend's i just need to remember to tell her chris called twice today i wonder who chris is because i have never met him but he calls her a lot - our room looks messy right now i need to clean it but i don't feel like it the bathroom is starting to get pretty gross too but no one ever does anything about it because it sucks to clean up after other people especially in the bathroom maybe my mom will clean it for us when she comes to visit because she doesn't mind doing that kind of stuff for me - if she doesn't come this friday than i think i'm going to go home for the weekend because i want to sleep in my bed and have some good food and talk to my mom and my sister i need to ask karoline if she wants to go home this weekend too but she'll probably have architercture stuff to do i can't believe how much time she spends at the studio sometimes she's there till like three int the morning but i think she likes the other people there and one guy lives by her so she walks home with him inthe middle of the night - its kinda scary to walk around austin at night because there are a lot of weird people and you never know what could happen i was sort of scared last night when we left that arcade and were walking to the car i hope that i didn't scratch scotts door when it hit the curb because it made that awful noise ,1,-1.800034 0.942196 0.925047 1.201435 1.280542 0.035791 -0.411851 0.158718 -0.526738 -0.722979 7.141776 -0.590446 0.380488 0.817794 -0.763482 0.0 -0.04277 0.691371 -0.142717 0.209836 -0.094071 -0.416793 1.600351 0.300091 -0.624052 -0.947203 -1.236919 -0.324191 0.116338 -0.431348 -0.606452 0.015906 0.658185 -0.321912 0.967737 -0.581789 1.815862 3.019441 -0.418554 1.721786 -1.038726 0.387819 0.340862 1.06138 0.375587 0.691547 0.621629 0.831928 0.29556 1.062955 0.067144 1.51089 -0.243334 0.612046 -0.806665 -0.441747 -1.366515 -0.061566 -0.359288 0.018447 0.811875 -1.600134 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.596615 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.387564 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 2.072635 -0.422267 0.700518 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.76568 4.465093 4.041647 4.921881 4.813748 4.710244,870

"i love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since i last wrote my entry. i have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. i had english today at 9 am and really enjoy it, i like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which i like also--more of a high school feel. it is my birthday tom. and i am not excited about it because i have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. all my friends are already talking about where to live next year and i am not sure why. they all say that things fill up so quickly. i got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, i guess i had assumed we would live together next year. college is so much money. i feel like at every corner i turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. i am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, i am doing some babysitting though. kids are my life, i do not know what i would do without them. i was thinking the other day, my dogs back in houston--do they know i am gone? it made me sad to think they have no clue if i am ok, i am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. my phone is ringing but i think i will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, i have gained a lot of weight and i can feel it, i am slower and get more tired quickly. i wonder how it will feel to 19! almost 20, i feel like just yesterday i was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times i miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but i miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. right now my friend connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. she is thumbelina, so cute. there is a vacuum going on in the background, i really need to shave my legs. and lay out. my brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, i miss him also but sometimes i wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. i want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. he already has two. i am a theta and i really like them. tonight i am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as i do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. my e mail is broken and i am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. they are so slow. now my friend has left the room, i feel like i can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and i am not hungry. i am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at acc and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, i think the tv show jerry springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. i love beanie babies, they are so cute, but i do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!! i love the summer and am sad it is almost over! my 20 minutes is up so bye bye.

on that last sentence instead of while. anyways, i had to put it down now because i'm now conscious of the fact that i started listening to the smiths so i could say i was listening to them whilst typing this. there i did it, i put whilst. i also kinda put the smiths on here probably so that if someone reads this then they'll know i listen to the smiths. i do that a lot. i specific music whenever people around, i don't know, i guess so they'll think it's cool or something. i've been feeling really lonely recently. i was thinking about that because i wonder if anyone is going to read this, and if they do, if all this stuff being collected is going to be used so we can learn something about ourselves. i don't really want to hide anything, because i'd rather someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me, than type jive like, oh i don't know what to write, blah blah, school was fun today, because i feel really fucked up recently. i don't want things to change, this shit is so gay. sorry, i know we're supposed to type thoughts but that's still pretty bad. i was happy this summer with a girlfriend and my friends around, but then we had to break up because she went away for college, and i freaked out on her which wasn't cool, but i was just really scared. yes, this song is awesome. i should probably go to the mental health center, but i'm scared of the process of signing up for an appointment, probably more than actually telling someone something, because then i have to talk to real people and i'm not so good at that. that's why i'm really lonely lately, i don't know how to talk to people, and i'm meeting all these new people, and i have no idea what to say, so i just don't say anything. i'd kind of really like to meet some new people, because i hate sitting around my room all the time, even though that's all i do. i'm scared to like walk up and talk to someone though. it's quite a frightening experience, and i get all nervous when i'm around people. this typing is really hurting my shoulder because i'm on my laptop. shit, i just hit the back button. alright, i'm going to keep typing, but this is really gay, now i got to tack on another 10 minutes. whoever reads this is probably going to be pissed that they have to read a 1'3 more than everyone else. well, i better not get in trouble for it is all i can say. speaking of gay, i called my girlfriend, i guess ex-girlfriend, because i want to keep in touch with her, and she told me about how she saw this guy with a dashboard confessional sticker and a smiths sticker on his backpack, and she told me about how she and her new friend went up to him and asked him if he actually listened to good music or not, it being assumed that dashboard confession is pretty crappy, (and who's to blame that assumption, with lyrics like, far away from all the stupid questions ' 'hey, did you get some' ' man that is so dumb"") nonetheless, what the hell is she talking about, she didn't even know who the smiths were until like a month ago when i told her about them, and i mean, i still think it's funny, but a lot of the music she is into now is from me. i don't know, i think i am just pissed off because she wanted to break up. but, it's perfectly reasonable, we're completely across the country, i'm being ridiculous i know, it just ended so fast, and i'm still upset. ahh, this isn't fair, i still have 13 minutes left because i hit back somehow, this is going to take forever. my shoulder is kind of starting to hurt, i think this is a really cool assignment, because it's just stream of consciousness, but it's taking forever, agamemnon. that's what i say when i'm saying aggh, or something, because it sounds cooler. i can't stop thinking about my girlfriend. i really think i have some sort of problem with dependence, i feel like i have to be around people most of the time or i start to feel sort of depressed, like no one cares about me. this being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment, is making things worse. my history of the banjo teacher, that's a freshman seminar, told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo, and it's driving me crazy, because i hate semi-long nails, they always feel dirty, and i can feel them now whilst i type, clacking against the keys, it's irritating. i think there's something wrong with my smell, i don't think i can smell anything. that wouldn't be surprising anyways, i think there's something wrong with everything about me and everything i do. i always seem to fail at anything i try, i can get good grades, but i've been missing assignments in college already, which is just compounding things and making things worse. aggh, or i mean agamemnon. i keep looking at this scratch on my arm, where i cut myself with a razor. i don't think i'll do that again, i was feeling really depressed on saturday, i didn't eat anything all weekend, and i normally regimen my meals very carefully, but i didn't eat anything, and feeling depressed and having read about self-injury, i wanted to try it, but cutting myself with a razor didn't feel particularly painful or punishing, and hardly seemed worth the effort involved, considering you have to clean up the blood, so i don't think i'll bother with that again. i can't even do that right. i've actually been feeling better the rest of this week, but i kinda want to talk to someone, just because i don't think there's any guarantee i won't feel like i did on saturday again, and i felt terrible saturday morning. that was until i did dxm, which of course made me realize that things will eventually work themselves out. i just wish i could manage to carry that feeling over into the real world, because not worrying about things is such a beautiful feeling. i think i worry too much, but i'm always sure that as soon as i get by myself no one's going to ever want to see me again and i'll be stuck like that. i wish i could meet some people here, but i don't know what to say. it's hard to just talk to someone, it's always boring conversation, and at the end, they always go their own way, and never want to do something with you again. no matter how good you try to make the conversation, they never seem to want to continue after that, despite reading constantly that the way to make friends is to simply talk to someone. bullshit.

"i don't understand how it is i'm supposed to write this thing when i can't even type as fast as i can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think. at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller. i have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right? it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. i hate when people call me smart because i don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really don't. i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them. they were so bluh. i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never i'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. i think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month i had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. i didn't even realize i had talked that much on the thing. now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can i cuss on this thing. i don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree i'm not and early i did say i wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. i wonder if i can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i can't speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it. and i normally understand it too. but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor. i want to be a teacher too but i'm afraid because i'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal i dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. i think i'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem. but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer. i am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. i don't even clean as often as i used to. i just want to be lazy and go out. i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict. i never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which i did. but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. i'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but i'm not about to complain anymore because i'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes. i want to keep writing but i'm supposed to do my pre-cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i don't have.

" okay, so i am in my dorm room alone. i'm mostly thinking about how great my day was. i haven't had a day this good in a long time. even though i had to wake up early i was rewarded by my cotton bowl tickets which makes me happy, because i never win anything so it's really cool for me that i was the one who drew the best number. maybe my luck is finally coming in. i hope so. in addition to the tickets i got to see the guy who i am totally in love with twice today which was simply a gift from god because i hadn't seen him in a long time. when i started to pray for him i got to see him on tuesday, then when i started thinking about him even more, i got to see him twice, and he even spoke to me. i just wonder what he thinks about me. i doubt that he is thinking of me right now, but when he sees me, i wonder what goes through his head. i've never had a guy be truely interested in me before, so i hope that now that i'm in college, my luck will change. judging from my lucky number with the ou tickets, it looks like my luck is changing, but i can't say that it was just luck, because my rededicating my life to the lord contributed to my current happness in a big way. actually he is the entire reason why i am feeling the happiest i have since i have moved here. i have made good friends and i get to see joe. i just hope that i get to experience this feeling for a long time. i really am so happy, when i was walking down the street people were looking at me like i was crazy because i had this huge smile on my face. being a good person and having faith can get you anywhere that you want to be in life, and now that i have accepted that i feel a little more at ease. just a little though, i still worry about my classes. i just really want to do well. i need to catch up on my readings, which i will do this weekend. i just have to make myself. i also need to get my spiral back from meredith. it really pisses me off that she borrowed my notes, and hasn't given them back yet. that is really rude and inconciderant! it's okay though, becuse now i am thinking about joe again, so i am happy. i can't believe how happy it makes me just to think about him. i know i seem crazy because i barely even know him, but there is something about the fact that he makes eye contact with me, and that he is the only guy to ever speak to me on this campus. it just says something about him and about the way that he sees me, at least that's what i think. i just really want to fall in love. i look around and see all of these couples, and watch romantic movies, and listen to love songs, i want it so bad, that i can feel it! something in my gut tells me that joe is going to be my first real love, and even if it doesn't work out in the end and i get my heart broken, i feel like i'm ready. ready to experience something.

" i can't seem to picture anything but just seem to think of silence and the color white. it also seems to help me think of me sort of like a simple person and how my mind is thinking of my personallity and the color white as if i am a boring person. then i think that it is not the color that best represents me because i really believe i am outgoing and that the color white is dull and really not me. i seem to be distracted by the air condition in my apartment as if everything i am thinking is interupted my the noise of the air. blue pops into my head sort of associating the air with the color blue but now it seems as if that is impossible because you can't see air then why would i associate it with the color blue, maybe because it is the color that artists have used in the past to associate wind with. now i have a song by puff daddy in my head and all i know is that i repeat inside my head the same verse as long as we're here we might as well shine together i wonder if they are actually his words because before he has been accused of copying words from other artists. yet it is surprising that i am writing so much and not complaining, maybe because everything is just poping into my head this is different i usually don't think of anything. now i am thinking i don't pay enough attention to myself enough as if i ignore what my minds says. if once i could actually stop and think what my mind says like i am doing right now maybe i would be a better person and i wouldn't be in the position i am put in all the time and maybe just maybe i would'nt be in trouble all the time. now that i say trouble i think of my girlfriend and start to wonder what she is doing and maybe what she is thinkning. isn't it weird how we rather see what otherpeople are thinking rather than seeing what you yourself is thinking. i just thought that was weird but true. now i wonder what all this means all these mixed thoughts without no real sense in them. how can a test be made to tell me what or how i think that's weird. but then again that is the 21 century for you staring right at your face. were there tests that could tell you how you thought 100 years from now or is this just something recent. that last sentence seems stupid like if i were asking the air and waiting for a response. it is raining outside and it is the first time i see rain in austin because i am not from around here it is amazing how the sound of the rain makes me want to sleep but now after so long i found out that rain or the weather does not affect a persons mood. thats weird if there were anything that i was certain in psychology was that it did affect your mood or the way a person felt. just now i wonderd why do they say that if there is an eclipse it is bad for a preganant women. just out of now where i thought that. is it bad? wait a minute who am i asking thats weird how i still want to know something and rather than asking someone who might know something about the subject i rather ask myself to see i really can not come up with an answer. i wonder where my parents are if they are at work or if they are at home and if it is raining there too like it is here or my brothers where are they who knows we hardly see eachother anyways so it is as if i were home ",0,-0.004727 -1.479304 0.60348 -1.692386 -1.284955 -1.000135 0.036077 -0.930901 0.055036 -0.003515 0.055815 0.007313 -0.985574 1.16447 0.124246 0.0 -0.04277 0.142336 -0.446867 0.165386 -0.426943 1.124712 -0.466941 0.205456 -0.624052 0.711982 0.044968 -0.515408 -0.880236 -1.801126 -1.100231 -0.739476 0.060161 -0.906028 -0.733274 -0.731166 3.222158 2.627099 2.743638 0.6417 1.251072 2.281521 -0.586714 0.902455 0.511442 1.660478 -0.478755 0.263957 0.56279 0.142563 0.173573 -0.461878 -0.360824 0.688031 -0.205465 -0.400594 -1.852399 -0.954251 0.357267 1.723695 -1.939937 -0.385607 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.238878 -1.219329 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.330042 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.8683 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.88282 4.217063 3.943761 4.173577 4.572875 4.675756,1811
" it surely was a good day today. i found all my classes without any difficulty. i have been at this school for four days now. and today is the first day that i didn't lose my way to the classrooms. anyway, i don't particularly like this school, but this is the best business school which is near my home, and my mom doesn't want me to leave the state. i was hoping that i could have a math major at mit, but again family argued that it would be so hard to find a job and to have good pay if i had math as my major. as a chinese, i would have to follow their tradition that to obey parents. i know that it probably will sound strange to you, or many other americans. but it just the way it is. god help me! gratefully, i am always a positive person who usually challenges the changing world with unchangeable doings. i might be somewhat too confident sometimes. i enjoy my confidence though. i always enjoy to look at the world from the bright side. i know that there certainly are something ugly, but i think that people don't have to be so critical. if everyone takes good care of himself or herself, be more open-minded, more self-controlled, and more concerned for the good of the society as a whole, then our world will be much brighter, much more beautiful, and much more peaceful. i believe that before we watch out for the others, we should first watch out for ourselves; before we try to change others, change ourselves first. before i complain the shortcomings of others, i try to check with myself that if i have the shortcoming too. this practice requires a peaceful and logical mind. so keep cool! (not only the outside, but also the inside. ) thinking through the past and the future, specially after i finished my pretest on this class, i become more and more grateful that my parents taught me to be what i am now. the skill to cheer myself up no mater how bad the situation become is really helpful. i believe that as human beings our biggest challenge in life is to overcome ourselves. no one can ever make you cry without your permission. choices are always ours! i guess i have been writing for over 20 minutes by now. hopefully this assignment is well done. hope your have a good day. sincerely, linda (da) li ",1,1.017443 -1.536199 0.551638 -1.238785 -1.116206 -1.461814 2.001018 1.712689 1.979332 -0.950178 -0.161984 -0.590446 1.557309 0.909383 1.626431 0.0 -0.04277 -0.532884 -0.534834 2.650406 0.149442 0.745531 -0.988357 0.19756 -0.624052 1.486084 0.225507 0.157822 3.240363 4.09433 2.284682 4.630078 0.275126 -0.906028 0.343256 0.096115 0.082216 -1.170909 -0.598749 0.705534 0.786042 -0.373269 1.076385 -1.438009 0.117253 -1.117217 -1.093488 0.049002 -1.127747 0.313653 -0.135235 0.666089 -0.635685 0.073245 1.363103 0.188445 -0.825954 -0.954251 -0.535551 1.077621 -1.241272 3.239222 0.241534 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.223886 1.066176 -0.073676 1.100203 -0.607823 0.529723 0.351202 -0.422267 -1.103526 2.472915 0.455196 0.137757 4.651008 3.247408 4.245762 4.857375 4.976673,65
"wow, this is incredibly hard to follow my thoughts when i am focused on this. it is too hot outside, i really don't want to walk all the way over to burdine today. my head hurts. college is so stressful, and i feel like i have a heavy weight on my chest. my roommate is annoying. she does not go to sleep until after 3 in the morning, and i can't sleep with the lights on. i am absolutely exhausted. i don't like nypd blue. why aren't there any good shows on when i am actually in my room and able to watch tv? my head is starting to hurt more. i am straining my eyes too much. my chair is in a really awkward position with my keyboard. i don't know how i am going to write for 20 minutes. it has only been 5 minutes and it seems like an eternity. cherry coke is yummy. stupid computer! it keeps freezing up on me. i hate technology. our room looks so unbalanced. my side is really decorated and my vi equipment takes up a lot of room, but my roommate's side is very bare. she isn't a very decorative person anyway. one of my friends is coming to visit on saturday while her husband is at the ut vs. arkansas game. i am nervous about seeing her. she is worried about me and wants to spend time talking. i don't know what i am going to tell her, because i don't want her to be disappointed in me. i am such a horrible person. i don't know why i am the way i am. it really hurts. she wants me to go and see a secular psychologist if i get desperate enough, but i don't like psychologists. especially if i don't know them. there is nothing wrong with me though. it is all a matter of learning to bury bad things inside of you. i miss my friend amanda. i talked to her last night. skittles are cute and yummy. they are so colorful. they cheer me up. my heel hurts from resting my feet on my hard drive. i am thirsty. i think i will take a sip of my cherry coke now. wow, it has only been 11 minutes. my tummy hurts. when i get nervous my tummy gets upset. i really need to wash out my cereal bowl from last night. but i am too tired right now. maybe later. the weather can't decide what it wants to do. it goes back and forth from being sunny and cloudy. i like it cloudy because the sun hurts my eyes and it is so very hot. plus i am allergic to the sun, and i break out every time i am in it for any length of time. so not a good thing. i cut my finger on my soup can the other night. i have so much homework to do and i don't know how i am going to get it all done. the psychology book is so boring. i can't get into it to read for any length of time. i miss my drill team. i won't get to see them until christmas break. it was such a huge part of my life for the last 4 years that i am lost without it now. my friend heather has a bad cold. i took her a care package two days ago. i wonder how she is feeling. ouch! i rolled my foot wrong. that hurt. when are my twenty minutes going to be up? i am getting tired of writing. this is a very odd assignment. i hope i am doing it right. oh well if i am not. my head itches. hmmm. that's interesting. my lips are really chapped. they kinda hurt. i wonder where i put my carmez. just another minute and a half. hmmm. i hope it does not rain today since my class is all the way across campus. that would not be enjoyable. especially since i carry my laptop with me. well my time is almost up. ten seconds. yay i am almost through.

"i am sitting in front of my computer right now thinking about how i have so many things to do and i am not sure how to organize my time sufficiently. i cannot decide what my priorities are yet. of course classes are the most important part of being at college, but there are various clubs and organizations that i am interested in from the description on flyers and posters. i don't know what these clubs are really like though. it is the people that makes an organization fun and you cannot tell what people are like from a flyer. i am really hungry right now. i hate that the dining hall is closed for dinner on sundays, not that the food is really that good anyway. wait this isn't sunday, this is monday. we just didn't have class because it is labor day. that will mix me up all week. i will be a day behind. it is hard to let your thoughts flow naturally when you are thinking about thinking. i am so glad that lindsey came up to visit me this weekend. it feels so good to laugh with someone that already knows you. you don't have to try or think, everything just flows so naturally. i know that it takes time to develop a friendship like this and i cannot expect to just make instant connnections like that in a new place, but i am not good with all that patience and effort. i can't wait until the pizza gets here. i don't feel bad about eating unhealthy food because i have to walk so much around campus. i don't think i've ever walked so much in my entire life. and the heat totally drains me by the end of the day. i am dead tired. i am really surprised by the comfort of the beds in my dorm room. at orientation i couldn't sleep at all because i was so uncomfortable but now the beds don't seem as bad. except the window next to my bed shines light all night long. i am used to total darkness and total silence from home. the car noises and people at all hours makes it tough to fall asleep. i've also been having strange dreams lately. the first couple of weeks in a new place i always have really vivid dreams and i always remember them really clearly unlike usually. this happens everytime i am away from home. wether it was when we moved to singapore or just going to summer camp. i am looking at the picture of my dog sitting on my computer. i miss petting lucy. the other day there was a towel laying on the floor of our dorm room and i had to do a double take because i thought it was lucy laying there. she is too adorable. when i get my own place i am going to get a labrador puppy. i don't think i could ever live totally by myself, without a pet or anything. i either need a roommate or an animal, something to acknowledge my existence with a tangible response. now its been a little over twenty minutes and the pizza is here and it smells really good.

" when i think about what i'm thinking, a void pops up. i guess because the brain never really stops, it's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment. i can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however, so that's what i'll dicuss. a topic that's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend (surprising right?) i think about how happy i am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is. he goes to college at trinity university, which is in my hometown of san antonio. we see eachother nearly every weekend, so it's not hard to sustain the relationship. though, i constantly wonder if he really does care about me. he tells me that he does, and i know that he does, but i'm really insecure about that issue. my insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me, but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal. that's probably why i worry so much about it. however, i am really happy in my relationship. i have no complaints except for my own lack of security. on another topic, i have my first test this thursday. i'm a little scared, but i think that i'll be fine. i pretty much know the material, but i still need to go over and over it to get it down. i don't think i'll have a problem with it. at least i hope that i do well. i feel exahsted thinking about all the studying i have to do for my upcoming tests. i have a chemistry test next week. i don't know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is. but i guess that i'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so i do well. it's so imperitive that i do well in college because i have plans to go to medical school after i graduate. i don't know what else i would do with my life if i didn't get into medical school. i have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen. i could be a teacher if medical school doesn't work out. the pay isn't that great but the job seems pretty alright. i would enjoy some sort of fbi'cia type of work also. i need something that's going to make me constantly think. though i hate studying, as every student does, keeping my mind on the go is something i love. i think that's why i played soccer all my life. soccer is a game of constant thinking. there is no stopping in soccer. there are no time outs, so you can't stop to regroup. you have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player. i wish i was still playing soccer. i really miss it. i stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back. i feel sort of empty without it. it was such a big part of my life for so long. i think i'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the ut soccer team. it's really hard to do that though. the team is extremely competative. though, i think after i talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help. my main concern at the moment is doing well in school. i really need to buckle down and study. i study everyday, but i need to do it more i think. maybe i'm just stressing about my upcoming tests. i'm scared about my chemistry test. though, i think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that i'll be fine. i need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow. the test is thursday, so i have 2 days to get in all the information. i feel tired right now. i wish i had came back to austin earlier so i would've started on my work earlier. well, tomorrow's another day, so i guess i'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow. there's no sense in doing it right this second when i'm not feeling to good and when i'm tired. my main priority is studying for my biology test thursday. i need to go over the old exam she gave to us. my boyfriend just called me, but i had to tell him that i would call him back so i could finish this writing assignment. i really hope i do well on my test thursday. if i did well, i would be so happy. that would mean that i actually liked my major and that i could retain the information pertaining to it. i want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate ""can't consontrait"" with my talking, so i guess i'll go outside. though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while i was reading. oh well, maybe i'm a little more respectful.

"it's crazy to think here i am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. i am now a college student. during high school i couldn't wait for it and now that i'm here i feel out of place. sure, i know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names i no longer remember, and i stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what i expected. the classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially ut. i have not had the success i had i hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that i am, i expected it to come easier. i tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. it makes me wonder if i should have rushed, though i do not see myself as a sorority girl. it seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. are they really paying for friendships? i do not think i would have fit in to such a place. i just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that i will meet some people with whom i really enjoy hanging with. i am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next monday. with 30 people in the class, i know i will get to know some of the other students. i never thought i would admit to being homesick, but it is true. though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. however, when we are there we tend to hate it. isn't it funny how that works? i have also decided that austin is a city full of beautiful people. everywhere i look, goodlooking boys and girls. it definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. i enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. should i really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? well, i do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. i believe i am finding competition in everything. whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people i know. the people i went to high school with. the people whom i now want to separate myself from. another thing i have noticed is how sleepy i always am. here i am at 12:22 writing this when i am insanely tired. but why go to sleep, when i do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. there are also a lot of sick people around. the allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere i have been. i have had a cough and a cold since i've been here. it seems like i have so many problems, but i know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. that is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. i know i need to give things time and make the best of what i have.

"ok, i am really happy right now because after 2 weeks of bs, i've finally got my computer and ethernet working so that i could do my psychology homework. cool, huh. well, my best friend from el paso just called me and told me she's gonna get a tattoo, which i think is pretty dumb because she's gonna be stuck with it for the rest of her life. see, i would get a tattoo, like my zodiac sign or something, but i just always see myself all grown up and old and wrinkly with a tattoo and i think i would feel pretty dumb for getting it then. like, right now i just have my ears pierced once in each ear and i'd like to get 2 more in my left ear and 1 more in my right ear but its still kinda like i'm gonna be to old for that kinda stuff in a few years, you know? what else can i bore you with? oh, my mom sent me a package and i got it today, it was my dry cleaning and some pictures of my dog, morton taylor moore, he's a basset hound. taylor is a family name, its my granddad's and my older brother's middle name. hmmmmmm. . i'm like so happy that tomorrow is friday, not like i'm stressed out or anything, its just a huge adjustment to go from partying all the time in the summer to only partying friday and saturday night, i made a promise to myself that i wouldn't go out on school nights. i really don't have much self control or discipline, but i'm working on it. i was so happy last night, i was in my next door neighbors room and everybody was checking their email and i was just like no, no one has emailed me, but i tried anyway and low and behold, one of my best friends from el paso had emailed me, i was so surprised. see, he was suppose to move to tullorosa, nm but it fell through when he got there so he came back, but he's moving to belize in a day or two but he told me he was going to be back in el paso for thanksgiving except he didn't have a place to stay, and i really hope my mom doesn't mind, but i offered to let him stay in our extra bedroom. oh, then i did one of the stupidest things i've done in a while, i told him that i've had the biggest crush on him since the day i met him, god i'm dumb!!! oh well, its over and done with now, can't change the past, huh. it'd be cool if you could change the past though cause god knows i've done a whole lot of dumb things in my life. ok, sorry, my twenty minutes were up 2 minutes ago so have a nice day. bye ",0,-1.444352 0.132048 -0.41326 0.459776 0.499332 0.610406 -1.444136 -0.495131 -1.049612 -0.605593 0.040003 0.919681 0.339067 -0.787197 -0.981372 0.0 -0.04277 0.805721 0.412253 -0.480696 0.305512 0.175218 0.629017 -0.834928 0.794325 -0.076948 -1.019496 0.58654 0.047001 0.392947 0.291418 0.381373 -0.342073 -0.357278 0.474415 -0.61373 -0.572512 -0.644108 -0.939189 -0.205575 -0.288504 0.194461 -1.096282 0.393487 -0.157665 1.255916 -0.287852 0.327169 0.451212 0.348481 -1.34699 1.50224 2.084641 -2.109181 -0.300988 -0.394717 0.010573 -0.115615 0.570209 -0.027357 -0.503716 0.787407 0.70669 -0.205195 1.601598 1.43493 -0.086094 -1.36115 2.156985 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.120267 0.369441 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.030562 -0.451544 2.432873 0.339418 5.072145 3.532366 4.483071 4.663716 4.674546,339
"last night around 11pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. she told me that a guy i went to high school with had just committed suicide on friday. apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which i had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. no one knew where he was so they went looking for him. they found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). it still hasn't hit me yet. i have been at school with him since the first grade. i know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. after last year i thought everything was going to be better. at the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) kyle committed suicide by hanging himself. after getting over that, will was killed in a car accident. after coping with will's death, i thought nothing else was going to happen. i mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. the rest of my year was going great until april. that was when i found out that one of the girls who i had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. she overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. i couldn't believe it. for years i would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. going to her funeral was the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i cried the minute i got there and didn't stop crying until days later. seeing her parents made it even harder. i mean what can you say to them. nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. nothing could make you feel any better either. she had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. i absolutely and completely fell apart. i couldn't see where i was going i was crying so hard. even now as i am writing this assignment i'm getting tearyeyed. i still don't understand (and i probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. i mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. marshall is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary'junior high school. everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. now i'm just wondering if the saying will come true. will there be a third suicide or death that i'll have to deal with? i really and truly hope so. i sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. when i first started this assignment i didn't think that i'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. this is kind of therapeutic though. i'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so i've decided to start typing about something better. i really excited to be here at the university. i really love it here. my classes and professors are great. i am worried'anxious about final exams though, but i still have awhile before those come around. i'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. unlike in elementary through high school in which every 3 weeks you got a progress report and then every 6 weeks came your report card. i'm also getting used to being alone a lot. sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. but then again you meet so many new people. well, my time's up.

" i am so glad that i am finished with that stupid test for psy. now when i finish this i can take a nap. i need to do laundry and get ready for tonight. i need to get the money that clint and dilen owe me to do the laundry. i am not sure what i am going to wear tonight. i am tired. i hope that we get tickets to the ou football game, i really don't want to go stand in line and wait though. i hope that stephanie and adam will not be mad because i didn't get the tickets. i like adam a lot. he is a really cool guy and i am really glad that we are friends. i like to have close guy friends. clint is cool too. although i have to admit that i found him attractive at first. he isn't hot or anything, but it is something about his personality. i know that he has a girlfriend, but i have ryan too. i love ryan and i wouldn't mess anything up with him for clint. i don't like him that much. my arms really hurt from being on the computer so much. my whole body hurts from exersizing so much latly. i want to loose weight so badly. i wonder how this will be graded, i don't suppose that there is a right or wrong answer, but what if i am writing about the wrong thing. i think i over think things. i wish ryan was here. you know i think that, but i am really not sure if he was here i would like it. i mean there is a certian degree of independence without anyone here. i think that everyone follows their path diferently than others. i mean ashlee is getting married. i know that i don't want to get married, but do i really want to stay with ryan forever. i think so, but it just baffles me how i know that circumstances were different with me then i would be in a sorority and would go out and party a lot. maybe it is good for me to not to have some of the luxuries that others have and it will let me make better decisions. i just don't understand why money makes a person. maybe this is really steriotipical, but i think if you have money you can do a lot of the things that poorer people couldn't do. that sucks. i thought that all people are equal and god gave us all differnt abilities and in the end we are not all alike, but rich in differnt areas of our life. the more that i think about it though i am not sure that is the case. i mean maybe it is true and life isn't fair! that would suck too by the way. i personally think that some of my frinds grew up better that me and therefore they will turn out better than me. kiley is very introverted and wants to go home. that is one thing that i have over her. i don't want to go back to denison. i see austin as a second chance for me and i will break out of the social barrier that i had at home. i mean don't get me wrong, i had good parents that loved me and always gave me the best they could, but my mom wasn't as involved as others were and i think that hurt me socially in highschool. i wasn't in the popular crowd and i am not sure if i want to be.

"my feet really hurt. i wish i would have made that dance team. if that stupid bitch lina had made it, i wouldn't feel so bad. i have always hated her. she is a stupid fat whore who i hope does not succeed in life and ends up as fat as her mother. having an abortion and then denying it, what a lying sack. i hate people like that. i want my computer to work all the time. i am so sick of it being messed up all the time. tracy dropped psychology. damn. i was hoping we could get to know each other by studying together and going to class together. that would be really nice. i need to meet more people here. i like hanging out with all my old friends, but i need to meet some more. those dance girls were all airheads though. maybe it is a good thing that i didn't make it. i would have to around all hose goof ball people all the time. that would kind of suck. man, i wish i could loose some weight. i am not going to if i keep eating all this shitty dorm food. with as much as i work out, i should be loosing weight. why not. mark wants to loose weight just as much as i do, but i guess it is just as hard for guys to loose weight as it is for girls. whatever. i am already tired of this assignment. i guess it is better that having some tight ass paper to write. my rhetoric response paper sucked. i hope i get a good grade on it though. i have to make good grades this year. i will die if i don't. i want to, and my parents will kill me if i don't. not enough time for sex though. i guess when you first start having sex you want to do it all the time. too bad mark doesn't want to. i wish he was just a little bit more of a horn ball. what a weird thing to say. i girl wanting a guy to be a little bit more horny. isn't it supposed to be the other way around? whatever. i really want to have sex now. look what i d id to myself. that girl on the south mall was really weird. there are no hot guys in any of my classes. well at least that i can see. i can't see anyone in my huge ass classes 200540 people. what bullshit! this is such a huge school. it's ridiculous. my hands hurt because i am typing so fast and so much. whatever. need to pop my knuckles. there. i can't believe that ken reynolds died that is crazy 42 years old. that really scares me. if matt calls in the middle of the night one more time, i think i am going to throw the computer at the wall. i love this song ""falling from grace"" it is awesome. it makes me think of a movie. i'm not sure which one though. maybe some drug movie or something. all that reading i have to do. college is way harder than i am wanting right now. i need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. i think tomorrow after mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. i don't know. we always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. i am so excited about the football game. i get to sit with who. let's see. lindsey, mark, and ian, is that it? i can't even remember. oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. man my neck hurts. i need another massage. that felt so good. i can't believe that lindsey has natalie in her rhetoric class. i hope i get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. i need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. this is really not that bad of an assignment. i can handle it pretty well. i wonder who is on the phone. it must be ian. what a weird kid. he is cool though. i am glad to have him as a friend. i wish wes would be a little more open when i try to talk to him. he is nice and i think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. then we are like old friends. who knows about that boy. he has a complex mind. it was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. i'd be his for sure. he was drunk when he said that though. i hope he meant. most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. i don't, but i know some people do. i just want to have some new friends. i think i am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time i see her, we talk for a while. today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. all the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. that sounds like fun. i kind of wish i was in a sorority, but i guess i will live. oh well. there's twenty minutes.

"my name is kate mayer. right now i am feeling extremely uneasy. lately i have been stressing out about everything, from school work to social matters. for instance, this week i have some type of homework due everday this week starting wednesday. last night i worked for five hours straight on homework. i had to make myself take a break and go to kin's corner and eat because i hadn't eaten lunch or dinner, there simply just wasnt enough time. anyway on wednesday i have this huge english rough draft due and the final paper is due on friday. i have a geology test at 8 in the morning on thursday, and i do not work well in the mornings, especially when i am stressed. i try to run in the kinsolving gym to take some of the pressure off me and it helps a little. i just get on the treadmill and go. thinking and making plans for the week and how i can manage my time wisely. i keep thinking that once the weekend comes, i will be okay. i'm going home to visit my family and friends and all my worries will be left here in austin. that scares me a little because i'm afraid i will be dreading coming back here because austin is my home now. that's another thing that gives me a little anxiety. right now i don't really feel that i have a home per say. i know that i am always welcome in victoria (my hometown) but i have a hard time considering it my actual home. kinsolving is my new residence but i feel uncomfortable calling it my actual home. i guess i just have to get used to it. even though i feel anxiety about this small issue, i do not feel much homesickness that freshman are supposed to feel for their parents and friends. i do miss them a lot but i have not been upset by the fact that they are not going to be around me for support or whatever i might need from them. i guess in a way i am really enjoying my independence. i was scared before i came here and i realize now that i am okay alone. there are a lot of times that i need to be with people and socialize but leaving my comfort zone is the best thing that i could have ever done. i have discovered so many things about myself that i didnt know i even had in me, such as my need for independence. right now my roommate just walked in. most people i have talked to tell me that they have spent about two hours with their roommate. i do almost everything withe mine. she is my best friend here. we think alot alike. our room is just the way we wanted it, if not better. there are 11 posters of famous celebrities like marilyn monroe and bob dylan. our room smells of perfume cause we both spray it non stop, not because it smells bad but because. well i'm not exactly sure why. my mind is going blank. thinking. okay there is no air condition in our room or if there is, it is extremely hot in here and we have a fan blowing all the time. i live in supplemental housing so this isn't an actual dorm room-i think it is some kind of storage room-but in any case, i like it here. it feels cozy besides the temperature. im thinking that if i still live here in the winter, i will be okay because it's always hot in here. who knows?! anyway i am extremely tired, it is so hard making myself get up in the morning and go to class. the only reason i get up every morning is because i'm so afraid that i am going to fall behind. actually, i feel that i am always behind. i do not procrastinate, or at least i try not to, but there's just something inside me that makes me feel that there is always something that needs to be done and i cannot slip up and get caught behind. i always leave extra early for things just so i will not be late. i have a math class right after my rhetoric and composition class, which is all the way across campus. i am always late for my math class and it bothers me so much. it scares me to miss the first few minutes of that class because i might have missed some important information like homework or some change in the schedule. i guess you could call it paranoia, i don't know. well, i think that since i've always been this way, i work well under pressure. i don't really like it but, but i'm so used to it. maybe that's a good thing coming to a big university. time's up!!

"right now i feel somewhat tired and weak because of work last night. i'm also feeling a little upset because the eagles destroyed the cowboys 4114 to. and to top it off we lost joey galloway, our best receiver. also troy aikman had another concussion and who knows what will happen next. but on a more serious note i'm a little worried about college. i guess i feel like i have a lot of weight on my shoulders, because i want to prove to my family and to myself that i can make it. school has always come pretty easy to me, but this is college and it worries me. i think once i get the first test out of the way i will be fine. at least i hope i will be fine! i'm also having mixed feelings because i quit my job in order to have ample time for college. things just weren't mixing right so i had i discussed it with my family we decided it was best for me to hold out on working until i got in the grind of college. life has been pretty good lately it's hard to get a schedule with so many things going on. each day is a whole new adventure. some troubles i ran into with college so far were finding a parking place and having to walk ten minutes to my classes. one good thing that has happened though is i have really good classes and professors. i also have people looking out for me and i have made some new friends. ut is like a whole new country there are so many people, places, and things to do. i'm beginning to understand college life. when i first applied to ut i had no idea that it would be like this. i never expected it to be so big and beautiful. everywhere you walk there is something new to see. every building is huge and has something that sets it apart from the others. i guess ut is blown out of proportion with me because i come from a small town of 5000 people. it was a city where the most popular people won everything. but here at ut it doesn't matter who you are. it's like everybody starts over. everybody is giving a clean slate. it's a great chance to prove myself to the people around me, my family, and me.

"well, it's becoming quite obvious to me now that the homework is beginning to pile on, but i'm perfectly okay with that because of all the stuff i went through last year in school. i did one of these for my psy class in high school and i remember some of the stuff i wrote about was quite funny, but hey, it's a stream of conscience. i actually love doing these kinds of things because for the majority of the time, the way we think is a stream, and it's never-ending. i really want to play tennis sometime soon, but today i just don't have the energy. i wonder when i'm going to get physically ill from staying up so late every night, and changing my habits a great deal. i'm getting quite used to the college way of life now. it's rather scary that i'm becoming more and more comfortable with calling my jester dorm ""home"". i definitely miss my bed in my real home. i wonder what else i have to do tonight. i love having all the assignments, tests, papers, quizzes, etc. ahead of time so i can plan ahead and not be able to blame my teacher if i forget something. this is really good for typing practice. i love my schedule, yeah tomorrow's a terrible day for classes, but aren't all mondays terrible. i can't believe my hand is cramping up already. that has got to be a bad sign. sometimes i really am not sure if i'd want people to know my stream of conscience. at times it can make people sound very stupid, like now. i'm very excited i received a call from jeff tonight, he's such a great friend and i haven't seen him or talked to him since i left albuquerque. that's a terrible word to spell, but hey, living there my whole life i should be able to do it in my sleep. oh, sleep, that sounds like a great idea. i am way too tired to do anything, but that's when i need to force myself, and just get into a studying groove. i'm really not looking forward to the noisy people that will be hanging out below my window tonight, playing guitar, singing, talking loudly, until early hours of the morning. then i'll have to call down to the jester desk again and complain. they must hate me by now. i wonder when i follow up for the psy experiments. my roommate has way too much stuff around her desk, but she lets me use her computer, so it's a fair trade. i love typing, although crazy as it may sound, i do. i am just itching all over. i want to go outside, but i really don't feel like leaving the comfort of my room and face the people of jester. i am terribly blind with out my glasses or contacts. i really need to call in my contact prescription tomorrow, so i can actually see. i feel that i've been more tired lately because i haven't had my contacts, and i'm self conscious about my glasses, so it's quite a strain on my eyes, and as a result, i am more tired. i just lost complete track of my thoughts. oh well, must start on a new track, i mean isn't that the purpose of the exercise. speaking of exercise, i really want to get out and run a few laps, i know that it would help in being so tired. i'm tired of the jester food, i've been living off of bagels, not from jester. my roommate just came in and told me something that changed my thought pattern and now i'm concerned with the issue of how guys talk about girls, and how they treat girls. the whole issue is a problem of some sort in everyone's life, i just wish i didn't have to deal with it. i am quite addicted to diet cokes and diet drinks in all, i think i have a serious problem, yet i live for it. i feel like one right now. boy do i need to do laundry. it just keeps piling up, of course the one day i finally decide to do it, everyone else has the same idea. i can't wait to go through the dorm experience, and then move on into an apartment and have things of my own. i wonder if i will have an apartment next year, and i wonder who would be my roomie(s) then, if any.

" for labor day weekend i went home and visited my family. i had to go buy a printer today because my the one i have isn't working so my family came with me to help choose which one would be the best for me to have. they made me go to about five different stores so that i could buy the cheapest one, but the cheapest one was in the first store that we went into. i hate shopping and the fact that i had to go to five different stores to realize that the best one was in the first store made me so mad. i'm excited about coming to ut, but it's a culture shock with five hundered people in my class when i'm used to having about twenty-five. it's really exciting being here though. i miss my friends though. i get to e-mail them a lot, but it's not the same as getting to talk to them face to face. i really like the girls in my dorm though. they all seem to be really friendly and nice. i like my roomate too. i was worried that i wouldn't and would be one of those people trying to get information on how to deal with your roomate. i hear the television on in the living room at my grandparent's house. i wonder what they are watching? i need to figure out how to football tickets for the next ut home game. that would be a lot of fun to go to. i'm kind of stressed out with all this reading i have to for each class. i'm so used to getting worksheets from high school. it's so weird how high school and college are so different. everybody says that, but you never believe them until you get there. i'm having hard time of thinking of things to write down. i'm getting tired from this. i think i'm going to watch a movie at the theater tonight. i love watching movies that you've never seen before; you never know what's going to happen. i missed my dogs since i've been away from them and that's only been a week. i'm so used to having animals around that it's weird to go to my dorm room and not hear a bark at some point. i have a minature doxen, a whippet, and a mut. i also have three cats, but i'm closer to my dogs. i need to go to gregory gym and see what exercise classes i can take there. i also need to see if any one will go with me. i think my grandpa is starting to cook supper. it smells like hot dogs or burgers. i hope he doesn't put a lot of spices on whatever he's cooking. i hate it when he does that. i wonder where my grandma is? she should be back from town by now. who knows. i need to e-mail my friends again before i forget.

"its like you're nothing but your social security number. i don't mind not getting the attention like i'm use to but i do miss the comfort zone. highschool was just so easy. college is just time consuming, especially pledging my frat. i don't understand why people complain about hazing, i haven't been hurt in any way. the one thing that does kill me is the lack of sleep though. four hours a night is not going to cut it. and there is no chance to take a nap because i have so much homework. atleast i'm learning about priorities. i know school must come first and so far i haven't missed a class yet. i want to do good so my father will be proud. i always said i was going to take care of my family when i graduate and now its gametime. i just hope there's no overtime because this first minute of the first quarter is already kicking my butt. everytime i just take a little step, i remember that i've got something else i still need to do. college sucks, but the girls are gorgeous. so i guess i can bear a little stress to meet these girls. i just picked up the phone and it was another salesman. i need to invent a caller-id that says somethimg better than out of area every time somebody calls. i hate these stupid people trying to sell me the national statesman. i keep getting interrupted during this thing and its driving me crazy. it seems like eveytime you sit down to do something somebody always disturbs you. but when you have nithing to do, everybody stays away. i'm telling you, this psycology class has to be a joke because its impossilbe to understand the human mindset. i can't more than 5 seconds thinking about understanding why i do something without getting frustrated. i just hope everything falls into place. i think ut should only let freshman take 9 hours their begining semester because college life is so hard to adapt to.

"i am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to mtv channel. it's playing justin timberlake song. i just got back from my biochemistry i class and the professor in that class seems very boring. i noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because i feel like i missed a lot of what he said while i was taking notes. i can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time. i feel i'm more of a single tasked person. besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and i can hear it's boiling right now and i think i need to check on it before the water boils over. i'll be back. well, i'm back. this week will be a tiring week for me since i have so much to catch up with anthropology reading. i pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means i have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks. my other teachers are okay and i seem to absorb a lot in their lectures. i don't think i can work out much this week and i maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday. plans for weekends are unsure since i haven't made any. hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to. i had already met some people in my dorm, but i haven't really met people in my classes. i also met the people from longhorn pre-pharmacy association. man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and i don't think i can usher again in the football for the longhorn pre-pharmacy since i haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago. i hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible. it's unexpected that somehow right now i feel more energetic than when i was about an hour ago when i was in biochemistry class. maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that i ate about 3 hours ago now is starting kick in. something about the song in mtv just made me looked at the screen. it's r. kelly in a japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because i am from an asian culture. in america, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often. as i'm watching a fighting scene in that r. kelly mtv, i think america has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art. instead, we have other things. i don't feel like listing them right now. it's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows america is diverse and multi culture. speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture. i have a lot to read on the forest people, who are people have very different culture from western and eastern culture. the book is ",0,-0.447746 0.196807 -0.352705 0.041513 0.360864 0.67677 1.274185 0.92656 1.478804 -0.37082 -0.109421 -0.590446 -0.074954 -0.910073 1.537982 0.0 -0.04277 -1.013357 -0.306186 -0.233878 -0.386032 -0.742368 -0.765297 -0.644587 0.008534 0.2236 0.360867 -0.858019 -0.710347 -0.110385 -1.100231 0.185623 -0.896976 -0.416551 -0.352371 -0.667261 -1.388953 1.308875 -0.933701 -1.946869 -0.369538 0.019073 -0.912909 1.683849 2.352101 0.32956 0.343745 -0.718262 0.712078 -1.135345 0.726786 1.116587 0.420499 -0.499181 0.79617 -0.130782 0.097337 -0.954251 0.971704 -0.669638 -0.915066 -0.535307 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.067741 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.434397 0.163566 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.167739 -0.422267 0.420419 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.279506 4.105728 3.639436 4.610332 4.75182 4.342687,2169

"i don't know why. i guess i shouldn't be confused since this assignment is really easy. a sensation i'm felling at this moment is a tingling sensation in my foot since it is asleep. i'm starting to get a little pumped up now because i'm listening to a beastie boys song right now and i really like it. i really want to start dancing. i really love to dance and i'm feeling a little angry at myself because i had chance to go out with my friends tonight but i turned the opportunity down because i have to get up at 9:00am tomorrow because of a class. 9 might not seem early but it is for me since i haven't been getting up until 2:00pm. my hand is starting to hurt now because of the angle i'm holding it to type this paper and it hasn't even been that long. i'm already starting to get tired of this assignment. i feel like i'm going to go to sleep, rrahhh now i have a very irritating itch,. anyway now that my itch is relieved. as i was saying, i feel tired, it could be this assignment is boring me, or it could be that my contacts are bothering me. , actually i'm sure it is my eyes, they really are irritating me. i also feel a little upset because i know i have a couple of spelling errors and punctuation wrong, i hate it when that happens. my foot is now falling asleep, i guess i should change my seating position, but i'm comfortable. i'm just relieved that i can do this writing assignment in the comfort of my room, in my own apartment. i'm glad i'm not in the dorms or at some computer lab. i'm getting excited now because a great song just came on tv. i'm watching a tape of old 80s videos and i love this song. it's great to see the old videos again. my hair is bothering me, it keeps falling onto my ear. i just realized that i really get bothered a lot. rrahhh, my knee is cramped so i finally moved. i wonder how my friends are doing. are they having fun or is one irritating the other? i guess i'll find out later. hip to be square. sorry the song is on and had to type it on and sing along. . just pling along with the music. hey, another typo, what do you know. rrahhhhhhhh i've got about three minutes left to type. at least i'll have it over with. i wish i could do number 2 afterwards. i've got to get everything done soon cause i waited till the last minute all last year and my grades suffered, so i'm trying to get it all done early this semester. i feel at a loss for words now, i keep going through the same emotion, sensations, and feelings. my leg will itch, but mainly i just want to start jamming to the music. alright i'm just about done, and have got a sense of accomplishment. i don't know how long this is but it seemed like it was forever, hey conan is on, i guess i'll cut this off, i've done the time.

"well, write now i guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words i guess. well i had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but i had fun, even though i didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since i usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 6, even though we came home around 430, and i had to get up at 11 because a friend from out of town styed over, so i had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, i lkie so many guys right now, but i think that my other friends like the sme guys that i like, or at least they think he's cute too, but i don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, i guess i'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, i have a lot of homework to do today. actually i need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then i have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but i wish i knew someone else in that class, so i could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if i had any questions, buti guess i should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because i really need to find a study buddy in there. i think that's my only class that i don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so i hope i don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so i kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, i think i may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, i have a minute left in my writing assigment, so i guess that's it ",0,-0.296246 -0.192918 0.190716 0.149094 -0.61127 -2.380021 -1.284839 -0.677736 -0.79875 -0.722979 -0.102838 -0.590446 -0.206981 -0.349196 -0.528783 0.0 -0.04277 -0.028477 0.284954 1.885439 0.808382 -0.742368 -0.629798 -1.12687 -0.624052 -0.947203 0.195923 -0.155366 -0.801787 -0.431348 -1.100231 0.015906 -0.68014 0.84632 -1.017959 -0.054252 0.377097 -0.199788 0.000573 1.011085 -1.038726 2.516845 -2.064894 0.102835 -0.526974 0.319181 -1.093488 1.625409 1.804912 0.151562 2.541878 -1.294242 1.056159 -0.588564 -0.806665 0.220977 0.905458 -0.954251 -0.05265 1.874306 -0.411153 -1.600134 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.493784 2.181324 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.049608 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.329753 5.412085 3.713754 4.986588 4.549311 4.326324,1023
"september 4, 1997 well, here i go beginning my stream of consciousness. i really don't know why i put the date up at top, just that i do that with everything, apologize if it offends you. right now i am freaking out on my foot, which is almost killing me today. i swear i think i have the largest foot blister ever created currently on my foot and its not fun because i can't run, jog and it even hurts to walk on the thing. i have trouble putting on socks because the blasted thing hurts so bad. i'm really beginning to wonder what i did to deserve that, i really don't think i've messed anyone up really bad lately. i've actually been kinda nice lately, which i usually am. well, i guess nice unless you consider what i did on monday night. you see, some people keep calling up our dorm room and asking if its the perry castaneda library. i had been telling them that it wasn't until i got sick of it. so some girl called on monday and asked how long we were open. i told her we'd be open until 12:00 midnight and that if she hurried she could catch us before we closed. i guess it was kinda mean but i also thought it was really funny. well, my hands are already starting to hurt me and that's not good because i have about fourteen minutes left. anyway, i'm starting to get hungry now but i still have more work to do so i figure i'll leave after i'm done with it all, which will take forever. oooh, look at her, i guess i'm definitely going to have to move after i'm done here. oh, by the way, i'm in the smf at the library so i can be easily distracted while i'm doing this. i must confess i do that quite a bit, like the girl sitting next to me in class today, of course, i did listen to the lecture, but it was still kind of a distraction. anyway, wondering what to type now to let you know what's going on in my sick little head. hey, you ever hear why ice is no longer available at the texas a&m cafeteria? the senior who knew the recipe graduated. i have alot of questions like that. for instance, if you throw a cat out a window, does it become kitty litter? if olive oil is made of olives, what is baby oil made of? why is abbreviation such a long word? why do they put braille on atm machines? speaking of blind, what about those signs that say, ""no eye seeing dogs. "" i mean, who's that sign for? the blind man or the dog? at the special olympics, do they have reserved spots for non-handicapped persons? how does the guy who drives the snow plow get to work? why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections? does a radioactive cat have 18 lives? if you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer? if styrofoam packs everything, what do they pack styrofoam in? why is it that you drive on parkways and park on driveways? if nothing sticks to teflon, how do they get teflon to stick on the pan? if alsups is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the door? why is it that whenever you transport something by ship, its called cargo and when you transport it by car, its called a shipment? why do they call it taking a dump when you're actually leaving something? anyway, those are the crazy things that go through my mind. hopefully, i won't be classified as a loony and become subjected to further tests or something. until next time.

"i guess i have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. as i'm writing i keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when i'm supposed to finish typing. i think about what i was thinking in class when you talked to us about this hw and how i wanted to talk about certain things while i was doing. but actually i start thinking about what happened tonight. we all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. i wish my roommate would listen to better music. after capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. we put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. afterwards our president asked us to make this a dry event. i support him 100% because one i don't drink, two i don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three i think that all the points that he made were very strong. my roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. i think that they are wrong anyhow because as president i think that ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and i don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. it was an executive decision. i'm debating whether i should go outside to the pool with everyone else when i'm done with that. i was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but i will see her on monday so i'm still happy. this weekend i have lots of things to do. i'm running through my schedule for the weekend. tomorrow i have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. i keep on thinking about what else i'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. i have never really sat down and typed everything i'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that i type just like i think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. my leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. but after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. we'll see if we actually will keep it but i think we will. i'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. i think about everything else i could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing i really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. i am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though i would still have liked to see my friend tonight. i kind of like this girl but i'm not sure. she's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where i can say that i like her but i do think that she's kind of interested. i also think about my friend who is coming up from southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. we have been friends for a long time and we get along great. but the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so i'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. i know that it can't be too much because i have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time i don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. if anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. we will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. i have the full intention of not having sex. i never have and never will until the day i get married. i have thought about being a priest for a long time so i'm just waiting for god to give me my call and i will follow his will. i really hope that he hurries up though cause i don't have a lot of patience. i think that i have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. i can be patient for certain things but i just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. i know that god doesn't count in that but i try to hurry him up. one of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make god laugh all you had to do was to tell him your plans. i'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. i guess that it all depends on whether you are christian or catholic or simply don't believe in god or have another religion. i realize that there are a lot of people here at ut that simply doesn't believe in god and i think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. i keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. i wish that everyone would be able to believe in god and receive the eucharist everyday. it is the most amazing gift that god gave us. it's sad how some people just ignore god or sometimeseven laugh in his face. this was what i originally wanted to talk about when i was thinking about what i was going to write in this paper. i thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that i can write on but then i realized that i couldn't do that because it would have been planned. so i decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. for the most part i think that it worked because as i think back of all the things that i have written for the past 20 minutes i have gone through various different topics. ranging from drinking, to girls, to god. i think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. i realize that the time is up and that i no longer need to be writing but i'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. i notice that i almost finished a complete page of writing.

"i just don't feel like i have quite gotten into the groove of school yet. i hate that we start before labor day, because i feel like i am just getting my schedule back to normal when i get another vacation. i think i'm going home to see my mom this weekend, my birthday is tomorrow and hers is on monday so were going to have a girls weekend, shopping, makeovers, haircuts, i can't wait. i wish that glenn was coming with me though, i hate to travel by myself, especially flying, i'm glad the flight only takes an hour but i really do not like to fly. i can't imagine going to europe and being on a plane for an entire day, i would want to jump out, it just makes me feel trapped at least when your in the car you can stop along the way for a travel break. anyway, besides getting ready for this weekend, i have a lot of homework i need to finish, so i can have fun while i'm home, my horoscope told me today was a good housecleaning day, i've been needing to do that ever since glenn's party, so i better do it today, or ill have to wait till the next full moon, or favorable planetary alignment!:) i don't really believe in horoscopes, but i still read them, especially around my birthday, silly superstition i guess, my horoscope for this week said i should do something memorable and kind of crazy for my birthday. i'm thinking that's not such a bad idea. i've only got a couple more years left that its still socially acceptable for me to be irresponsible. what crap, i hope i'm doing pseudo-irresponsible (not life-threatening and stupid, just fun) until i'm very, very old. its so weird that i would want to be like that, because i don't think i give off that image to the world. actually taking risks really scare me and i avoid them in real life as much as possible, but my rich a varied fantasy life is full of them. this should give you a clue to how type a i am, my fantasies about taking risks usually just include planning them, hardly ever actually doing them. where was i? oh yeah birthday, so i'm kind of bummed out bc i gave glenn a really great party and bought him lots of presents bc at the time we had money, but surprise his stupid company hasn't paid him yet so right now a great birthday present for me would be to pay the bills. i'm feeling a little guilty about the way i spent money on him, when i sort of knew what the situation would be, but i can't do anything about it now, and i feel like its selfish of me to want him to reciprocate what i did for him. i guess that's my spoiled only child coming out. i really did have fun watching him opening his presents and enjoying his party, i didn't do those thing so he would do the same for me, but i would be nice! okay back to school i'm feeling okay about most of my classes even chemistry, but i do not want to fail calculus again! that would suck, i already dislike the prof's teaching style. i know he wants us to learn by understand the proofs, he thinks that doing tons of problems for practice, which is what i like, is a ""high school"" way to learn, he actually really gets on my nerves. i really don't care about understanding calculus, i don't even have to take the second part, i just want to memorize formulas and pass the tests, too bad it doesn't seen to work like that in his class. i guess if i just keep up with it should be okay, that was my problem last semester, i just kept getting further and further behind, and tried to cram the night before the final. that works in my liberal arts classes, but in none of my science classes, which i guess in a strange way is why i like them. when i enjoying what i'm learning i don't mind reading everyday, and usually by the end of the semester i can really apply what i've learned in broader terms. it was really cool to see that a lot of the methodology and general theories i learned in my ecology classes were also used in psy. calculus is not one of those things i feel like i'm going to enjoy ",1,1.481813 -0.368561 -1.487648 -0.389373 -0.120996 -0.408611 0.411561 0.481663 1.211026 0.46603 0.096772 -0.038669 -0.363824 -0.817765 0.607808 0.0 -0.04277 0.280589 0.616225 -0.187251 0.59974 -0.15142 0.304866 -0.545316 1.659625 0.279759 -0.06167 -0.795202 0.670486 0.535992 0.39353 -0.555534 0.545676 -0.552619 0.664013 -0.79015 0.207755 -0.906173 -0.231924 0.575054 1.377083 -0.551496 -1.64902 -0.358352 0.208698 -1.092065 0.722487 -0.755732 -0.904327 -0.038025 -0.919192 0.180843 0.063605 -0.619574 -0.438649 -0.954142 -0.749224 -0.414148 -0.885009 -0.293516 0.279973 -0.31877 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.144988 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.418044 1.822847 0.050202 -0.23436 -0.373369 0.105479 0.027404 0.170281 0.594368 0.322794 0.04875 0.159606 4.917381 3.53584 4.573101 4.807865 5.104785,459
"as i sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. it has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. ut is the perfect place for me. the diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that i chose to come here. although i am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. today, one year after 9'11'01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. i cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. how will the families of the victims ever heal? my family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and i know my mom still cries at night. that sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on september 11. i cannot even contemplate their pain. i saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and i know this tradegy affected people in different ways. well, september 11 is a day that i will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. however, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. it is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the united states will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.

"today has been a pretty uneventful and boring day. i've been to two of my three classes today. i was starting to fall asleep in my stats class. it's my most boring class of the day. i still have to go to my rhetoric class. it's pretty boring too. i'm not a very good writer at all. i don't much enjoy going to class. i don't apply myself to school near as much as i should. i say i'm going to study but then i put it off until the last second. i guess there are a lot of people that do too. i'm pretty bad though. i don't study hardly at all and make b's and c's. i don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but i do feel stupid for not studying and trying. then i could get all a's and b's. i'm a pretty laid back guy. things don't bother me very easily. but when they do, i can't get them off my mind until their resolved. i live with three other guys. they can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. i have a girlfriend that i've been with for a year and a half. we don't fight very much. she gets mad at me a lot more than i get mad at her. she never use to get mad at me. but then a few weeks before i moved down to austin she started. i think it's because she had stay home and finish school and i got to come down to austin and experience new things. i feel that i don't love her as much as i use to. my twenty minutes is up so i'm going to go to english. this wasn't as bad as i had thought it would be.

"o. k, so now i'm writing for this assignment. i'm going to turn off the music i'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, i like new order. i like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. i'm probably more into that than most people i know. i wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night i ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. i totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and i crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and i hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was ""bamn"" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that i still live at home, i still live at home. i'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but i'd like to have my own place. but i don't have the money for that because i pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but i do feel good when i say that to other people, usually at work is when i do that. i work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. i got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that i could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. i keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a ""how are you"" exchange. things are going better with my parents and i. there was a time before ut,(i'm a transfer from acc)where i didn't really care much about things. probably because i wasn't being challenged, except from work which i enjoyed'enjoy. anyway, i was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob marley type stuff. i have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although i wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. i stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. i wish i was done now. funny because i was looking forward to doing this, but i thought it would be more of a stop'start thought process. it seems like i'm just narrating my last couple of days. i was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and i am somewhat. wish i had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, i have to write for an entire twenty minutes. i wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and ""treated"". i have avg acne, not really the worst i've had. i am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which i assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because i told her that i would clean it last night because i went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason i like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. i have a good view from the office room where i am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that i noticed that, i noticed i'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to gregory gym and how i can't really yet because i am a gimp. not really though, i could easily tough it out, i'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. i knew i'd miss high school for that reason. i like when i repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when i typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. i was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than i had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something i don't really want to do again, or do i? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished.

"okay so i'm just going to start typing. cough cough i wonder how i got sick. did i catch something from joe because he was sick last week but maybe it was from sleeping with the fan on high. oh well i'm feeling better today than i was before. wow it hasn't even been two minutes yet. how am i going to keep thins up for twenty? oh well at least it doesn't really matter what i type. i wish i knew how to type faster. i have to slow my brain down to get my fingers to keep up. stupid geometry book. i hope that i did my homework proofs right. thanks so much mr. knight for not making me do proofs in high school geometry. i'm really not an orange juice fan, but i have to drink it so that i can tell john that i did so he won't worry about me not getting enough vitamin c with my cold. ooh i need to plug my cell phone in i think it's about to die. i'm really glad i called mama today on the bus ride home. i miss her. i wonder what i should get her for her birthday. it seems like it was her birthday just yesterday. this year went by super fast. six minutes down fourteen to go. i'm starting to get hungry. what do i want for dinner tonight? i kind of want to order some chicken wings but i shouldn't they're to fattening and we have tons of food here. i should make something. maybe i'll just heat up some chicken and dumplings. that would feel good on my throat. that tomato soup i had the other day was really good too, even if it was hill country fair or whatever that crazy generic heb brand is. i miss brookshire's and good old hi top brand. nobody here has even heard of brookshire's. i guess it's because their all from houston. fuck houston. houston is not texas. people who say they've been to texas but have only been to houston haven't been to texas. any way doo doo doo dooty doo. i'm seriously running out of thoughts to type. cough cough i need to go to john's to get my roubatusin. i'm fairly certain that's not how you spell that but oh well i never claimed to know how to spell anything. today i saw this girl over near the mlk statue with food in her hands holding it out to the birds and she let pigeons and grackles land on her hand and eat out of it. not only let them but wanted them to. i had to laugh because i realized that girl must not know shit about shit"" to quote the daily show. only five more minutes woo hoo. let's see when i'm done here i should work on my spanish homework but i think instead i'll fill in my new uncalandar. i was so excited when i found it at the co-op today. i had one last year and i loved it. then i went back this year and i couldn't find them. when i saw them today i bought two in case they didn't have them again when i go to buy school supplies next august. okay two and a half more minutes. i wonder if i should stop in mid sentence when tim is up or finish my thought. did it say that in the instructions and i wasn't paying attention? oh well i'll cross that bridge when i get there. i can't believe i forgot to print the confirmation page for my pretesting i hope i get that credit that was one of the most boring experiences of my life i would hate to think it was all for nothing. or naught as john would say.

"right now i am feeling a sense that i have a lot of catching up to do in my reading. not particularly for this subject but for some of my others. my classes thid semester consist of a lot of reading. for the most part i am enjoying school. i think that it will only get better as days go by and i begin to meet more and more people. i am from austin and hardly any of my friends came to ut. i guess that they all wanted to get away from home. i love austin and ut has a wonderful interior design program, it is in the school of architecture. right now i am in the arch. library and my typing is kind of loud i hope that it is not bothering anyone. i am about to go to my next class it is an architecture class with 500 students. most of my classes except for one are with 500 students. (about 500) college goes by so quickly i can't believe that it is already thursday. where does the time go? since i am from austin i have learned that living in austin and attending school in austin are totally different. i am the only family member besides my grandmother who decided to come to ut. most of my family went to texas tech, a&m, and smu. my sister just graduated college from colorado state in ft. collins. i love colorado. my older brother is going to grad school at ut dallas and working at the same time. over the christmas holiday my sister and i are going to quito, equidor, i can't wait. well there is so much i could say right now but i am running out of time. sorry for all of the mistakes.

"it's 2:03. that means i have to write until 2:23. i kind of wish that i had eaten lunch before i started this. is ""kind of"" actually a valid phrase in english? i've heard it used in conversation, but i've never really seen it tuped before. i wonder why we capitalize some nouns like god and english, but not others like god and bicycle. the people down my hall are really loud and obnoxious. i'm not quite sure what they are doing now, but it involves a lot of bumping around. they had a picture of some female anatomy on their wipe-off board for a couple of days, but it's gone now. i'm really glad because it was pretty offensive. i wasn't about to say anything about it to them, though. who am i to tell them what they can display outside their door? now i hear multiple guys laughing. i really don't like it when guys are in the dorm. it makes me really uncomfortable. i feel like i can't really go on with my regular living processes. i'm always afraid that if i take a late shower, i'll be coming down the hallway in my purple bathrobe, and there will be some strange guy standing there. i'm really into my privacy. that's why i chose an all girls dorm. besides, a lot of girls get really stupid and bitchy when they are around guys. last night when i was getting off the elevator with a friend, two girls from that floor were getting on. my friend and i were laughing at something she said, and one of the (not very nice) girls thrust her head out of the elevator and said ""do you have a problem?"" in a very threatening tone. i just laughed at her and said no. then she said, ""i didn't think so. "" then why the hell did you ask if you didn't think so? it sort of desturbed (wrong spelling, geez i hate that) me to think that someone was that bitchy where i live. i also feel sorry for her that she is so insecre that something like that would set her off. my mind goes faster than i can type. sometimes i worry that my writing is not sophisticated enough. i guess now i worry that my thought processes are not sophisticated enough. my roommate keeps trying to set me up with her friend. he's a nice guy, but the thought of getting together with him makes me a little sick. perhaps it's the dirty notes he keeps leaving on my bed when i'm not here. i'm not used to people being that upfront about sex. i noticed that sex is a big interest for psychologists. the first questionnaire i filled out had a substantial section on sex. i wonder if you guys are actually going to read this, or if i am writing this for my own benefit. if the latter is true, i'm not going to get much out of this. i write like this all the time; it's called a journal. it is slightly more enjoyable than many other alternatives i can think of, though. you're never supposed to end a sentence with a preposition. i wonder why that is. i rather like it. maybe because i'm not supposed to do it. well, it's 2:25 now, so i guess my requirement is up. besides, there's nothing more i can think of.

"my main thoughts right now consist of music. i am thinking of a new song that i wrote about my thoughts on the people that i have seen at ut. music i feel is the greatest thing in the world because i get to release all my emotions through a song. i think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. these reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. i don't believe any of them write their own songs, so i can't see why people would think they are talented. this brings me to something else i do not like about people, they are generally fake. what i mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. for example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. this things i do not do and hopefully never will. i feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. i thought by coming to ut that i would see less of this type of attitude from people but i now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. from this point i would like to say that ut is great(except for parking)and that i do like more people here then i did in high school. i am not sure what i want to do with the education i am receiving from this school but i hope that very soon i will recognize my calling in life.

"and so know i begin my first assignment in psychology. i don't know exactly how to begin this but i'm giving it my best shot. typing isn't my forte so this is going pretty slowly. my roommate just walked in and then right out as soon as i told him what i was doing. wow, there's something on the screen besides solitaire! he must be thinking. i hope my computer gets fixed soon. it'll be so much easier being able to send this through the internet from my dorm rather than going to the smf lab and waiting for an open computer. they should have come to fix it by now. i guess they have a lot of people to help considering that i've called them two or three times already. and when the ethernet starts working that will be awesome. lightning fast access; no more waiting and waiting and waiting. . at least the phone lines are up and running ( in my room anyway). and not only that i got two free phone cards on the street today. i love it when they just hand out free stuff! uh oh, i just heard some cars screeching outside but i can't see anything from my window. i hope they're o. k. i can't leave this keyboard! hmmmmm, i just got writer's block and i'm writing through my stream of consciousness. i wonder if that's bad. i just got a song in my head but it's not like i can write down the notes ( it's instrumental ). my gum is losing its taste, i think that i might need a new piece soon. it's winterfresh gum. it's my favorite. i don't exactly know why it's my favorite gum, but maybe i'll find out in this psychology class. psychology is a kind of hard word to type and it takes a little longer that some of the other words. my roommate just turned on some music. its called prodigy, the group that is, and they play electronic music. it sounds pretty cool, i think i'll go listen to it.

 right now i am sitting at the computer feeling very good that i am finally doing this assignment. it had been on my mind ever since it was assigned. i can't wait till i am done. because i know i will feel a sense of accomplishment . ever since the lecture on tuesday every time i think i can picture that video we saw in class where the part of the brain was warming up or so called cooking. i imagine my brain is cooking right now trying to think of what to write next. earlier today i found my emotions changing alot today and i tried to figure out why they changed so much at one point i was extremely shy and the next minute i was outgoing. right now i feel very comfortable with myself and extremely confident. my thoughts are going every which of way right now. because i feel pressure to do well in school from myself and my parents. i really would like to please them and show them i am responsible and smart. i feel as though it is not me right now. i find it truly fascinating that my mind is coming up with some of these things right now. i find it really intriguing. now even after going to class i really feel like hearing the lectures really has made me realize alot of stuff i had not noticed before especially trying to feel what i really feel not what i just think i feel. it just occurred to me that i have not looked up once to see how much time has gone by. i could write this for a while just tracking my different thoughts and feelings and emotions. when i mentioned something earlier about my parents and how i wanted to impress them. i pictured my parents and started having feelings of love because i know they are there for me if i need them. i never have stopped and traced my thoughts before until now. i am wondering now if the tests are going to be hard in this class. i feel pretty hungry right now so i can imagine my stomach relaying something to my part of my brain telling me it is time to eat. i wish i could get controller the part of my mind that controls addiction because i sure would like to quit smoking. i feel as if i have no control over it anymore. when i smell cigarettes smoke. i feel my mind say wouldn't it be nice to have one of those. i guess quitting smoking is telling that part in your mind no and to be stronger than that. that was weird how my mind suddenly brought up smoking i guess because i know i have to quit because it is so bad for you. well that's time i really enjoyed this assignment. ,0,0.602538 -0.291276 -0.189043 -0.6514 -0.060235 0.351424 1.282173 -0.261111 -0.648166 -0.707832 -0.119897 -0.590446 0.005537 1.336523 1.767231 0.0 -0.04277 1.190564 1.774485 -0.46317 1.747492 -0.096589 -0.636696 0.636236 -0.624052 -1.727562 0.361819 -0.497193 -0.823241 -0.044319 -0.120817 0.96055 -1.133606 0.252569 -1.017959 -1.109326 2.582074 2.623399 1.642514 -0.780322 6.089156 -0.342341 -0.360669 3.645992 0.360699 0.303826 5.285156 -1.163553 -0.021248 -0.882212 -1.34699 1.911189 0.886763 0.172235 -0.518558 -0.901782 0.504935 -0.954251 -0.693745 -1.180643 -0.423761 1.340398 -0.480161 -0.175133 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.292692 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.426902 -0.451544 -0.033792 -1.554528 5.098384 3.634123 4.75853 5.07553 4.064421,178
"okay. i don't really know what to write. being timed really makes me nervous no matter what i have to do. i have to study for chemistry. and my roommate is standing over my shoulder. which makes me even more nervous! ahh! hmm, what am i going to become when i grow up? i don't know if i have what it takes to become a doctor! and my dad wants me to become an architect now! oh geeze. i think i'm just going to have to give this all to the lord. oh lord! anyway, there's so many things i have to do. but all i really want to do is nothing. isn't that a classic? i feel like i'm getting fatter, and i know that i shouldn't be worrying about getting fat since most people consider me average and say that i'm already skinny enough, but i think that being in a ballet company my jr. year of high school really messed up my mind. they told me to lose 5 lbs or more, and now i'm always so concerned about my weight. ahh, i love ballet, but i don't think i'll ever want to really become a professional ballerina. even though my ballet teacher really really wants me too! i'm really hungry right now. i want to eat some more mexican food. mmm. mexican food. too bad there's nothing good to eat in the fridge downstairs. bummer. oh lord help me! i think i'm starting to get really homesick now; i miss my mommy and my daddy. but most of all, i miss my brother! i want to go to california! i want a big cold front to come in soon. i can't stand this hot humid weather anymore. even though i'm used to it (since i'm from houston). my back hurts. i think it's from trying to work out on my roommate's torso track. actually, every part of my body hurts right now. i wish someone in the house knew how to give really good massages right now because i could really go for one right about now. i'm dead tired too. but i can't go to sleep since i have to study for my stupid chemistry quiz tomorrow. ughghh. i hate chemistry so much! and what makes it suck even more is that i'm such a terrible student. i wish i was diligent with my studies and all, but i just can't seem to manage my time right! and i can never seem to set my priorities straight! oh lord! i'm such a failure! i have so many weaknesses and shortcomings it's awful. is my time up yet? oh darn. i still have a ways to go! i want to go to sleep! my eyelids are drooping. i guess i should have been smart and done this a little earlier. but like i said i don't manage my time efficiently. i wonder if the person reading this is actually reading this carefully or just breezing by it to see if i actually did the assignment and put some effort into it. do you call this effort? because it is. it really is. i think i'll go to the architecture library tomorrow. hmm. i hope that cute guy's there! ha! (like i'm going to do anything really. i'm actually really well preserved. i'm a preserved vessel never dated, never gone to a party, never done drugs, smoked, drank. never done any of that stuff. and it's all because i love the lord, and i want to be ""well pleasing in his eyes"". therefore, i must present my body as a ""living sacrifice to him"" because. it should no longer be "" i who live, but christ who liveth in me"") oh. i'm so ready to stop now! i want to go shopping! but i feel so poor! i am poor actually. i don't have any money. and neither does the rest of my family. we live on scraps. i guess you could say! i'm so glad we could afford to send me to college! but my brother and sister will have to slave to help finance my way through these 4 years. oh lord! yea! my time's up!

" i am finally taking a break from doing my math homework. i am so excited to finally be doing nothing. i am so excited that i finally got my laundry back because now i do not have to worry about it, but i do need to do a load of some personal items. while looking around my room i see my side pretty neat and then i look at my roommate's side and it is a pig-sty. it bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere, when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed. maybe we will have a talk about that later? who knows. but i cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend, but that's one more day that i don't have to go to class. i love living here at towers but the walls are paper thin. i can hear anything and everything that my roommate'suitmate say and sometimes that's okay but when i'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me. oh well, life could be worse. i wonder what else i have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow? i think i need to go to allie's room at some point to get her notes from philosophy that i missed last week, and i really need to go return a book to the co-op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad's name on it. why would they do such a thing? oh well at least it won't be too hard to fix. at least i hope it won't be too hard to fix. i am so tired but i got so much sleep last night and i don't understand how i'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today? it makes no sense to me. maybe i am still transforming into the ""college-life-style"" and i'm just not used to it yet? i'm getting very sleepy but there's no point in trying to take a nap because i know it won't happen for me. i love how i have so many pictures around my room because everywhere i look i am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home. speaking of home, i feel like so many people are going home this weekend. as much as i would like to go home, i don't think i'm quite ready to leave here yet. i don't think i'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already. even if i did go home my parents wouldn't be there because they are going to the lake. i wonder if i will see them at all since they'll be so close to me now? maybe i will call them later and ask. oh and i need to call mimi back since she left me a message yesterday. i'll call her later when i have a few minutes to spare since i know the conversation will last for a lifetime. or i guess i should say it will last for a long time. it's amazing how i was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and i'm left alone again in quietness. i will most definitely take advantage of that alone'quiet time, but then again sometimes i do get bored sitting here by myself. they asked me if i wanted to go eat with them but i just ate a few hours ago, i might as well save my meals for when i'm actually hungry right? wow, looking up at the clock i never realized how long twenty minutes really is. i feel almost out of breath because i've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes. my sister just called but i have to call her back. she didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend jessi would be searching for jessi's car anyway. so i wonder what happened to it? did she park somewhere and forget where she left it? weird. i hope i never do that. although it would probably be hard for me to do that since i've only driven my car twice in two weeks. i wonder if that's bad for it? maybe i need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works? i should probably ask my dad about that. so its only four oclock in the afternoon and i feel like its ten at night. why is that? well i just hope i keep up with everything as much as i'm ""supposed"" to because college is definitely not like high school. high school is like a joke compared to what i've experienced in only 5 days. oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks. so about winter break. i cannot wait to go home because i think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again. i'm sure ill see most of my friends over thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the ""old gang"" will probably be christmas break. that will be a fun break, and i know it will be great seeing everyone again. i wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip? hmmm there's another thing i need to check into because i don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute. especially since my best friend who lives in virginia will be in houston for part of the break. if i missed her because i was on a family trip i would be extremely upset so i need to figure it out to make sure i will be around. wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe i should go get some coffee from downstairs? sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it's kind of of sore. i think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather. i can't wait to fully recooperate so i can feel 100% again. then hopefully i will be in a better mood and not so irritable? hopefully! well now getting back to the matter at hand, this assignment. although it has been time consuming, it's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life. wow and that's saying a lot!!! i am so interested to see what our next assignment is like, since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again. our class is huge and i actually saw a second person that i know yesterday when i was walking out. speaking of i should probably call that friend of mine. well it looks to me that i just glanced up and this assignment is over! yay :-) ",0,-1.24342 -0.223709 -0.176214 0.05807 -0.239112 0.968818 -0.342055 -0.522004 -0.352395 2.151089 -0.112107 2.398346 -1.545581 0.395191 -0.265378 0.0 6.279842 0.128973 0.197626 0.114434 0.239327 -0.742368 -0.222549 0.096979 -0.331226 -0.451049 0.772171 0.179288 -0.494634 0.016191 -0.717154 1.00105 -0.807137 -0.226286 -0.863908 -0.290792 0.16062 1.61925 -0.40064 0.283333 0.20035 0.153598 -0.465122 1.370974 0.846156 1.20175 0.237111 -0.333145 0.524398 -0.396561 -0.93558 1.024397 -0.104069 -0.337017 2.806773 -0.09346 -0.508112 0.084576 -0.648987 -0.345378 0.31354 -0.285703 -0.480161 0.14668 -0.546834 0.427867 -0.086094 -0.890103 -0.735793 0.005746 -0.23436 1.646908 0.138214 0.247127 0.717432 0.264961 -0.451544 0.17789 -0.461787 4.270933 4.019368 4.929599 5.265778 4.119425,2350
"sometimes i wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, i guess living in general. what is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. i wonder if that was his plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. in a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. as a follower of the times, my faith in him has also declined as the years have gone on. well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. as i entered high school, i was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. but i realized that life is only as big as you make it. if you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. but back to my point. i made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as i've moved to the next step in my life. my five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that i knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. don't get me wrong, i am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but i don't think that i realized what i was losing. my best friend with whom i spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. i didn't realize how much i would miss him until he left. when i see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. my girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. i knew leaving her would be most difficult, but i underestimated the pain. i miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. i feel like i don't know her as well as i used to and i wonder if i ever will. the leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. i guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, i don't know. anyhow, i wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. but for now, i guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive!

"i don't know what i should be doing right now. i mean life is so complicated and strange to me. my father says i can do whatever i want to at university and he will be happy with it, but the thing is if i do what i want then he would be pretty upset with me. hell, he would disown me. i don't know why i have to do things in order to please him but i have to. its like i have no choice. i am just starting to get his trust back and i don't want to lose that little bit that i have. you could say that i'm destined to do what other people want me to do. that is the way that society is these days. we are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow; and if we don't conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society. the ""norm"" they call it. why does there have to be a ""norm"". i don't see why we can't live the way that we choose and be free. oh well, back to happy thoughts. amanda. there is a happy thought. i wonder. i wonder what? i don't know. i guess i wonder if it will work. i'm nuts about he she is nuts about me, but we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. i guess that is true about a lot of couples. but i still don't know. what i do know is that i want to stay together, even though everyone is talking about us. i don't care how old she is. hell, she is only 2 years younger that me so that doesn't matter. people are just making a big deal out of it because i am in college and she is a sophomore in high school. she is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me. she understands a lot of things. i guess that is because she grew up in saudi. people there are generally more mature than people here in the states. we are forced to grow up faster than people here. we lose our innocence faster, and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker. lets leave it on this note. these are strange days that will challenge our true selves. i wish i could go deeper than that but i'm not going to spill all of my guts to a computer. later babe.

"well, since my friend just told me how she neglected to get us these free random glow in the dark condoms, i've got sex on the brain, not that i've even had sex before. it's just one of those things that jumps in my head two or three times a day. i think it's because it's one of those unknown things i haven't experienced yet. i really wish i was back at home sitting on my bed, with my dog at my feet, waiting for my brother to come in and keep me up talking about my poor relationship problems which i still to this day haven't figured out. i miss him, my boyfriend' friend' player' love or whatever. all i know is that i had fun with him no matter what was going on in my life. he could and still can always make me laugh. i miss that. i just plain miss him. and i'm not saying that i never once thought of having sex with him but it was never a real issue. he made me smile and never upset me. well, that's not completely true. sometimse he upset me but it wasn't his fault. unfortunately, i loved him a lot more than he loved me even though he really and truly loved me a lot. sometimes i wonder if he is gay. i know that sounds odd but maybe . no forget it. i'n so exhausted and all i want to do is go to sleep in my own bed under a real homy roof. i know it sounds funny becaouse they're probably all asleep but i wonder what they're doing- my family and john and my other long lost friends who off at some far away college. poor jonathan is out at sea. i hope it's not raining on him. the food here is good but i don't like having some one tell me when i have to eat and when i can't. there is no refrigerator with blue bell stuffed in the back. and most of all, there is no arlington dance academy. oh, guys i wish i was there to teach my little kids and have them run up and hug my leg. i wish i had my senior class back cause i have so many great ideas from new pop songs i've heard here in austin. why can't i just skip the whole college thing. i know ican do it and i have the abiltiy and the committment to finish, ijust don't think i need to . i want to run a dance studio . i need to be going to conventions and new york and watching my previous dance instructor run the agenda and show me the accounting not learning about some stupid coorporations that i'll never want a job from or need an interview from. i just want to do what i've been doing best for the last 15 years and that is choreograph real dance in my own studio with my own ideas and expectations. it's my dream and its getting away from me. school seems second now and i really don't care. i've put it first most of the rest of my life. i did my 18 years now i want my career, my dream. i still want to dance myself but that is possible except not here in austin where most of the studios are for elementary and the directors are real snots. people should want you to dance with them especially if you have a good attitude. but my bed is calling to me and i still have some very important e-mails to take care of. it's so nice to know that some people care enough at least to type.

"right now i'm thinking about not that much. i'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. i'm thinking about how i miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. it's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. he's just sitting there playing a video game and i'm really excited, but yet i still miss him and think about him. it's a rather cool feeling. i'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. i've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd i still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. i'm thinking also that i want to listen to music. music relaxes me a lot, and i really enjoy listening to it will i'm doing mindless things. i enjoy it at other times too. i'm also craving sweets a lot. i'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. i'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in houston. prior to this i read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 30th weding anneversary, but i couoldn't really htink of where it is. i'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. earlier in teh day i watched hte first half of hte texns game, so i'm also wondering if they won or not. my sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and i'm wondering if any day things willl get better. it's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so i'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what i can do to make it better for her. randomly i also think about my parents. i just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. normally i wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before i moved up here, so i think about him a lot more htat i probably would. my email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. i'm also thinking about my math class. i have homework to do in tehre later tonight. i really don't like the calss. it's riddle math, so i spend my time wondering about how i'm going to get thropugh there. currently i m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. ther are no equations, so it drives me crazy. i really don't want to even look at my homework. it's about the only homework i've procratinated on since i ve been here. i'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. i have dizzyness problems, and i'm trying ot think of a time when i can see a doctor. my sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. now i'm starting to feel stressed. usually i don't feel stressed, but then again i usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. i'm wondering if i can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. it's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. i'm also trying to figure out when i'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. i've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. but now m going to go to a store tommorrow to finally get something. but i'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that i can get. i've never been to this store, but at 5 tommorrow i will find out about the stuff int ehre. according to my firned she says that i'll be able to find stuff there. hopefully i will, otehrewise i'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd i'm constantly worrying about money. i am botehrd especially when i have to pay for unneccessary things. which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. i'm also thinking about what position i would like to run for. earlier today i went to an rha meeting. unfortuantly i missed the first half, so i didn't get all the information. i'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if i want to be an ra next year. the other positions seem like high positions where i would have to campaign a lot, and i m not that type of person. i'm still worrying somewhat about if i would have to campaign for my wing thing. i really would preffer to do that, i just hope i don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. kind of like the girls who i think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. those eveil people. everytime i go to the bathroom, i really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. rather unfair. but i really get annoyed even when i see them. i've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. i m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. i needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. the noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. i'm not much into video games, unless i get to shoot something, but i still wonder what's going on over there. or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. the same screen, all day long. i've wondered if it actually fries people's brains when they play. or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. the noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. i'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. supposedly it's only one hour, but i wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. i'm not sure if i'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. i'm not sure how to tell my best friend if i dont' want to play. i do want to play, i just don't know if i'll have the time. but i also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. so that is a rather hard argument. why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. i want to just expand time, and do everythign i want, and stop rushing through it and ",0,-0.39811 -0.319857 0.122977 -0.812254 -0.661813 0.553386 -0.434786 -1.034684 -0.172841 2.196529 -0.133599 -0.590446 -1.330914 -1.220943 0.386642 0.0 -0.04277 0.09993 0.352179

"i don't know what to do with my boyfriend. i am so distracted by him and i should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in college. i don't really feel that great today. i really feel like taking a bath. it would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. i wonder eho the package is from that i got. it is really stupid that i won't be able to pick it up until tuesday. my room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. i miss my roommate already. maybe i should have gone home this weekend. oh, well i guess my weekend is going ok because i got to see both jared and eddie yesterday and that made me happy. i miss jared right now. i wish my siter was here. we would have so much fun. i heard that she already took over my room. i don't really know what i think about that. i don't know how i am going to get all my work done, i can't believe i slacked off sp much and i would have had all my stuff done already. oh well, i guess next time i will do better. i hope that i will be able to get my application to the texas spirits this week so i can start meeting people. maybe i should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. hopefully with the things i am attempting to join i will be able to meet some more peope. it is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. all my frinds from high school were pretty much people that i had been friends with since catholic grade school. making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many difference places. ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere i have been before. except for new york city, i guess. but i guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and i guess that is prety hard to comprehend. i wonder ho jennifer is at lsu. the last time i talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. i hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. so far, it seems like kristen and colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. i haven't talked to sarah at all , i hope she is doing ok. i wonder if she has met wes yet , i bet they would get along really well. this wirting is completely all over the place. i am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so i guess i can end my rambling.

"i am twenty-two years old and i still have apprehension towards computers. i don't really know why. i guess it is because of my lack of experience with them. i am also worried about the pre-testing. i tried to access the site but it would not let me connect. my boyfriend just told me that he thinks it is stupid that a class is relying on computers so much. at first i agreed with him, but as i am typing this, i am beginning to think that it is sort of cool. speaking of my boyfriend, he is currently in his kitchen heating up leftovers. i can smell them and it makes me sick to my stomach. oh well, i will get acclimated. i have something on my mind. but first i would like think about my day and my new major. well, i changed my course of study, but not really. for the past two years i have been in the school of architecture. i love buildings and i love to design. i sacrificed a lot to get into the school and not to mention adding on three extra years to my college life. it was such a major decision. well, i just entered into a new course of study, it is architectural interior design. the interior design program moved into the school of architecture so they beefed up the program and gave it prestige. back to my boyfriend. i feel like i had an emotional affair with his best friend. that really sucks. i can't seem to get the other guy out of my mind. i am even having dreams about him. i e-mailed him today. it was a big step ",1,1.583144 0.169527 -0.897563 -0.268477 -1.485321 -0.398206 0.666533 1.297751 0.632602 -1.453802 -0.208225 -0.590446 1.130122 0.207623 0.602877 0.0 -0.04277 1.640615 1.180094 -0.795527 1.030862 -0.742368 0.861808 -0.052933 0.636728 0.596186 0.798299 0.692275 -1.103047 -1.314572 1.373812 -0.625441 -0.155807 2.020637 0.308596 -1.109326 -1.055245 -0.793457 -1.114189 -0.761967 -1.038726 -0.731521 -2.064894 -0.93226 -1.429535 -0.298844 -0.377367 0.202929 1.20746 0.003618 -0.75654 -0.747775 0.532251 -0.179189 -1.202879 -0.510013 1.038253 -0.954251 0.058081 -0.819853 -0.918624 1.229545 -0.480161 1.174821 0.408025 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.653663 -0.010944 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 1.172128 -0.422267 -1.257277 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.139924 4.986928 4.195688 4.4028 4.975411 4.99157,475
"wow. what an assignment. i think this has got to be one of the easiest grades i have ever made. i am feeling a bit like doogie howser (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). i am typing this in microsoft word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 4 times. although i have physics tomorrow, which i have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. i am feeling relieved because i had this huge paper due in my freshman seminar class today and i worked my ass off for it and i feel good about it. i am not all that great of a writer but i think i will get a decent grade on it. plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. by the time i am completely finished with the paper i am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, i suppose. i think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. i have a friend, olga, who has gone through like 12 journals in the past 3 years. she tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. which reminds me, i need to give her a call. i miss her. she goes to southwest texas. i am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (michael linford). we are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. well. i thought it was a bit humorous. i am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and i actually live in the same city now. it is a really good feeling. we met last year, here in austin at debate camp. he is from colleyville (dallasfort worth), so we spent just under a year living 4 hours apart from each other. all of my classes are going pretty good, although i still don't really have a clue what i want to major in just yet. i am in the college of liberal arts (woo hoo!) and i was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. i also want to go to law school. i seriously doubt i will get into ut's law school. it is way too competitive. * sigh * who knows, i sure don't. i am living at dobie right now, and let me tell youi am getting ripped off. it is $7000 a year and i have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because i live on the 2nd floor (the ""intensive study floor""), which i never signed up to be in. i guess it isn't all that bad though; at least i'm not at jester. i don't have a car here because my parents are irrational. i have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a ""growing experience"" for me. although i only live around an hour or so away from here (schertz, tx. near san antonio) i haven't been home since i have been here. i have no real desire to go home. i hated high school, well i hated it my senior year. all my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. i guess that is one of the reasons why i feel i can't compete with some of the people here at ut, my high school didn't have much to offer. i have a good friend of mine (shala) that came and saw me the weekend before last. she is at unt and she hates it there. although i miss her, i think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. she has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn't give her the time of day for the last 6 years of her life. jocks and whatnot. supposedly there is this annoying kid (who i started to resent in high schoolscott hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. scott and i were buds back in 8th grade and once we got to high school, i no longer existed. that happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. back to shala, well she told me yesterday that she has ""found god. "" if only you knew shala, you would know that is a load of shit. if she is happy, then hey i am all for it, but i don't think it is something she'll stick with. i am not an atheist or anything but i just don't know and don't care to find out. i am not saying i won't be open to opinions and respectful of one's commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. i guess that is because of my parents. they use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn't let me go out or do anything on sundays unless i went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) alright. i have far surpassed the 20minute limit and i'm out.

"right now i'm thinking what i am going to write about. i am so tired and so ready for this weekend. i just worked four or five days straight and now i get the whole weekend off. so i am so excited, yet so exhausted. school is fun yet is hard to keep up with all the readings for every class all the time. i don't know if i doing anything right or not. if i actually understand what each class is going to be like or if i will succeed in every class. tomorrow i have a full day off with only two classes and the rest of the evening to do whatever. finally a night to do whatever i want to and enjoy the college life and atmosphere. explore what ut has to offer. i need to talk to my teacher that i am an aide for by next wednesday, when am i going to have time to talk to her throughout my busy schedule. all the books piling up on my bed. things i need to get done today or at least by this weekend so that i am caught up for classes next week. finally next weekend i will be abl3e to go home. able to see all of my friends that i have not seen in probably 2 months. i am trying to be as quiet as possible so that my roommate can study and do whatever she is doing without me bothering her. i need to go shopping for some food for my dorm so that i actually have something to eat. guess i'll probably go there tomorrow and find things that i will need and also eat. what am i going to do this weekend with all the stuff going on in austin. am i going to stay here or should i head back home? what should i do. guess i'll see what i feel like this when this weekend comes. gosh. i wish this time would be almost up so that i can get on to studying for my classes that i actually have tomorrow. i have so much to do yet so little time. hmmmm. this pink lemonade that i made is kinda tangy, maybe needs some more water. i just feel like i have so much energy right now that i could do anything. i need to make some calls to the people i have not talked to in a while and just catch up on everything that is going on. my ffet are cold. guess i better go put on some socks. my ass is also getting kinda sore from sitting on this hard wooden chair that the dorms provide. i probably need to get a pillow so that i can sit here longer. dang my room also needs to be cleaned. it seems like the dust takes only a couple of seconds to land and make everything look dirty. the blue rug sure is starting to look sad. guess i need to go borrow the vacuum cleaner downstairs so that i can get it looking better. the room also feels like it is getting colder. i sure need to go shopping. sooon. but i have no money. i need to get some money from my parents. how i sure do miss having them around and having everything paid for. the room is so bland and plain. the green ugly tack board thing could use some decoration. i wish people wouldn't have to come see my room on friday. maybe i won't be here when they come or maybe i might make it a point not to be here since at least my side looks pretty drab. my biology book is sure bigger sitting on the shelf than i realized. i sure need to catch up in that class since i really don't like biology. next friday when i get out of class i need to have my stuff packed up so right after i can head home. i can go visiting and then go to homecoming to see everyone. i don't think i will stay long, because i might feel awkward being in college and going to a high school football game. people might look at me weird. i don't like when people stare at me. i need to sign and fill out this form for my nursing class, it will be due pretty soon. i just don't feel like doing any of it. what should i do this weekend. its so confusing. what should i do. wow. i didn't realize all the room that i still have left on my shelves, i can still store a lot of more stuff on them. i sure have not played a game lately. i wish i could find someone that knows how to play dominoes, i really wan tot play dominoes with my brand new ones. i'm getting so bored, wandering around the room trying to think about other things that i need to get done, abll the stuff to do and so little amount of time to do it.

"well, i suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did i wait this long to get assignments like this done. i always put a lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off. i haven't been doing in college so far, but i know if i was more productive with my time i'd be better off. that and money. i haven't been very good with money lately. oh, i have plenty to live on, but i spend a lot of money on things i simply don't need. i also tend to spend money unwisely, like buying things somewhere when i know i can get them somewhere else much cheaper, but i buy it anyways because it's there and convenient. i don't have any income right now eithher, i need a work-study job, but that shouldn't be too hard. i've already paid my rent for the semester, and so a job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine. i've got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people, too. the unfortunate thing is, it's getting to a point where it's almost a home-run business, and i'm beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue. i hate filling out forms, much less loads of tax forms. i'm only 18, and it's a thing i do on the side to make extra money, and i don't know if i should be concerned with such a thing as business tax forms and accounting. i've only done three small commerical webpages . . i don't know if that excuses me from anything. i need to talk to some expert about that. money is no object to me, in the end, though. that's probably why i'm so careless about most of it. i have been keeping a pretty tight track of it, though, just to make sure i don't go broke. i'm looking at buying a computer, and i think i have just enough. my work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses. i also spend a good bit on music, which is something i'm really into. not music in general, mind you, but just the stuff i listen too. a lot of it is fairly obscure . . i'm not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure. i listen to a good bit of forgotten artist's stuff, like albums they release after they've had their heydey - which is usually in the 80s. i listen to music basically all the time. my roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time, sometimes i wonder if he minds, but i don't think he does. we have a guitar in our room, and it's my roommate's. he doesn't play it too often, only a bit now and then. he's decent. i don't know anything, though. i'm not muscially inclined, personally, in any way. i don't sing or play any insturments, though i wish i did. something like keyboards or drums would be cool, but i've been learning to apprecaite the guitar more. i like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make. steve hackett, when he was a guitarist for genesis way back when, is a great example. i heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized, and as a result, he played some interesting solos. he made the band sound a little more floyd-ish i guess. still, that's the kind of guitar i'd like to learn to play. acoustic riffs would be neat to learn, too. the keyboards would be tough, but i'd think the most fun to play could be the drums. drummers have a lot of different styles, i've noticed. i wouldn't leanr to play really fast and make a lot of noise, i would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesn't take just speed, but lots of skill, too. i don't know how most bands play it now a days, but drums don't always particularly stand out in some songs now a days, but i guess a lot of them don't hold that as important. when phil collins was drummer for genesis, the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out. not because they were loud, neccessarily, but because they were different with what you usually heard. they didn't go along with the song, they would almost lead the song. really, though, all of the members of the band genesis make it such a great band, which if you haven't caught on by now, is my favorite band. i'm getting a little tired and i have lot more reading and some homework to do. tomorrow is monday and classes start up again. fun.

"well, i don't know where to begin. i guess it started when she came over for lunch. i never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. she swooped in and plopped herself on my new pappason chair. she was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. as she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the hit or miss store i noticed it. how her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. i mean, don't get me wrong randy is the best friend i have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. as she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. it was barely noticeable that my over grown lab dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. then the words just fell out of her mouth. ""he's come to rescue me, and i'm going to go. "" i have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. i was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. my best friend was on her way to her life long dream. all i could do was cry and hug her. then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. there was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and celebrate! wow. she's gone. what is left of me? i sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. i mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. i don't know how long. it seems like a whole season passed. then one day, i got tired of crying. i knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and i'd be darned if i was going to let it rot inside of me. so, i did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. i joined a club. i went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. but you know what, i didn't find it. so, i began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. i left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. but, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what i'm going to do? i'm going to meet myself a man. i will find out what love is all about, and i mean real love. so, take that! thus, my man hunt began. i browsed the video dating services, the internet (big mistake, huge), i scoped men at the grocery store, i bought some roller blades and tried out hike and bike trails, but nope, nothing'. oh, i met men all right, but the kind of guys i met made me want to swear off of them forever. yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. he's out there, my prince is going to come rescue me, i just have to have faith in real love. after some serious time had passed, i stepped out of my life and looked at what i had, and noticed that my many hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. so i just plum gave up. i was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. and that was it. so, i dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then i began to pray. it helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when i shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? my heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. how in the world can the words i choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the lord? he is the absolute perfect gentleman. i began to talk with him every day. i began to listen for his voice and i began to find him everywhere i went. i realized, i was never alone. i was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. the lord god in heaven loves me, and i love him. and you know what else, after i gave my heart to jesus, i met mark. would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 great danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as dixie bolted out my front door. we met, just that simply. he has arrived at my front door now, so i better go. we are on our way to jamaica oh how i love to be rescued!

"wow! time goes by fast. here i am doing my college homework and it seems as though just the other day i was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in college. time flies and friends come and go. i have met so many people since i have been at this enormous school. i have come to realize that you must take initiative in order to succeed. for instance, i am currently majoring in theatre, but i don't know if that's what i really want to do with my life. if i don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far i can go, i will never figure out if theatre is the way i want to go or not. then there's the question of what i'd do if i didn't major in theatre. i know that i wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time i've had to write this since i have had many computer troubles. i accidently erased the first one and my friend's computer froze when i was writing the other one. i am using my friend robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. right now i'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ut, and they're talking about ross's hair. some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he doesn't want his hair cut. they think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs to differ. anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. i just remembered that i have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my room. i hope it's not stale. maybe i can drink it with my over-do milk. it's past the drinking date. this gum is very stale and i am getting hungry. if i were in my room, i would eat my muffin or the chips that i didn't eat last week because i had to get to class. you see, i feed the birds my second sandwich because i'm full. then i still have chips left over. oh, well. the joys of wednesday sack lunches from towers. i'm used to sack lunches because i've eaten a sack lunch every day in high school. the reason is that we eat in the greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. some of my friends have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers get mad. ah, the good old days. robert and ross and kristi want to order a pizza. that sounds like a good idea. it's late and i have to get up early for my intro to media class tomorrow. college is a time when it seems hard to get any sleep. there's always something you've got to do, or just good old fashioned procrastination. i mean, i don't procrastinate. this isn't even due for another week or so, and here i am, already typing it for the 3rd time. adam sandler is on tv right now. i just learned that his cds have a parental advisory due to explicit content. isn't that interesting. funny how society tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these days. like my friends. they're crazy. children are exposed to so much, like from tv. i never had cable growing up, so i don't know what it's like. we did have channel 13, kera. that was nice. now, we're listening to the doors, which reminds of a midsummer night's dream because my high school did it in the 60's and that was the music we used. well, at least, we used some doors music. we used great 60s music. then i was in a midsummer night's dream in the 90s, and we used original music written by one of the cast members. he wrote the tune for the wiz, and tranfered the words because of course shakespeare didn't write like the music in the wiz. robert just called a guy because his number was on a dollar bill. he's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. then there's ross with his mushroom haircut and kelly, who some say looks like tom cruise, but in reality, he looks nothing like tom cruise. no more than the pizza guy, who looks like a clown. i am afraid of clowns and i haven't even seen ""it. "" however, i did see a stephen king movie on new years a couple years ago with 2 girls from scotland. new's years day was 32 hours for me because i was traveling back from israel. that was a great trip. well, it's been 20 minutes and i feel like there's not much else needed to say.

"i lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her i started to miss her. i had attempted to email her but she never responded, i guessed that she was mad at me. i have emailed her 6 times with no reply but i am a persistent bastard so finally today, in fact just before i opened this page i decided to check my email as i do every day and there was her email. it explained that she had not checked her email all summer, it may not be true but it works for me. i proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around 10 minutes. i will eagerly await her reply as i basically demanded to see her. we'll see if she accepts. i never checked to see when i started this but i will keep on writing until i run out of shit to say. i assume that cursing is not a problem, i understand that this is a class full of naive little freshmen but i think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities, don't worry i wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and i am an avid cusser so i hope this will do (that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing). now i am running out of things to say. i like most of my classes. my major is biochemistry. i am 20 years old. i have brown hair blue eyes, i like to play football watch football, opening day is sunday! i live for football actually, i like movies, i am filling in space. this is odd and i am going to stop now. thank you kent ",1,-0.601407 1.009216 -0.605586 1.184071 0.591156 -4.031029 0.646505 -0.237315 0.130096 -1.404576 -0.104542 -0.590446 1.610269 0.580486 1.513589 0.0 -0.04277 1.305992 0.808958 0.275524 0.92771 -0.222098 1.429478 2.150162 0.582275 -1.532795 0.672317 -0.190141 -0.468801 -0.720061 -1.100231 0.110436 0.120188 0.027393 0.885934 0.57669 -0.203325 -1.416654 -0.170002 0.296842 0.237399 -0.821104 0.681116 1.296239 2.89736 0.837525 -1.093488 1.223924 4.453548 1.195803 -1.34699 1.740932 0.417685 0.269812 0.680047 -0.621556 -0.91363 -0.954251 -0.853883 0.957867 0.014469 -0.923267 -0.480161 0.173348 1.280404 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.641637 0.09249 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.048362 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.275313 1.593635 0.195431 -0.903334 4.751313 3.565262 3.889937 4.979377 4.816557,565
"ok, so i don't understand how people can get into relationships that are so suffocating. my friend was just telling me how his girlfriend was mad at just because he didn't call her right at 12am. he also told me that he couldn't tell his girlfriend that he was out with me at heb because then that would make her jealous. what kind of relationship is that when there is no trust, even though they say they love each other. blah, blah, blah. they've been going out for less than 3 months and they are talking about love and marriage. i can't imagine falling in love so quickly. maybe that is because i've never been in that situation before. my friends always ask why i don't date. i've been trying to figure out that myself. i usually use the ""copout"" answer that i don't have the time which is indeed true. i also think that i don't date because i haven't found the person who i click with. there are some friends i feel totally comfortable around, but they are too good of friends and that would be way too awkward. supposedly, as others say, i could get any guy i want, but i totally doubt that. i guess i just have a low selfesteem, but i don't know. that's kind of an extreme statement to make. i think also i've been so independent all my life because of mommy and daddy always being at the restaurant that i basically raised myself. there could have been so many opportunities for me to turn bad, but i didn't. yet, things my parents never think anything is good enough. i feel like they always see the bad in me. if i do something good, they praise that, but automatically follow with a negative quality about me. how do you think that makes me feel? what's the point of trying if nothing if ever good enough. i always do things to please others. i am doing pharmacy because my parents want me to and i don't want to disappoint them because i see how hard they work and what they have gone through with my brother. i sometimes get so depressed when i realize that they are putting all their hopes on me and they make me feel guilty when i don't do what they want me to do. sometimes i feel it is too much pressure on me and i just want to cry and give up everything. don't they understand that that is too much pressure for me and that i might crack one day and go crazy. sometimes i always ask why me and why my family. like why are we going through these tough financial situations when we are such good people. but then i realize how lucky we are. we have a home, food, and all the people in my immediate family are healthy and living. i hear horror stories of what other people have to suffer through and i make it a point to not take anything for granted because everything could completely change in a blink of an eye. i also ask why are all the girls so much prettier than me and why i'm not as smart as others. then i hear kids that are born with mental retardation and makes me realize how lucky i am to be healthy and normal. it so hard sometimes to see of all the good things you have when you envy what others have. that's a serious problem i have. i should just be content with what i have and not worry about what others have. i like to be nice to others but when i see my friends giving more attention and things to my other friend who is always mean and whiney, what's the use of being nice and submissive. why do all the good ""guys"" lose? i guess that is just how the world works and that is so pathetic. i guess that is how human nature is. i went to the ut dance clinic tonight and i wish i was good enough to make it. i just don't pick up combinations up as quickly as the other girls. i wish i could because i really want to make it. i love to dance. i wish i could do that for the rest of my life but i am not good enough to make it my profession. it is so relaxing and i truly love doing it. i don't think pharmacy is what i want to do for the rest of my life. it seems to boring. but i have absolutely no idea what i want to do. i guess i haven't found my niche in the world. i wish i just knew what i wanted to do and go with it. why do i change my mind so often? life would be so much easier if i could just figure out what exactly i wanted to do with my life. i just hope my future is all i hope it to be. happy, prosperous, healthy, and with someone i truly love.

"you know i always wonder if i'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. i had opportunities to go to other universities but i chose to stay close to home. my parents always want it there way! they basically chose my major for me and when i wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. i want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and i know i'm going to stress over it, why should i bother to listen and i went with what i felt was best for me and i made the change. i always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. i see people trying so hard to make that a in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. one thing which confuses me is how girls think. they're like in their own world sometimes. you try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest idiot! i wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. they should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. why do the astros suck so bad this year? they had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. they were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. they're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the astros. i mean if you had bagwell, biggio, alou, caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? the rockets need to do better next year also. i can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. they could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. if they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. i don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. it would be so much easier to study the material but no, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. one thing i really love in the university are the girls. they are so damn hot! only if i could have one of them would i show them what kind of man i really am! its ok, one day, i will find the right one.

"what a waste of time. these guys are so hung on the fact that they can't decide whether they want to be this one or that one or if they can hack it. how stupid. it is really loud in the other room and i hate when people have their deadlocks one and leave the door open so it always slams when it closes. what should i do about mike? it is a really confusing situation. i wish that gabe would ask me out again. smoking is bad. justin just asked king dobie if he wanted to go smoke and it's gross. to relieve stress about all this frat shit. racism is bad. i don't understand why can't people just respect the fact that everyone is not going to be the same color as them. i am open-minded about it because i lived over seas and sometimes i wish that people would be able to have this experience so that they could understand a little bit about another culture. you learn a lot about your lifestyle and your own country when you are not surrounded about it the whole time. but right now i don't feel surrounded. ronnie is still probably crying over his ex-girlfriend and i feel his pain i have been through that before with chris, i wish here was here a lot of the time but i guess he isn't. he is probably with carley having sex which sucks for me to be thinking about because i think she is a really bad influence on him. i just hope he takes care of himself and doesn't screw up too bad at a&m since he already screwed up by even going there. imagine that . to be an aggie that would suck but i guess in a sense i am being prejudice against the aggies. they are a whole different culture but i hate to be called a hypocrite. someone called me today and it was my best friend in the whole world. cole is the man. i miss him so much and a lot of the time i wish that i has a friend as close to me here as he was to me. he is at westpoint and i feel bad for him, no sleep and lots of pressure to do well. i hope he is ok. i miss him and he needs my prayers, which i need to do. i got to get back into the swing of things,. i would be letting cole down if he knew where i am at with god right now, he is my accountability partner and i feel as though i am letting him down by not studying the word. i will probably go to metro on tuesday though and hopefully i will take someone with me. maybe brian will go. i hope so, i wonder how sarah and wade are. i miss seeing here and was pretty mean sometimes. brad on the other hand seems very worried about his job and i scared for him! we clicked really well at work and i wish we could spend some quality time together sometime but i don't know what he has been up to ? i got to go to bed soon. i was very stupid about waiting till the last minute to do homework but i do it all the time and i don't know why i surprise myself every time that i wait until the last minute to do stuff. speaking of which i need a job. where the heck am i going to get a job. i need money to pay for crap that i don't need, like sweats and shoes that i would add to the collection of almost 40. lauren just walked in the door and i knew because i recognized her voice. she is weird but in a great way. only 4 minutes i think. it seems like twenty minutes is such a short time when you are babbling your thoughts to a computer. mike is weird and he has this annoying laugh that drives me nuts. so does gabe but gabe's is cute, or am i just trying to justify it because i think i like him. probably i do that a lot. i can convince myself that something is good when it isn't and the exact opposite. it sucks. i never know whether to believe myself or not to. just like when i talk about sex, i don't want to have sex until i am married and i have made a commitment to not only myself and god but to my future mate. wow that is scary. thinking about marriage. "" just what every girl dreams of. their wedding day. "" but i hate to be out in the category 'every girl' i am my own person and i feel like i am unique.

"you know, being in a relationship is great. and i absolutely love college. but i have discovered that it is really hard to put the two of them together. i mean, jason and i have been together for about 8 ' monthssmall on the grand scale of things, i know, but it seems like an eternity. in fact, i find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before jason. he is, after all, my first real serious relationship. and i don't know. i mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn hard to keep what we have in college. i love him. i mean really love him. he says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. i think that if you're in love, then you know. so that means that he probably doesn't love me. we're lopsided. so that kind of sucks, but i deal with it, you know? i mean, sometimes it gets me down because when i say, ""i love you"" i don't hear one back. so, i get depressed. but he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and i guess that's enough to suffice. maybe sometimes i feel like i just have enough love for the two of us, but other times i become really doubting. maybe i don't love him either. i mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? how do we know that love even really exists? how do we know? i mean, yeah, there are songs, books, and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity. but how do i know that it's not just a really big ""like. ""? i mean, maybe that's all i have for jasona really big like. that makes me think. because, if it is just a really big like, then where did all of this ""love"" stuff come from? do i say that i love him because it's my first real relationship and i just don't really know any better? am i really just enamored with him because he was my first? is the fact that i'm questioning it at all mean that it isn't real love? don't they say that if you have to question love, then it isn't really love? i mean, i know that i would do anything for this boy. and i mean anything. i know that i wake up in the morning and i can't wait to be with him, to see him, to touch him, to smell him, to make him smile, to make him laugh, to hear his voice. i know that when i'm not with him, i am wondering where he is or what he's doing or wondering if he's wondering about me. but, it's like deep down, i know that he's not. he doesn't feel about me the way that i feel about him. and because he says that he likes me a lot, and he's not sure if it's love or not. since i like him more, that makes me think that what i feel must be love because it's on a higher level than that of which he feels. logical, right? i didn't think so either. i guess i'm just confused. most guys aren't as confusing as jason. actually, for the most part, he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy. but he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him. i mean, i'm always wondering ""ok, he says he's fine. but does that mean that he's really ok, or does that mean that he's still upset but doesn't want to tell me?"" i mean i secondguess myself all of the time with him. i have a really low selfesteem when i'm around guys. i'm tall, so i always think that guys don't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter, cuter girl. i mean, jason is in a frat and he doesn't want me to go to parties with him. that really hurts my feelings. i feel like it's because of a lot of reasons, but the main one being that i'm not pretty enough for him to ""show me"" to his brothers or whatever. also, because he wants to not be attached to anyone at a party so that he can hook up with other girls for one night standssomething that he tells me he's done before. that really bothers me. he tells me that he's cheated on all of his girlfriends beforeso how do i know that he's not going to cheat on me, too? what assurances do i have???? how can i trust him? especially when i know that he's done it before? how do i know he won't do it again? monica tells me ""once a cheater, always a cheater. "" is she right? should i not trust him? do i have a choice?

"right now i am watching tv. i it kinda hard to type with these nails, i don't think i have had to type a large amount since i got them. the commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. i need to get my nails filled, but i don't think i am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that i can spend my money on. i would be nice if i had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. i just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because i had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. i is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. everything seems so materialistic, but i must admit that i am just as materialistic as anybody else. where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. got that book for my sister. that is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. that must be so hard. it seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. i guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. maybe that is how she and her late husband met. mom's birthday is on friday. i need to get a card for her, and i need to get a card for luis. i can't forget that when i go to the store tonight. hopefully that won't take up too much time, because i have a lot of reading i need to do and write notes over what i read. it is frustrating, because i am always reading and doing homework, yet i constantly seem behind. i guess i have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. that sucks though, because then i will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. it is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. i wish i could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. i hope that someone from health south will call me back, if not i will call again since i just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. i would really like to start working again, especially because i need more hours. well technically i have enough to apply for pt school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. some of then have been there for three years. luis and eli had been there for a year and a half or something like that. well eli isn't working there, because he is starting pt school. i wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in san antonio. i don't think waking up at 6:30 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that i am in school, but i guess i just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. i don't really like not having a job, i like the security of know i have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. of course, i think school would be less stressful without a job, but i know i could handle it if i had one. okay i am at somewhere around 15 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since i typed that. man i haven't been typing too fast, i guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. i should put the stuff i need from the store on a post it. i think i have some stuff written somewhere, i usually have random post its with reminders. i know i have one for the stuff i need to get at home this weekend, but i'm not sure about the store. i'll look after i am done with this. okay what next. i wish i could type as fast what i can think. i forget half of what i am thinking by the time i write down the first thought. one minute left. i wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. maybe i should go to the doctor sometime. it could be what i eat, maybe i am allergic to something, or just not eating right. time's up, i guess this is it.

"i hate it when you get so confused and you don't know what to think about anything. sometimes you think you are making the right decision but then you start to doubt yourself. i guess i tend to do that a lot lately. i never know if what i am doing is right or not. will it work in the long run? oh well. school gets to be confusing but i guess that is at least something that is relatively constant. i don't think i deal that well with change. but i am not so sure anyone really does. things tend to be uncertain a lot more that a lot of people like to admit. the only thing that i know for sure is that no one person stays the same no matter how much they would like things to. personally, i have always thought that it is possible to care or even love more than one person at the same time. i am not sure why or when monogamous relationships came around but i am not exactly sure they work. i actually have a lot of proof, just look at the divorce rate. but i guess that is not really proof of anything except for the fact that people have given up forgiving other people for their mistakes. everything changes schools, and people and everything else. when you see people that you have known a long time in a different setting, why does everything seem so weird. some of them seem nicer others have changed so much that you can't even recognize who they are. anyway, i am really tired of thinking about this. computers can really get so annoying. i realize that they are supposed to be a good thing but they can be really confusing too. i guess everything really is. i am getting really tired of talking to myself or at least that is how i feel i wonder what draws certain people to certain things. like what makes me like the color pink and someone else absolutely detest it? my next question is why do i put things off? i guess because i don't like to admit to myself that i actually have work to do. plus i guess i am just plain lazy. there's nothing like having a few really close friends but then that can be a bad thing too. but another problem is when you have a group of friends, and of course if there are guys and girls in the group as there normally one of them becomes attracted to another and of course that can become a huge problem. the worst thing is that if something does happen between those people then it will eventually seriously affect the rest of the group. la la la!!! i feel so retarded right now and my time is up. so i guess this is goodbye. at least until i do my next righting assignment.

"what am i thinking? that is quesiton i sometimes ask myself when i'm things that are out of this world. thinking, to put the mind to work and have conversations in your head about whatever is on your mind at that moment or to ponder over a serious of questions or question such as this one. right, now i'm thinking of what to write, and as always not being able to think of anything worth writing. its not my thing to write out of the blue without having prethought what i was going to write. i'm sitting in front of my computer, cold and tired from a very long day. my dorm room is always to cold so i have to sit here shivering while i type. the cold may be affecting my train of thought since i'm preoccupied in thinking how i'm going to keep warm after this is over. i should have put on a sweater but for some reason i let myself remain cold and keep complaining about it. it's my fault really,i should just get up and put on a sweater or wrap a blaket around me. what stops me from doing it, i don't know. it could be because i have to stay here for twenty minutes typing or because i'm to lazy to actually get up and search for something warmer, or it could be because it won't be long after i put in on that i will have to take it off to go to sleep. i never found it comfortable to sleep with a sweater on, except of course in the extreme cases like when i used to go camping out in the mountains in the middle of january. i like camping, its the one thing that i love to hate and vice versa. during the day it nice to going hiking and stuff but during the night it can be horrible having to take a bath in the freezing cold and make dinner by fire and lamplight, not to mention the cold hard ground and the paper thin tents that are suppose to protect us from the 30 degree weather. i'm don't really like the cold but then again when its a hundred degrees outside i wish winter would come. people in general are never content with the weather. its either to hot or to cold,like food almost. we blow on soup to cool it down and hold ice cream in our mouths till it melts before swallowing it. my radio is on and so is the tv which has nothing to do with anything but we are suppose to write continuously for twenty minutes, so i thought i'd write that. its relaxing to be listenting to the radio, cause even when i'm down there's alway a song to cheer me up. right now i'm relaxed happy to be ahead in my reading but aware of a test i will have to take this friday. people always have the ablity to walk in at the wrong times. someone just knocked on the door and i shouted to them to come in and in seeing me at work they left but they did disrupt me which of course is always inviting except when i have to do something where i can't be interrupted like this timed writing. in 30 seconds, never mind i'm done.

"i want to see my friends and my parents. can i go home? i lied to my parents. they don't like me too much right now. maybe even hate. i feel sorry. disgusted. hate for myself. i shouldn't have done that. but i'm an adult. ,i should do whatever i feel and they should just except it. turn that music off. my roommate listens to some weird stuff. what is that? it's depressing. i don't like it. it makes me homesick. why? it doesn't even remind me of home. gee, i want to listen to some rap but i'm sitting here writing continuously. is that how you spell it. it's hard to type what you think when you think it. even though they said not worry about grammar and all, i'm still worried. what if the professor thinks i'm stupid because i can't type. what if i am stupid because i can't type. thank got for backspace. anyhow, what is this for. why am i typing this. i need to do it. it's homework. i need to do homework. i feel bad. confused. wrong. should i take notes while i read in my textbooks. i don't know. i feel like an outcast when i don't take notes in my classes. should i? should i be writing down everything the professor says. should i? i'll find out when we take our first test. then when i fail, i can say now i know what to do when the problem could have been solved in the beginning by the teacher saying, please take notes because everything on the test will be from lecture. you bought the book because the university needs another way to spend money they know you don't have. ha! that was funny. okay, where was i. thinking still. i'm hungry. i can't stand the food at jester but i eat it like i've never had food before. it's just there and it tells me eat me fat boy you paid for it so eat it. i try to tell myself to find something descent like the gourmet pizza, not, or the soybean burgers but i keep getting in line to have that crappy stuff ion the choices line. never anything worth getting but i still eat it. why? i miss home cooking, not that my mother ever cooks but mcdonalds serves as a home cooked meal for me since that is what we had for dinner a lot when i was growing up. mcdonalds is good. i like the nuggets? barbecue sauce is the bomb. one time i went to mcdonalds and they wouldn't give me any barbecue sauce. bastards. anyway, what was i talking about. so, i miss my home. i miss my friends. i called each of them the first week i was here. they all stayed at home to go to college there, or joined the military, or just didn't go to college. oh well, their loss because it's fun up here. actually, it's fun in san antonio where i live. i would probably not be going through anything like i am here if i were to stay home. i needed this in my life, to experience new things and new people. funny though, there aren't that many mexicans here at ut. i mean there are tons of asians, blacks, indians, and of course white people but there aren't that many mexicans so i guess there are people other than mexicans in the world because in san antonio that's all you saw. mexicans. man my friend jason is so cool. i miss my friends from work. i used to work at cici's pizza, the best pizza value anywhere buffet for only 2. 99 you come and see us. , i always plug the restaurant to whomever i speak or whatever, anyway i don't know why because the food really sucked. yeah, it was bad. really bad. rats and roaches. that's all that comes to mind when i think of cici's. yeah, and pastries. everyone that worked there threw parties. they were the bomb. i went to so many when i worked there. anything and everything went at a cici's crew party although others were invited too. they were fun. i miss people at work. i remember dating this grill i worked with never date anyone you work with. people talk and shit happens and it really sucks. frustration. anger. anyway, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend now. she makes me cringe. probably because of the shit she put me through but mostly because every time she left me a message she would play a song from the radio. i guess that's why it's hard to listen to the radio and not think of her. disgust. , hate. pity. sadness. mistrust. bitch. i thought she was the one. ' no i didn't i just say that to sound normal. she really didn't mean a lot to me only that she loved me so i felt bad that i didn't love her so i told her i really cared for her but i didn't. i lie to everyone i guess. even myself. sadness. silence. hurt. i don't know what else to write. nothing comes to mind only blackness. i hit a chord as i wrote that. is it true. i hope not. i never mean to be dishonest. i only tell the truth to hurt people and that's wrong. not always but i just feel funny when someone feels a certain way and i don't feel that way back. you know? anyway, that's all i'm going to say about that. is there any gum around here? found some it's good. juicy fruit. is going to move you it gets right to you, the taste the taste the taste is going to move you. okay, commercial. anyway, i wish i had a tv right now. i miss cable . i love to watch comic view and bet and mtv and comedy shows. tonight is seinfeld. that show is hilarious although the series finale sucked. very disappointing. i was mad. upset. i had to tape it because i had a band concert that night. band. bad memories. some good. i wish i played better so i could do something with it but i never practiced on my instrument. i never applied myself. another hidden talent gone to waste. what about college. apply myself? hopefully and succeed. want to graduate but not too sure on them probability of it. hope so. want to please myself as well as my friends and family. don't want to let myself down but i don't know if i want it that bad. sniffle. sadness. i want to make my parents proud again before they leave this earth. death. blackness. crying. .

"hmmm, i am eating a chupa chup lollipop right now. it is really good. i don't know what to write because i am trying to just think and when i do that i think about thinking and well, i'm not exactly making sense, but it doesn't work. i am tired. look at that phone book. wow. my roomate is blow drying her hair. there is a meeting tonight and she is running for something. i don't know what. historian, i think. my mom was so mean to me last night. i try to tell her things about my life and she says she doesn't want to know. she does, she's just afraid of what i'll tell her. i'm a good person. i haven't done anything bad. she just doesn't want to know that i have a boyfriend. but, i think she does. she probably doesn't like the guy because he's mexican. that's stupid. how can a person limit thier options of people to love to just those in their race? if i didn't think being gay was disgusting, i would say it made sense. why limit your options to people of the opposite sex? that's silly. but, i'm not attracted to women, so i don't leave women as opption though. sometimes i think i don't want to get married. there are so many people getting divorces. i don't want to get divorced. i wish i were a man. they have it so much better. they don't get a period. they don't have to go through labor. now labor is something that is very special and in a way i think it's very cool that i can experience it, but when i took a child development class in high school it really scared me. i don't think i'd make a very good mother anyway. at least, i'm afriad i wouldn't. but back to why i wish i were a man. men can pee while standing. not fair. and they don't even have to take their pants down. again, not fair. men get wrinkles, they are distinguished. women get wrinkles, they are old. men get in a fight, they are just releasing that testosterone. boys will be boys. women get in a fight. bitches. men sleep around and they are considered studs. women sleep around and they are called sluts. not fair. of course, no one ever told me life would be fair. men and women are not created equal. i don't really want to be a man. i'm accustomed to being a woman. well, i'm not a woman. i'm still a girl. i don't want to grow up, i'm a toys r us kid. there's a million toys at toys r us that i can play with. from bikes to games to video games, it's the biggest toy store there is! i don't want to grow up cause baby if i did, i couldn't be a toys r us kid! i really don't want to grow up yet. my my observations, adults generally have very little fun. adults are always stressed out. i find myself stressing and getting very tense about things. i must be careful about that. i think it's important to stay young at heart. there are times to in which people must be serious, and that's important, but it's also important that people know when to let go and smile. i love college. i thought i would be so homesick when i came here, but i'm not at all. i love it here. i feel so comfortable here and i don't want to go home. i love my parents and the rest of my family, and i guess i miss them sort of, but i'm not homesick. i love austin. i want to stay here forever. well, not forever. i want to get out of this country. i want to go everywhere. i would go anywhere i had the oppportunity to go. i don't care where. i want to go everywhere and learn everything. i hope i never lose that feeling. i hope when i am an old woman that i will still be hungry for knowledge. i know that i will never be able to learn everything there is to learn, but i'm going to give it my best shot. it's funny, i look out my window and the sky is so beautiful, but there are all these buildings that are contradictory to the beauty of the sky and nature. if i do live in a big city like austin, i hope i will be able to go somewhere like colorado, where i can get back to nature. i think that's important. i don't think i want to live in a big town though, if i have children. i want to raise children in a small town. not my home town though. the people there are extremely narrow minded and they think the would revolves around that little town. no culture. i wonder where i will live when i am older.

" i'm sitting at the pcl library, i can hear the computers humming, i'm typing kind of fast so i'm worried that people will find this annoying, because i sometimes do and sometimes when i click the mouse too fast some people get annoyed. my feet are really hurting from the bruises i think i got from the car accident on wednesday, i'm wondering if i should go to the university health center and talk to someone about it, but i don't know if i'll have time to go up there, and maybe there's nothing to worry about and bruises will fade by themselves anyway. now i'm thinking about the calculus quiz that i did yesterday, i did really bad on it. i ran out of things to say, i'm really sleepy. my uncle left today i feel bad that i didn't say goodbye but he left so early in the morning back to lebanon, i don't know how long it will be until i see him again but he wasn't as friendly as he was a year ago. i remembered last night that it was my 2 friend's birthdays, it was my brother's too and i didn't get him anything. . i really should have, i should go today, but i'm so concerned about how much money i've been spending lately, i don't work anymore and i'm running out of money i should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 95. 5, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now.

"tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. i've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as i've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.

because i really don't maybe i will later but it has been a week. weird sometimes i don't feel that m, no things don't make me feel anything, i chose to react to them like that (says mom the rogerian counselor) why am i taking psychology again i already took the ib test and i did pretty well only you don't know what that is i bet yeah ib is bad down with ib oh well liberal arts education will help you know i need to get my confidence back up, i'm smart i've had a great education, better than most ok i know i'm just practical so there typing is nice and fast my handwriting is not too marvelous ha ha that sounds like something out of catcher and the rye or something i love holden so true yet so extreme. i need to read more i need to be more well read typing typing typing i didn't do this in word uhh maybe i should ask you if it's ok not to do it in word, don't answer that i want to live dangerously interesting huh you think instructions to a vacuum cleaner is interesting reading?

"okay here it goes. i am freezing in this computer lab doing this project that no one will ever read but, hey, i don't want to be negative. let's start with something else. i want to start over already. i do that every time. just like when i am about to serve a volleyball, i always get stuck for some reason and have to start over. it is like i don't trust what i am about to do. all i can really think of right now is how the professor, i don't even know his name, was talking about thinking about my dog. oh yea, pennebaker. i am not really thinking anything at all now. this really makes this assignment difficult. i know that i'm not spelling any of these words right. my hands are so tired, i'm sure why. this reminds me of when i was a little girl, and i would lay in bed at night and try to see if i could think nothing. but i would always seem to be thinking two thoughts at a time. i would be thinking i'm thinking nothing, i'm thinking nothing"" and at the same time, i would be singing a song in my head or something. i don't see how this project can work really. it seems like i have so many thoughts per second, that by the time i write down one thought, so many are missed that you don't get and accurate stream of consciousness. some bell just went off. i thought it might a fire alarm but it's not. i don't think it would matter if it was, no one seemed to care. i always think about thoughts people have while they are one stage. and dreams. my friend amber, her mom owns this weird new age shop where they have a lot of drean stuff. there is this woman that will tell you your future. just like when i was working in new york, john, my boss, went to a psychic and i always think about this woman who's eyes are green like she is possessed or something. i thought john was really dumb to go to those things. he also did cocaine, man he was really messed up. i wish i would not have stayed at that job as long as i did. i wonder why there are some people like john, then there are some people that have a head on their shoulders. i guess i'm going to being learning about that in psychology. i hope my little brother makes it into this school next year, mom and dad say that his grades aren't good enough. that sort of breaks my heart. i wonder how in the world i can really write down my thoughts when half the time, i don't even know what i'm thinking. it seems like the thoughts overlap some times. i can't wait till the results of the audition go up today. this assignment is funny, i bet a bunch of people come in here and write on this thing like it's a diary or something then someone out there reads it and tired man i'm tired 5 o'clock this morning i am just pushing buttons helping some guy out there make an experiment i am not even looking at the screen haven't been this whole time really i like pressing the space bar this makes me so self conscience because i am having the stupidest thoughts my eyelids are closing i don't want to go to lunch with that girl today she is so young my head id getting heavy this is funny like a dramatic comedy i guess i think in theatre terms a lot, huh i also think about my dad right now when i was growing up i can't remember when i started this thing but i think in a few minutes i will be done red headband cold on my arms nothing to do until noon sound of the computer next to me typing of the keys this chair hurts my back every time i push it up it falls down i brought an extra pad today oh, if that guy reads this i hope he don't get grossed out by that part. i love finding out about god. that sky was so beautiful sun big whole when i get sleepy, no one can understand me. big guy to my left sound again cut thoughts i just erased something i wrote down i ruined the experiment sounds off flipping pages that's it twenty ",1,-0.59667 0.681808 0.90567 1.005934 0.817349 0.184503 0.0025 -0.34457 -0.206808 0.424376 -0.074916 -0.590446 -0.335602 0.260658 -0.282409 0.0 -0.04277 -0.071428 0.159708 -0.795527 -0.045725 -0.143128 -0.525438 1.004926 0.302235 -0.518508 -0.651805 0.036284 -1.431632 -1.175183 -0.494343 -0.247372 -0.78683 -0.547661 -0.530653 -0.462016 0.710179 -0.232637 2.114385 -0.362273 -0.548785 1.330583 -0.588914 -0.474859 0.785423 -0.171925 -1.093488 -0.730136 -1.261921 -0.850651 1.47271 1.224841 0.094247 0.172741 -0.055364 0.973305 -0.032987 2.331832 0.193951 0.163489 -0.439232 -0.820529 -0.092618 -0.392544 -0.196069 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.644755 0.189339 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.121836 -0.064119 -0.451544 0.751083 -0.480317 4.575891 4.086435 4.591366 4.775635 4.323905,74

"my love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as i sit here and write this assignment. i don't understand any software but everything for ibm, and the macintosh is completely foreign to me. i must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey i am new to this whole apple thing. apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. every time i type the word a lot, i am reminded of my english teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. i'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that i should have written it as two. i think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. i see a lot of people around campus just like that although i remember their faces and words, for the life of me i cannot remember their names, and i would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, azi, do you remember me?? more than likely i would not, or i would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. i do that a lot. people will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before i responded by just looking up. my thoughts consume me sometimes. i have a problem with daydreaming. i know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. it is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. i was talking about my thoughts, and how i daydream. well, lately all i can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man i am to marry. it seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. i have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. i went to a summer church retreat, and i think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because i met guys for the first time that i could honestly see myself marrying. this has never happened before, and as i glance around the campus, i just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and i am here longing for there company. it is not like i need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. i miss them a whole lot because i have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that i met at this church retreat in california. i think i forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout cali, and i have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless i actively seek a job to where i can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful golden state of california. all of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and i miss them terribly. i have to go back some day, i haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as i had in california. i know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little bit of why i would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason i would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a baptist church, or a jewish synagogue embodies. that spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. it would be ideal if i could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and i stress this because that is a big part of my life, but i am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. it's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, i am not asking for the ken and barbie playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, i just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. i just don't think that i can have that right now, and that is why i spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. the challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. and if i may i would like to end with a statement that linda ellerbee made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes.

"the thoughts that are running through my mind at the moment deal with my studies. i am trying to do as much studying this week before the weekend when all my friends from houston are comming in. i'm having trouble accomplishing this because i haven't managed my time to have enough time to study. i'll go to the library for about 2 hours and feel like i haven't learned anything. aside from school, everything is going well. i have a boyfriend back in houston and we are working the ""long distance relationship"" good. he is visiting me this weekend and so far we have seen one another every weekend. i have been with him for almost two years and ever since i have come to college, i am worried it will not work out. he is 21 years old and doesn't have a successful future as of right now. he is attending a junior college, but he isn't doing much there and he doesn't set goals for himself. i am starting to realize the importance of school and my future. i don't want to waste years of my life with someone that can't provide a future for me. i went potluck this year at my dorm. we get along great. the only flaws i can see as of right now is that she is on the phone all the time and that she sleeps really early. it bothers me that everytime someone calls for mr she tells them shes on the other line and to call back. i cannot do anything past 10:30 in the room for i feel i am interupting her sleep. this is difficult for me because i'm so used to sleeping late and doing little things like playing on the computer or watching television before going to bed. today i only had one class which was economics. i don't think i did very well on our quiz today and i think it will be my hardest class this semester. i am currently in the college of liberal arts as undeclared and i am scared of not being able to get into the business school. i am positive that i want an office job. i am lookin into commuinications as a back up of business. it bothers me how people got into business school just because they were in the top 10% of their senior class, because i went to a ver competitive school with many smart students as where many of the students went to small schools or schools that i know i couldv'e been top ten in. i was happy to be in the top 15% in my school which took a lot of hard work. throughout high school i took an english class at a junior college and i just found out that the official transcript i had sent had no grade on it to tranfer for credit here at ut, so i had to call the college to send another one to ut. my dorm room just got painted and it still smells in here. the people in my wing are friendly. last night i went to an fsa meeting. here i met people the same race as i(filipino). this was interesting to see how many filipinos are on campus and a good way to meet people since i haven't really been associationg with people i've never met yet. i'm looking forward to play co-ed sports with this association and meeting other fsa members from dallas,u of h, and baylor. my older sister was part of this organization and she got a lot out of it. my sister has been an importmant part of my life. she is a motherly figure, but younger. she has been a great role model and is there for me whenever i need her. for the rest of the day i plan on going to the library and studying and going out later on tonight. i'm looking forward to this weekend. i also have to vacuum our room and do laundry. i went to church here in austin for the first time recently and it was very ackward. i have gone to church every sunday in the past with my family and it was weird being there by myself. i started to tear because all these memories of my family and the church arised in my mind. i've realized that recently i have been crying a lot. it's usually emotions built up in my mind of my boyfriend. he has been really nice and caring lately then he was when i was at home. i swam while i was in high school and was going to the gym at least 3 times a week. as i have been in college i have taken fewer trips to the gym. i have been lazy or too busy worrying about school. i have been gettin 5-6 hours of sleep lately. it's not that i stay up late, but its the fact that i am tired and can't fall asleep. i think it is probably caused by stress. i want to go home soon because i need to buy many things for my dorm. it's hard not having a car and being able to go wherever you want when you please. i am eating ramen noodles for the first time as a college student. i ate them at home about twice a week so i'm used to it. the food here at the dorm gets old. i get sick of the same things and same tastes everyday. i think i may be gaining weight. i really need to go running. our televison is finally working and i can watch my soap opera. i really miss my family, dog, and friends back home. in a way i wish i had stayed back.

"i really don't know what to say. i am just doing some assignment for the psychology class. it is an interesting class, yes, and i am happy to be in it. i am now looking at my pencil. this pencil has been with me for about a year and i still have not lost it. i usually loose these pens and pencils within 3 or 4 weeks. my roommate just picked up the phone and started talking to a friend of mine. it seems that texas just won the football game. i am happy to hear that. again i am thinking what am i going to write for this assignment. yes, i can type pretty fast but to write for 20 minutes, i really don't know what i will be saying?! i am a junior by hours at ut but i am actually a sophomore in electrical engineering. i work as a grader for ee316 class and i really like doing the job. only thing is, i hate failing students but what can i do? if i don't, they will fail the other chapters to come. my roommate is laughing right now and distracting my thoughts from this assignment! oh, well! i hope my friend who is studying in the library does not call me right now while i am doing this work. my friend and i are supposed to go and eat at dobie soon. i really hope he does not interrupt me. i am feeling hungry now and i am getting tired for typing for a long time even though only about 10 minutes have passed. i wish the food was better for me to eat at the cafeteria. unfortunately, the food is not great. my friend just called me but i am continuing writing. i told him to call me back in 15 minutes. hopefully, i will be finished with this assignment. i can hear the conversation between my roommate and one of my friends over the phone. they are talking about going to 6th street. i probably would like to go but i think i need to call my brother and sister today. anyway, that is life and i need to do all this work. i am really tired and now, my thoughts just don't flow anymore. i hear the bathroom toilet flush in the community bathroom. the room is suddenly cold and i wish i wasn't wearing shorts. oh well. now what. i wish work was just bla bla bla and a whole lot of rubbish. however, it is not that easy. i want to get this assignment done with. why wasn't it 10 minutes instead of 20 minutes? i wonder what the results of this experiment are going to be? what are they going to help with? i am really hungry and the only thing that is stopping me is this work. please finish, please finish. a door just slammed because someone closed it hard. i wonder why. anyway, i am tired now. i don't want to write a research report for psychology but i also don't want the experimentation in psychology to take a lot of time for me. i think i will stick with the experiments. i love being a grader in ee316. people look up to me but i have to remember to be humble to them because they are also human beings who are just as intelligent as me and they are all good people. i wish i could see my parents, my brother and sister right now. unfortunately, i can't since i am an international student. i wonder how my friends from high school are doing. i hope they are doing well. oh well, i have to go. is it time, yet? let me check. phone rings. greg called my roommate. a cool guy. i have to do something right now. it seems both my roommate and greg went to the same party yesterday and had good fun. come on finish up. yes it is done. thank you. my hands are really tired. bye and thank you ",0,-0.582803 0.776275 0.548595 0.275493 -0.105264 0.691338 0.376518 0.002821 0.662343 0.057071 -0.2211 0.694289 -0.614105 0.748785 0.238856 0.0 -0.04277 0.052786 0.961758 -0.795527 0.800501 -0.286469 -0.5878 -0.5915 0.961558 0.297202 -0.331907 -0.053875 -0.510446 0.182676 0.28264 0.595046 -0.925272 -0.906028 -0.461849 -0.001267 0.172457 -0.235193 -0.75349 0.318746 -0.479609 0.299756 -1.583643 0.654661 -0.481649 1.846589 -0.79328 0.475497 1.986825 -0.941911 -0.356891 0.197616 -0.603988 1.573816 0.176915 -1.545965 -0.533127 -0.954251 0.79161 -1.702097 -0.013268 0.772348 -0.480161 -0.342751 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.570261 -0.087788 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.020047 0.180553 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.887085 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.035223 4.577725 4.296505 4.469265 4.92705 3.859942,1238
"i just finished taking the prescreening survey and i could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive. i'm not even sure that i will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if i'm qualified. i don't feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests - the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser, i guess. i have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday, and i surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it. i feel alright talking to people, but somehow it's different typing my feelings onto a screen. this screen represents nothing to me right now, i don't know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this. somehow i'm still making sure that i am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar. anyway, the event that i found out about yesterday. involves losing a person that i knew in high school. i can't stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls, and now one of us isn't here. it's very clear in my mind that we weren't the best of friends, but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well. i personally haven't spoken or seen her since graduation, but i knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else. now that i think about it (and i can't stop thinking about it) she is one of the most brilliant people i have met in my life. she graduated 5th in our class, and spent this past summer at princeton for a research project; definitely someone who was going somewhere. i never thought that something like this could happen to one of ""us,"" the people that basically built the foundation for the person that i am today. i know we weren't the closest that friends could be, but my best friends are wrecks right now, and that affects me. it's a direct and indirect effect, not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing, but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me. i'm tangled and i'm not sure where this leaves me. i hate that i can't remember the last thing that we said to each other. nevertheless i was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world, and i was off in mine, both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world. it's not fair that her life wasn't complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do. it's not fair that they found her the way that they did; it's not fair that we don't know and we won't know for a long time. the truth of what happened. everything is so complex. i can't call anyone; i mean, i can call, but i don't know what i could say that would offer any comfort. it'd be different if i were there with our friends, must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands. nobody here at ut went to my high school, and i doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew. i feel alone, i feel helpless, but at the same time i feel like i'm connected to everyone else who knew her because, well, we're all probably feeling alone right now. college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves, become good individuals in this world. at the same time, in the time between our high school graduation and now, we've all become isolated from each other. it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious. all time in the world is precious now. things that i was worried about before i heard the news, any stress that i felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared. homework and little things seem trivial to me. in a way things seem simplified now: we either are. or we aren't. just being here doesn't seem right- but is it selfish to be so so glad that i am here? i wonder if i deserve it, or if i can earn my place here. then again, who knows if it's so bad on the other side. i see that i have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness. what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular, and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as i press ""finish,"" yet for them to linger in my mind still. any other day i would have felt that this assignment was worthless, but i'll admit it. feeling like a part of myself is being put out there-a huge or small risk, i'm not sure-makes me feel the slightest bit better. maybe ",1,-0.063775 -0.809899 -0.607275 -0.837685 -0.552646 -0.220819 1.206304 1.120127 1.165091 0.795468 -0.067949 -0.264396 -0.734071 0.124756 0.970858 0.0 -0.04277 0.479261 -0.656602 3.042404 0.126529 -0.742368 -0.021849 0.688784 1.022681 0.266488 -0.486508 -0.447077 0.018315 0.21871 -0.023097 0.147135 -0.315464 -0.268931 -0.368218 0.616833 0.787241 -0.622773 1.371527 -0.023139 0.703286 0.870994 0.559071 1.910159 -0.445109 0.488055 3.58322 1.098131 0.65185 1.269491 -0.19019 -0.153977 1.265538 -1.185875 -0.888074 0.160115 -0.471808 0.019404 0.64337 2.164678 -0.939467 0.247819 -0.480161 0.195218 -0.235043 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.719234 0.513934 0.037983 1.676698 -0.396495 -0.37208 0.319988 0.645931 0.643252 0.246414 -0.202576 0.069782 4.441874 3.868792 4.852364 4.761016 5.138916,2222
"hello, i am so stressed right now with school. i am swamped with things to do. i don't even know where to begin i have so much. i am trying to get everything done because i am going home this weekend i don't want a lot to do. this is the first time for me to be home since i have been in college. i am really excited. i cannot wait to get away from everything. i wish i could have one day where i didn't have to do anything. i want to workout but i don't even have the time to do that. i don't see how people have jobs or be in a sorority or fraternity in school. i barely get everything done and i am not in them. they do stuff together almost every single night. i can't think of anything else right now except about what i have to do. i cannot wait until the texas and a&m game, it is going to be so much fun. i also cannot wait to see my family. i think i am a little home sick. i think i keep pushing the submit button when i am writing i hope that's okay. i don't mean to do that, but my laptop is messed up or something. anyway, i have been so busy that i haven't had time to call my friends or family. i have friends that go to this school but i never see them and hardly hear from them. i am so glad that i got a ticket to the ou game because i am one of the very few who doesn't have to wait in line. this reminds me of an assignment we had to do in high school. it was called power writing and we would have to write for two minutes about a topic and whoever had the most words at the very end won a prize. i was always the winner. people in the class would try to beat me and they never could. i guess i am just a fast writer. i really hope that it is okay that i pushed the submit button. it was an accident. i just figured out why that was happening and i think i fixed it. just disregard the unfinished versions of this. i can't believe that i still have more than five minutes to keep typing. after this i still have so much to do tonight. i can't wait until this weekend so i can shopping and wash my car, but i still have to write a paper sometime during this break. also want to go out to eat while i am there. i haven't done that in a while. i accidentally pushed that button again i hope that it is okay. anyway i am so tired and i really want to take a nap. i haven't gotten much sleep lately although i got more than i ever did in high school. in high school i got less sleep and did more physical work than i do now. i think my time is already up.

"college is perhaps the most unstructed, yet the most structured enviornment i have yet to face. vague, vague, it's all vague, yet so remarkably specific. i can't help but thing about what i'm going to say next. i'm engaged in an activity, that's how i work. when i'm doing something, i try to do it with the most focus i can. to simply do it with no thought is, to me, a waste of mind. back to college, i'm still trying to convince myself that i had no choice. had i given myself the option, i would be a music major, but i didn't do what i had to do. i slacked off on my music, a thing i can never forgive myself for. sure, in that time, i managed to develop my other skills in school, but what a becauset. i played viola for seven years to major in chemistry. sure, some may say that just having played is enough, but for me, to not bring about one's work to full potential is not worth anything. i hope i go through with chemistry, then at least i can say i stuck with something. listening to music right now, i think that perhaps i could have achieved that; maybe i still can, but it seems to far right now. at least the food is good, and my roommate is a nice person. i guess college will just be a test of how much i want to make a good life for myself. it's my brother; i'm so glad to talk to him; i had to leave him in the middle of the hardest part of his life (middle school); he was really used to having me there, but it seems like he's adapting fine. i hated my middle school years. the kids we mean and the teachers we less than happy to help out a shy little guy like i was. thankfully, high school was much better. college seems like it will be full of wonderful interaction, but i wonder how much interaction i'll be able to stand. i'm the kind of person who likes other people, but who also sees them as a distraction most of the time. and they always seem to distract when you don't want them to and disappear when you want company. i'll never figure people out. well, this has been a lot of uncohesive thought, but i guess that's the whole point. adieu and farwell ",1,-0.968301 0.044495 0.159012 -0.142011 -0.062174 -0.134166 -0.554759 0.463642 -0.088272 -0.923671 -0.124005 -0.590446 0.373625 0.215213 -0.405767 0.0 -0.04277 0.184935 0.365692 -0.042288 0.374446 -0.010586 -0.212948 0.565145 0.224323 0.718411 0.368204 -0.620029 -0.135717 1.225961 1.674396 -0.34692 -1.517114 -0.24958 -0.571642 -1.109326 0.013084 -0.782291 -1.101105 0.452736 -1.038726 1.381448 0.252533 -0.917299 -0.922372 0.549735 -1.093488 0.362699 1.235731 -0.362694 1.036883 -0.890651 0.475908 -0.722651 0.643338 -0.610008 -1.272734 0.048977 -1.282069 0.625898 -0.56546 1.25599 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.341131 1.82342 -0.073676 5.016586 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.713663 0.986771 0.016146 0.838507 4.43018 3.481173 4.577156 4.686279 5.129925,586
i am at work right now but i don't start to work until about 30 more minutes i wonder if any one is going to if anyone is going to ask me what i am doing oh well there is this person that i think is real nice so i cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so i guess ill start to press enter when i cant see the words i am typing i feel like laughing i don't really know why well i do but it would be to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see i wish i could go home i just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. i still like the class though cant wait fort he day to be over. i is supposed to rain today i want it to but i don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard i cant type as quick as my mind thinks i'm not sure i like this computer either well i'm still skipping my thoughts on the next assignment i think i better write it down instead. ok the truth i did erase something from the beginning of this document. i'm at work for goodness sakes. why do i keep putting periods down i guess it is hard to write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok i've got to stop that oh well i didn't know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what i was doing i wish i had more time to write some more poems i will though i really want to perfect the one i wrote about the tanut this i going to look crazy when they print it out. i like this assignment though i never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn't have enough speed to get everything on the net on my computer i rally want to buy some more software for it but i don't know if i can afford it so this guy that i was telling you about is so fine i feel like i want to jump his bones i even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn't even sexual so i wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings i hope my ta gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy i have a boy friend thought it will be five years in november i don't believe it i love him though ok my mind has gone blank i cant think of anything i wish that when i write paper that the information i need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so i could write a complete 12 page paper in one day i guess i would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday i should have been writing my thoughts down i actually because aware became aware of what i was thinking it was kind of weird why to i keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow i bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment i wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if i did know. naked why i don't know so one to the next topic my the way i wasn't taking bout the winston cigarette ads you know i don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until i have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that i do i won't be doing it for the rest of my life though i do know that for sure actually i'm not sure i know what i want to do bye.

"i am an adult person who has a culture, good background and origins that i'm proud of. i am an educated person who have attended full time school since 6 years old. i've traveled a lot and know lot of things around me. i am a ambitous person and very confident of myself. however, i've been feeling down for the last couple of years, i am not sure anymore where i'm going and what i want to do with my life. i have the feeling of wasting my time and being worthless. i've been living here for 3 years which is long but it seems to me it was just couples of months ago. maybe because i have not seen any progress in what i have been doing. i feel like i'm waiting for something to happen. i used to be a very active person and very energetic, full of joy and ambitious. but i'm not sick, i'm still a healthy woman, well that's what the doctors say! sometimes, ithink the reason is i think too much of the future and i don't give time to the present and enjoe it. but then when i do so, i feel like i'm wasting my time and i'm not being serious! it's like vicious cercle!! in the other hand, sometimes i see myself of thinking bad things that i'm not supposed. i try to reject it and take it out of my mind but it doesn't go. those ideas are like thinking the death of someone i know and who is very close to me, or a bad luck to her, or his,. i really don't wish that but the idea comes to my mind often and always feel guilty of it but i have hard time taking it away.

"just got home in houston. it's a 2 and a half hour drive. thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. i pulled to the side and got out of the car. she got out too and i looked at my bumper just a few scratches. i let her go. i am in a hurry! i have a doctors appointment at 4pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 5pm. there goes my afternoon! this is been a busy week and a depressing one. i knew i was going to see jenn at the csa meeting but somehow i knew even though i didn't want to see her. i still ended up saying hi to her. what is wrong with me!?!?! i should have just skipped it. i should have also not forced rona to go into the csa meeting room. i think she got a little mad at me. i didn't really care. she said she saw henry and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. she is afraid that he would say something to shawn or eugene or those dumb losers. even though they were my high school friends, i still think shawn has changed. well people change. what can i say? i changed for the worst. does anyone change for the best???? sometimes i wish i would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. but i end up making the bad ones that i am regretting. oh well. my friend chris is messaging me again on i'm maybe it's time to go. mom is coughing i hope she is ok. she said she is sick because of the car accident. i wonder how bad it was. it was my fault. i shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to austin. you see another bad choice of mine. what can i say!?!?!. i am speechless really want to change radically. stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present???

"i just got back from aerobics. it was really hard and kicked my butt today. i learned how to box. i really wish i knew how to box. i could kick george forman's butt. george forman lives 5 minutes from my house in kingwood. i have seen his house before and it is really cool. mark lives around there. i wish i could punch mark's face in now. he is such a jerk. i hope he is happy without me. that was a profound statement. this assignment is so boring. why do we have to do this. i hope i don't fail out of college. my dad would kick my butt and make me go to kingwood college. that is not cool. i would absolutely kill myself if i had to go to kingwood college. jeremy went to kingwood college. now he goes to tech. haha. i wonder if i will ever see him again. maybe so. steve is so much better than he is. i wish steve would have asked me out a year ago instead of jeremy. i have so much work to do tonight and i'm so tired. plus i have to got o that mixer tomorrow night. but i hope i don't have to go to my eight o clock class tomorrow. eight o clock classes should be outlawed. no one should have to be awake that early. the food here really sucks. my mom's cooking is so much better than this stuff. it's like prison food. that was really gross in the move sleepers when kevin bacon's character made those boys eat their food off the prison floor. then he beat them up. that movie was really disturbing. i bet stuff like that goes on in all kinds of prisons. i 'm against the death penalty. ""why do we kill people to show other people that killing is wrong?"" that is my most favorite quote of all time. kevin bacon's character deserved to die though. kevin bacon is really good looking. every time i see him in a movie, i remember him dancing in footloose and i start to laugh. his character's name in that movie was ren. like ren and stimpy. i hat that show. it used to be really funny, but now it is just disgusting. these guys that eat in the kinsolving cafeteria are disgusting. none of the good-looking guys come by our dorm. we must be losers. why would they come by our dorm? we are the best looking girls in our dorm. everyone else is disgusting. except for jenn, katie, amanda and alison. i'm glad allison and i are becoming friends. it is really cool how her dad and my dad roomed together and now ali an d i will room together in our apartment next year. i think my dad wants me to room with her and katie in a apartment next year. maybe one other girl. i can't even think to next year. i will be 19 on friday. that seems so old. princess diana was 19 when she married prince charles, i think. that is so sad that she died. i've watched so many news stories on her lately. it makes me sad. i want to watch the funeral on saturday. i hope we get home from waco on time. i'm excited to go to waco. it will be so much fun and steve will make my birthday really nice. although he is trying too hard. that is a turnoff. but he is such a sweet guy that i could never do anything to hurt him. he has really low self-esteem. and he is quite inexperienced. he is so much better than any of the other guys i have dated--but i don't know if i like him. i like jerk guys i guess. really good-looking cocky guys. like mark. and jeremy. and linsey. i wonder why lindsey never liked me. i wish he would have. even though he is a player, i bet i could change him. yeah right. wishful thinking. he is the best looking guy i have ever dated. even though it was a short fling. it was worth it. he is so good-looking. why does steve put up with a jerk like him for a best friend? i have no clue. poor steve--i think he lives in lindsey's shadow most of the4 time. that really sucks. i'm glad i don't do that. i can't wait for the weekend--it will be awesome. and i also can't wait for the 20 minutes to be up so i can finish this stupid assignment. my hands are getting tired. i should add that to my list of aches and pains form my aerobics class. i hope kathryn doesn't come to that class on thursday. i don't think katie and i could stand it. well, my time is almost up and i need to do my other buttloads of homework tonight. later.

"" trying to think of the artist who sings this song. i can't seem to think of the artist's name, but i know it, it's like it's on the tip of my tongue. i know it, but can't say it. i hate that feeling. my mind is once again blank. i'm thinking about the mall. because today we went to the mall. i'm now thinking about the topic of this writing assignment, am i doing it correctly? hopefully. how long do i have to go now? just thinking about the meeting that our dorm is to have concerning with sex since the radio had said something dealing with sex. i'm now making myself think of things. so i'm thinking of when i'm going to go back home. i'm thinking about wanting to go shopping. i'm thinking about the allegations i've read in the daily texan on gap. about how the were alleged to using sportshops. i'm thinking that if the allegations are true, will i continue to shop there. i'm thinking about the m&m commercial, the latest one, since i thought i heard something similiar to that on the radio. i was thinking of something, but was unable to type it down, wasn't fast enough. thinking of the song that is now pllaying, tlc's ""unpretty.

" i am really tired. i got up this morning at 7:45 to go get tickets for the seniors in my fraternity, and i don't even know if i'll get to go. they're for the texas vs. ou game in october. i was up last night until 3:30 and i had to wake up at 7:45 this morning to go wait in line at the stadium. i have the song nashville blues by cory morrow in my head because last night, after walking rachel back to her room, i came in to find three half-naked, drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate. they were making him play nashville blues while they sung and taped the entire episode. they claimed to be filming towers gone wild, which was a take-off of girls gone wild, only filmed at towers. i have recently been seeing a cute girl, but i am sort-of afraid of commitment. twenty minutes seems to me like a long time to type. i've barely made it through six minutes, and i am pretty much ready to go to bed and stop doing this. this girl is really cute and sweet, but i just got over a really hard break-up, and i am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen. i think that it is funny that, although i'm supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness, my spelling and grammar are almost impeccable. i wonder if the person who reads this will agree. i probab;y made a typo on some really easy word, and therefore the grader will assume that i am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults. or maybe that's me talking. maybe i'm grading myself when i say something like that. nine minutes and forty three seconds. it's funny that by the time i had written nine minutes and forty three seconds, that time had passed. i am now very ready to stop this assignment. twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for, but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping. i wonder what tank is doing. i wonder if laurie is going to come over to see him. i don't like laurie very much. i think she's very annoying. she whines far too much. now i'm whining about her. i hope i'm not keeping my roommate up with my typing. this keyboard is pretty loud. i still have to write for another seven minutes. my neck itches. there, that's better. my composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since i mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar. tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought. he doesn't really respect people's space too much. but he's an overall pretty good guy. if i go to sleep in fifteen minutes, i can take a three and a half hour nap before i have to be at the house to build. i am not going to philosophy. i am too tired. i don't really think i'll be missing too much, because if i did go, i would fall asleep in there as well. my bed is much more comfortable than those tables in the law building. that is a really long walk. i takes thirty minutes. my back hurts. i need a shower. i need a cup of iced tea. i actually don't need either of those. i just want a shower and a cup of iced tea. and a nap. i'm a pretty funny guy, if i put my mind to it. right now, i'm not putting my mind to anything but sleep. english was boring today. just like every other day. i think i probably failed that reading quiz. i probably got a fifty. i read about fifty percent of the selection. my professor must be pretty good at making quizzes if they're that accurate. i never had that happen in high school. i'm just going to stop now. good night.

"as i sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, i feel as if i don't belong here, in this setting. i'm not usually the completely studious type so i'm just trying this library thing out. it's really deathly quiet and i'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me. i feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting. i hope people around me aren't annoyed by this ""tapping"" as i am. i'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least i'm next to the window. i picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored. people watching is fun. it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and i often wonder how different it is from my own. i haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since i've moved up here to austin and just now, i realize that i indeed do miss it. i think i'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on. next time, i should remember to bring a jacket; i feel like i'm turning into a humansicle. but i don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here. it's quite a walk. i really should learn how to use the bus system here. i'm used to having the comfort of my car. the comfort i've had for four years. i miss it. i went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started. it's not because i missed home or i was homesick or anything. i've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much. like this summer, my 5 weeks overseas, i don't think i even thought about my family or home-life all that much. as horrible as that sounds, i'm not the type to miss my family or anything. anyway, i just went home this weekend because i felt that my dorm room was too bland and i wanted to bring up more stuff. i ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that i should have thrown away. instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area. it looks so much better. i also got a new webcam. my mother had one at home that i wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one. my mother's a funny person. she came to the states during her college years about 20-something years ago. i wonder how her college experience was. it must have been hard. i can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying. i've experienced it. still, she managed pretty well, i suspect. she's just that type of person. she has a really strange accent though in her english. normally, asian people have a really ""fobbish"" horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different. it's not a perfect english accent but it sounds slightly european. i don't know why. my mom is a very peculiar person. oh, going back to the webcam thing. i think one day i was using her computer at home and i looked at her picture folder. there were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits. i almost fell out of my chair laughing. my mom is so cute. i believe she chats more than i do online to her friends. we've never chatted before but now that i'm not home, we've started to talk online through msn messenger. it's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but i'm sure i'll be accustomed to it soon. my mom's awesome. i wonder how many of my friend's moms chat online to them. no one. well, no one that i've met anyway. now i've run out of things to say so i'm slowly gazing around this room. i'm next to a beigish wall. i don't think i enjoy the color beige too much. i wish i had better posture. typing on the computer makes me slouch. sitting back while reading makes me slouch. eating makes me slouch. i think i'm just a natural sloucher. i want to grow at least two more inches though. i look taller if i'd stand up straight but it's so hard. i also heard stretching makes you taller. i should try that sometime. i always say i'll start things and never do. or usually i start things that i never finish. i wonder if it's a kind of disorder. there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old. i should go flip through some of them before i leave. they look interesting. i like that old book smell. i don't know why. it'll probably make me sneeze. someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other. i should have smiled or something. i feel so rude and mean. i think i look mean when i feel emotionless or i'm not making any faces on purpose. my mom says asians naturally look angry all the time. maybe it's true. i should smile more often but then i feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself. oh well. it's college now, i'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway. time's up, i'm done.

"so i'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. i feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but i wanted to get it over with. it think it's funny that you, prof. penn, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. it must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my psy301. my mom is always reminding me that i didn't take it in high school and that's what i get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. it shouldn't be a horrible class though. i can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. i love writing. i've been writing a summer journal for the past 10 years and i love it. i'd love to write for a living but i just do the journal thing well. i could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything i want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than i thought. it's only been 3 minutes and 59, 4 minutes, 4 minutes and 5 sec. ok i can't do that forever. what would happen if someone imed me right now? would i fail the assignment because i stopped writing? i should have turned it off. yuck. i just burped. ew, i just wrote that i just burped. see, i had spaghetti for lunch and i can still taste it because the food sucks. i miss home all ready. i feel like a dork because i miss home, and i want to go home every weekend. i need to be social. i need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 6 minutes and 11 sec, 24, 16. ok i'll stop for real now. i am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't i? i guess no one will know. why do i even care? i keep switching in and out of i and i. capitals that is. i never do capitals when i'm typing on aim so why should i do it now. i don't think it capital letters. ! well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. i hope this works because i don't have a printer that will verify that i actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, i live in san jac and i had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. i wouldn't talk to her even if i wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird! i guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. i've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez i'm a dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified i'd be. i just try to blend in everywhere. i know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, i would die of embarrassment. i'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, i miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from gr came down to hang out with him, and i got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. i'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and i don't. i guess i'm jealous? i don't think so. i don't know. i wish he would just not nap right now when i could be talking to him. i can be mad about that right? he could talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh i'm kinda thirsty, can i stop to get a drink. i guess i can wait 10 minutes. hey this is my favorite frank sinatra song. luck be a lady. man i want to do a dance to this. i want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things i want to do at my wedding, but i wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me i'll be cut off when i get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. i wish money mattered a little to him. not a lot but a little. i like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it? oh geez, well, why does it matter? you probably won't even read it. why would you read my paper out of the 2300 people that you have in your classes? 5 more minutes. i'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but i got enough sleep. maybe i got too much sleep. i hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. i don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh! my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 4 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. i want to go out tonight. i don't want to see major again and i don't really want to hang out with da, but i feel like i need to go out and do stuff. i'm really sick of eating by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me? lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, i'm a giant dork. wow. how mortified i would be if you knew who i was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. i'd probably cry and run out. i've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. i really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. i had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and i had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. i hope you never read this, and i hope i get credit for it. all i ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. i would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 55, 56, self destruct, ?

"i'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment. it's only been 17 seconds, i have a long way to go. my stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, i wish he would go away. there's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. i wonder what we'll eat tonight. i'm tired of jester pizza. it's really not that good. now it's only been a minute and 37 seconds. 40 seconds. stupid kid keeps i'm-ing me. good now he signed off. my roommate is reading the fourth harry potter book and i can hear her turning the pages. she is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but i don't know if i should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. i've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. my sandal just fell off and i wonder where it went. my roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. i think it was soup. who drinks soup out of a cup? aren't you supposed to use a spoon? maybe we're out of spoons. that's no good. i'm going home this weekend so maybe i'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. my phone is ringing and i'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend keith but i'm not going to answer it. i'll probably tell him it's because i'm writing this, but i really just don't feel like talking to him right now. his new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but i don't really want to. i don't like being the plan b. i don't think it's very fair. the page scrolled down enough that i can't see how much time has passed. i'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes. does this thing stop when it's 20 minutes? now my roommate is writing something. my foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. oh well. i wonder when that water bottle is from. yesterday i think. my printer has a blue button. i'm getting kind of bored of this and i don't really like to type. i hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. why can't people just call you on the phone? it's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. now i'm staring at the wall. it's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. we tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. my best friend kristyn got a bunch of them for me. too bad she is not here. we're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. anyway, friday night is when we're going out to dinner. i haven't seen her in a week, which i'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when i lived at my parents house so i'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. she is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. i always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. i think if i reread this, i'd probably think i was crazy. all of this is pretty random. i want the phone to ring because now i'm in the mood to talk to him. he is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. i think this is probably a bad situation. he wants us to be friends. he is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. he is not a very good people person i guess. my roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. i have a pencil from the greensheet and i don't remember where i got or who could have possibly left it here. where did it come from? do people actually read the greensheet? i've never seen someone reading it. kinda weird. my mom works for the austin american statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in hr. time must be almost up. ha, it does tell me when this is over!

"well, i've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. right now, i'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. i think stephen was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. i just found out today that the classes i plan on taking over the next 3 and a half years will earn me a bs in computer science, and a bs in mathematics. at first i just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when i was talking to dr. turner today he told me that i should check to see how much of the major i would be completing. i hope a double major will help me get into grad school. right now i really want to go to carnegie mellon to do my grad work. they have a really great cs program there. that's assuming of course that i remain a cs major over the next few years. but i don't see my interests changing or anything. i really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. we're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. luckily this is typed and not spoken. well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. i misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. its really bugging me, so i think i'll go fix it right now. i know that if i look around my room i'll see something that i want to talk about. usually that subject will be computer related. its really sad. (sad but true dear reader) why does that make me think of high school. weird flashback i guess. never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because i had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. all extremely intelligent. i wish i could meet more intelligent people here. most of the people i know are either average, or just plain dumb. i did meet some cool people in my cs 307 class. but its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. that reminds me of the math problem i solved today. professor freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. he encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. well, so far i'm the only one i know who came up with a solution to his problem. the last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. i wrote a dinky little program in c to compute all the data, and then i pasted it all into excel to plot it. right now i have another program like that running. its been running for about 140 hours right now. something like that. its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. these aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). so i hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. the rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. it reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl i sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. i really disagree. writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. you can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where i need to be able to type as fast as i can or i can't remember what i was thinking. i wonder how long i've been typing. probably at least 15 minutes. i really haven't been keeping time. oh well, once this hits a page on size 12 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when i paste it on the web). my dvd player comes in pretty soon. i've been waiting for at least a month because the first one i got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. i need to buy some dvds for it. probably will get the utena dvds even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. i like anime.

"lately i think of how i have to study and study hard because i would hate to be putting my family's financial status at risk. then i keep an eye out for work thats on campus and make plans to call only i wonder why i'm not getting on the ball with what i know is important. i'm worried about money, very worried about not following throught and disappointing my parents. you know i feel like going back to arlington and visit my family and friends, but i don't want them to think that i'm very homesick cause i don't think that i am . not really. it's relaly only been two weeks away. but it will be labor day weekend so it's okay to be home, i think. wandering if my mom actually plans on meeting my boyfriends mom. kinda nervous because his mom just found out we were going out and so . who knows what she's thinking. i'm trying to figure out how to tell my dad. he reassured me that he's not setting limits on me just that he wants me to take care of school first. why is it my roommate and best friend seems to be in this room as little as possible. i think i'm in here more than i should be but then i like being alone sometimes. wonder if my friends think that i'm just anti-social and don't want to try things. i don't go out of the room except to run, go to class, do an errand. just remembered that i have to go get some handbook for art class and its sold at i t copy. i just don't feel like going to get it right away. think i'll get it after a class tomorrow since i'm already going to be out. don't want to go to room and then go back out until i have class. why do i wait? my dad told me not to put things off, and i said i know but i still do it. scary thinking that i have a whole 4 maybe 5 years of schooling left until i am really on my own. i feel kind of on my own right now. just without parents. when i think of my parents i remember when they left after helping me move in. the days before i thought i was going to cry when they said goodbye because i have been so family-oriented but as they left i came close to tears but they didn't come. hmm that's weird. i love my mom so much that i can't think of why i didn't break into tears. she's always been there. and my dad. well. i came very close to it when he told me he loved mebecause i think the last time i heard him say that to me was so far back i can't remember. then my boyfriend came to spend time with me before he starts school. i was pretty sure i would be okay and that i wouldnt cry. then he left and i cried. lots. strangely he came back and then when he really had to leave i didnt cry. people have a way of disappointing you and making you feel bad. i thought this guy was my friend even when we were distant and then i had to find out that he told a girl i am no longer friends with that he didnt like me. i was in shock i didnt know what to do. my friends have a thing for changing their minds quickly and then saying that they are not different.

"in the eighteen years of my life i've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. i was born with one. in my heart i bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. what is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. i believe that education can free a man. an educated society becomes more aware. it can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. it has become my belief that i or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. the conscience in me longs to make a difference. to scream at the top of my lungs, ""this is wrong! you are wrong! give back his rights! give back what does not belong to you!"" but i know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. this gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, i am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. my first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. more likely i am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. within me i feel no intimidation toward others strengths and i take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. determination is the driving force of my soul. being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. i know only if i want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. it seems forever that i have expected highly of myself. with every aspect of my life i feel a certain pull to be the best i can be. rarely do i accept being less. my love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. i cannot accept just reading new knowledge. it is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. this allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for i do not like being put in the dark. i must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. this gives me confidence and strength. hopefully, i will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world.

"my side really hurts. i wonder if i have appendicitis or something. i wonder if i pulled something this morning in that dance class. that guy was so hot. and such an amazing dancer! i wish i could move like him. the way he was able to separate his joints and dance so flowing was so cool. i can't wait to see their performance this friday. i also can't wait to see the starting line. yay! i am going to fall in love with kenny and he is going to fall in love with me. oh crap, i need to find that confirmation number. i have a lot of work to do over these next few days. i hope tonight is fun, and worth the gas to get there. whitney seems to be a real bitch sometimes, i still hope i get to room with her. i wonder if this jessica girl is a lesbian. she sure is not the girl i thought she was, but i think i'll have fun with her in tuscon. the arizona dance thing sounds like so much fun. it seems like everything is just falling into place. i'm not really nervous about the audition for ua, but i probably will be later on. god, what is this pain in my side? i wonder if i should see a doctor, or wait, i already am. i am so sick of commuting to school. living on campus is going to be so nice. i need to send in my application soon. its cool that i saw adam today, and michael yesterday. i still like michael, damnit! i wonder if i'll ever get over him. oh but i'm marrying kenny so ill just have to. i really need to start eating more healthy. if i want to have a long career as a dancer, i should be taking better care of my body. but i'm not in that bad of shape. i'm probably overreacting. the thunder outside reminds me of the time i was in this room, and there was a tornado outside. i miss those times of being young, i really miss hawaii. i love austin though. now that i'm going to ut, i'm starting to realize how lucky i am to be going to school in such a cool place. i really hope i get into ua, or ocu, but i really hope ua. i know whatever happens, happens for a reason. i think going to ut this year was the perfect thing for me. i love it, and all the nice people i have met in dance, i feel right at home. i wonder if i'll want to leave. i shouldn't have eaten that nasty egg roll today, its probably what's making me feel sick. i hope i didn't offend jessica in anyway. no, i'm just overreacting. i really miss micheline. i wonder where she is, if she moved, why she hasn't returned my calls. she is so pretty, i wish i looked like her. i wonder what patrick is up to these days, i want to hear the songs he wrote about me, but it would be hard to call him after all this time. i'm not going to be another guys girlfriend unless i actually, truly like him. goddamn, didn't ben teach me that lesson? i hate ben. no i shouldn't say that, i loathe him. he disgusts me. should i spend the night at rachel's tonight? i can read chapter 22 tomorrow at 11, and then i'll go buy the tickets. i think i could afford to sleepover at her place then tonight. god, this pain won't go away! what is it? should i cut these bracelets off, they're starting to look a little scraggly. i can't wait to go swimming in that pool saturday morning, that's the day of the concert! i am going to give my number to kenny, no chickening out! he and i are meant to be, i just have to keep believing that. i kind of feel nauseous, its that pain in my side.

" how necessary is sleep? the past few days, i have been going to morning swim practice and then my 8 a. m. classes. is only four to five hours enough? i know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. but is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. right now i am feeling somewhat tired, but know that i have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will i get use to this kind of sleep cycle. also i wonder if i am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. are my notes as good as they should be or should i be taking more during class? i write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do i need more details in order to do well. the past few days i have recieved two different parking tickets, that i thought were unnecessary. i double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. the signs indicated that i wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if i could find a spot. but after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, i guess i now have to pick a different location. i wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. i wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. the front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. this is mainly because of the lack of evidence that i have, which i think is incredibly stupid.

"i am sitting in my dorm room right now and i just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because i don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on tv. i was so stressed out earlier today because i can not hack it in my calc. class. i went to class though only to affirm what i had previously believed. yeah right. i used to think i was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that i am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. simply for the fact that math is required. i am actually happier though because now i have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. i like that. i like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. i am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. i also added rtf 305 to my schedule. i am so excited for it. people annoy the crap out of me. sometimes i wish i could just crawl into a box and never come out. call me a crab but i don't really care. i am what i am. i feel chubby right now. i want to eat but then i don't. i know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when i don't truly want it. wasters never want. . . good quote. very true. i have come so far in my life. i can't believe i am finally at college. . on my own. there are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways i am lucky. it is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. that is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. falling short of the glory of god. it is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. i lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and i also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! i will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. i can't believe i used to sell knives this summer. seems like 3 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. one day, i hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. i would pay good money for that. i am sure every woman in the u. s. would do the same. i bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. i tan too often but i do like the feeling and i am not going to stop.

""" stream of consciousness "" everyday about now, i am still sleeping. i feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. i thought i would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but it has not hit me yet. this morning, while watching cnn, and still seeing the coverage of princess diana, made me sad. it makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. he had ten hours of surgery. what pain i thought. i kept on asking myself why did g-d let him live. why not someone like princess diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. she did so much for other people. she even raffled her dresses of for charity. what a women. i'm feeling a little bit tired now. the psy experiment i did today was a fun experiment. i enjoyed it. i sat next to a cute girl. i hope today's classes will go fast. i would like to take a nap today. just to sleep and rest for an hour. it was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. it was a nice surprise. also, i saw one of my friends from home on campus. it is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. my mother went on business and i hope she is doing well. i hope she got well rested today. i hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. i try to put myself in a better mood everyday. i think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. an example is i worry about friends, family, grades, whether i am behind or don't understand something in a class. i also do not like change. i don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. i try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes i feel it is harder than normal. i spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. i have so much to thank for but i feel that i am always asking g-d to help me in a situation. i enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. i enjoy school and friends. i feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. i had a very rough summer due to the fact that i had irritable bowel syndrome. it was very painful and i did not like the pain. a doctor prescribed me some medication. what upsets me is that one of my friends i feel is rude at times. i feel this because last night he was rude when i went to his room and he started yelling that i was disturbing his speech. i continue to be nice to him. i am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. he can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. i feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. sometimes i'm angry at him and sometimes i'm not. sometimes i feel sorry for him and sometimes i don't. i walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. the fraternity buys all his children gifts for christmas and i think it's nice. sometimes i feel sorry for him. he is a nice man. i also feel sad sometimes because i wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. i do not get along with him very well. sometimes i get very upset thinking about it. i often thank g-d that i have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. i miss my dog. he is so cute. i didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. usually i hear him barking when i am on the phone with my parents, but i have not heard him recently. when i visit home in a couple of weekends, i would like to spend a little time with him. he is a very nice and loving pet. he is old but still wild. i hope my girlfriend comes home with me. she said she would. her father is coming up to austin on thursday and we are going to dinner with him. this makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? i think. i miss my family. they are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. i hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. i have not given my id to anyone. i will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. maybe i won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. i will see. i hope to watch melrose place tonight. i have a lot of homework but i hope to watch it anyway. i have a lot of reading to do and i hope i complete. i think i will or come very close to it. i sometimes do not feel 100 percent. right now i am getting a little tired. i think i might nap after lunch. i think we are having steak today. i usually think of steak for dinner but i guess it is okay. yesterday i read for a long time. i didn't get as much reading done as i would of liked, but i am trying to keep up and i understand most of the information in the readings. i have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. maybe i won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. i would get a lot done because no one would be here. i am more tired now. i hope today's classes go fast and i have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! i hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. she is truly my best friend. guy or female -- i think she is my best friend. another best friend is my friend traylyn. he is nice and i have known him since third grade. i am probably going to pray later today. i was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so.

"i am an architecture major. therefore i do not sleep. last night i was able to sleep simple because i couldn't go any longer without closing my eyes. i wish that i had the choice to fall asleep and wake up at will. that time would simply stop when my head hit the pillow (or drafting table) so that i wouldn't lose any work time. if this were so, life would be much easier. without taking time out of my life to shower, eat or sleep i could get everything done. what is the true purpose of bathing anyway? i mean, i do it for the simple fact that i'm told by society that it's necessary for me to be accepted by the general populous. but, in all reality, if we didn't shower none of us would know the difference. i think that's my main complaint about the world in which we live. there is too much us. why can't it just be i, sometimes? rather than worry constantly about what sarah might wear or what jessica might do with her hair, why can't we just live and experience and be without the everpresent pressure of impression and attitude. when, i'm inclined to wonder, did everyone begin to care so much about trying so damn hard to lose their own individuality. what's the most disgusting, i believe, is that there are those out there who try so hard to find their own that, eventually, even that catches on, and then, once again, they become part of a click or group. here in lies my love and passion for architecture. but, it will also be my crutch, and possibly my ultimate failure. with it i can create and design and people will experience what i'm feeling and they won't be able to say, ""wow, that's cool, why don't i do that,"" without enlisting my services. (in a perfect world) they will, however, be able to say ""wow, that's cool (or awful as the case may be) i want to be in this space. "" on the opposite note, however, the only way i'll be able to express myself through my work will be to appeal to the masses or at least a mass large enough to want to pay me to build my building. so, in order for me to survive and be able to be different and interesting, i will have to find a group of people that are on the same wavelength as i am, which is essentially what i'm trying to avoid. it's a catch22 and there's no way around it. i suppose i could step to the side and be a howard roark of the world and live day by day surviving off the few people who may honor my integrity and desire for design, but, just like everyone else, i crave human contact and acceptance. i am too afraid of myself to be myself. i am too afraid to find out that i don't know what i am or to realize that everything i thought was, i'm really the opposite of and have only been playing a game my entire life, just trying to make an impression. i am so scared that i really am a failure, but somehow i've been lucky. somehow, i pulled off those sat's and i pulled off those straight a's, but as soon as i find out who i really am, i'll fall off of this full speed train toward success and end up in a field somewhere surrounded by no one. i don't even want to be successful anymore. i don't even want to be anymore. i just want to experience. i just want to know and think without the pressure of success or failure. i'm not sure what we're all trying for, but i do know that whatever it is, can wait until we've died.

"annoyance is about the only word i can think of at this moment to describe how i feel. today has been awful. why doesn't anything ever work out the way i wish it would? everything i needed to accomplish today has been a filure> i can't find a job because i can't get on a computer because me uteid is all out of wack. i miss my friends back home and i miss being a part of my family. they just seem to go on so wonderfully without me. i guess i am the one who wanted to move out and be independent, but it'd be nice to know they all still care about me and are concerned with how i'm doing. it's so hard being so alone all the time. i wish i were making more friends. i wish i would join an organization or i wish i had rushed. maybe life would be more fun if i were in a sorority. maybe i just wasn't cut out for college. i want to be grown up and finished with college and heve my career so badly. i'm tired of just meandering around with no real purposee in my life. i want to start my real life, and i know this can't be it because i'm not happy with it. i want to fall in love and marry and have a family and a meaningful job. i just needsome meaning in my life. i don't know what i'm here for. i know what i want to do with my life, but time is getting in my way and i'm angry because of it. and i'm hungry; physically and metaphorically speaking. this cannot be the way college will be forever. it's so much worse thatn high school. it's so big. it intimidates me to think that there are more poeple on the ut campus thatn live in my home town. i have a class that has twice as many pople than i graduated with in it. it's a real shock. it's traumatizing to go from being well known and well loved to not being either one at all. it hurts deep down and is extremely depressing and discouraging. but i shouldn't let it get me down, i should hang on to the confidence i've still got, because it's the only thing that can get me through ""the best years of my life"". yeah, right.

"i've spent my second day at the university of texas and i'm trying not to hate it. i feel lonely and depressed. i miss wesley, i miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when i first went to wesley i hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now i know what the other extreme feels like, i really miss it. i kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when i was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in boston. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people i know. i feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. i can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if i'll like them, because i don't see anyone who fits my idea of what ""friend"" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with kate yesterday because i didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- i say that joking of course, but i guess i feel like i can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - i mean i know who she is and it's what i expect. i'm so glad she came here too - i don't know what i would do if i were totally alone down here. i think it's really a different experience for me because i've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here i don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. i didn't expect to miss wesley so much. i thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone i've seen is the sorority'frat type and i hate it! i never thought wesley was that diverse or funky, but i guess i've realized what i had all along. maybe i'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. i mean i know there are plenty of wendy wesley oh-so-perfect women at wesley who drive me up the wall, but i know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say? i just had an argument with my mom and i feel really guilty, i haven't seen her a lot lately and i was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how i should rrahhhh - i hate that. i told her that i was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me i can't do it, right when i'm in the middle of an assignment. i'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. i'm at acc where i worked this summer and i came here because 1-i have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 2- i thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like i still mattered to someone. now i just feel like hell. i think i want to cry, but i always feel so crappy when i do that - since i usually do it for some really stupid reason, like i feel like a jerk or something. god, i just feel like telling everyone to shove it today! what a way to start the semester! ok, i'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. i'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but i hope i can. i really want eric to go, but i'm not sure if i want to want him to go. i hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, i'm sick of getting hurt. i think i might just like him because he's there and i'm feeling so lonely right now. i don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal? i'm not sure. i keep going over this in my head - why can't i find the right one? not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that i really like' one that fits all the qualifications i want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. i'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, i can't fully concentrate on what i'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there.

"i don't know if i can handle all of this. every semester i procrasnated with only 13 hours to worry about. and for the first time, in a long time, i am facing reality and taking my school work and my life seriously. the good thing is that i have a loving mother who understands me most of the times; i have a father that i do love and who does love me, but i don't watn to get in to it; and my pride and joy is my boyfriend who i love dearly, and labor day is our first year anniversary. i have no clue what to get him. i mean we've always given each other what's in our heart (we don't like superficial stuff)--i've made many creative stuff like ""two peas in a pod"" with clay, paper mashad hearts for christmas, cranes in a bottle,. and he too have made me stuff like putting our baby pictures to gether in a frame, written me poems, made a model plymouth plower (my favorite car last year), and he even went so far as to sew a heart for me. for a guy to sew is absolutely a amazing. it was so poorly put togther, some strings were loose, some parts were't even attached. etc, but it was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen. i must have cried, partly because i was mad at him at the time because i felt that he was not thinking too much of me. was i surprised. so here's a delinma. how can i show him what he means on our anniversary when all my ideas have been used? plus i only have exactly 6 days to do this? i was originally going to draw the entire disney fairy tale characters, but he doesn't like disney. i was thinking of writing him a poem, but i'm just so much better at prose. so far, my idea is to just to write him a book with old scripture. hopefully, with everything that i have to do this week, i'll be able to write it.

"it is hard to put thoughts and feelings into words. the air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. my stomach has felt bad all day, i took pepto bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. i'm tired, and it's only 10:00. this house is always so messy, i wish bryan would help me keep it clean. i'm going to start doing better. the picture of deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. what am i going to wear tomorrow? i don't want to have to wake up early. i have to wake up at 9, i guess that isn't that early. i had so much fun at my family reunion. i miss my family even though i just saw them 2 days ago. some woman on the tv was trying to kill her kid, kathy bush wanted to kill her daughter? the news is so horrible. it's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. i think more people should be executed. the government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. if someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. i can't wait until christmas. i already know what i'm going to get bryan and my mom, and my dad. we're going to get my dad a 56 k modem. he's wanted one for a long time. what a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. oh well. i don't want to type for 12 more minutes. i think this assignment is stupid. i don't see the point. or maybe there is a point, but i'm not helping because i'm doing it wrong. what does it matter, is anyone really going to read this? i feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. oh good, i didn't want bryan to come over and read this, he left the living room. our apartment is pretty smalll but i resally like living in austin. finally, he's going to take out the trash. only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 60 years for molesting a child. what makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. i think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. they are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. i think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. i hate democrats. i hate bill clinton. i will be so glad when he is no longer our president. i hope bush runs next year, i know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 7 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 7:30. so should i go to the trig review class or should i go to church? i think i'll end up leaving early from class so i can make it to church. i need to get my priorities straight. it's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. i want to save peolpe from going to hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. now i'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like i""m some crazy conservative person. narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. the bible says loud and clear that more people will go to hell than heaven.

"well, here i am on friday, september something. ever since i started college i've had a hard time keeping up with the date. not really a smart thing to do since i have to stay on top of things here. i need to start keeping a daily planner. i say that everyday but then i forget to do it and it's just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do. i'm pretty hungry right now. no, i take that back, i'm not that hungry. i could eat but it's not to the point where i feel like i have to eat. my friend and i are going to lunch today. i'm so glad that i've made a friend that i can hang out with and talk to all the time. it's not the same like my friends at home though. i miss melissa and amber. i really don't know why it is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking. we talk about nsync a lot more now too. typical, we find comfort in them in our time of need. i wonder if the nsync guys would think that we're crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who justin belongs to and who jc belongs to. they crack me up. heck, i crack myself up. we talk on the phone and i have melissa and amber rolling on the floor with laughter. it's so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually i'm the one doing the laughter. a lot of times i just laugh to be polite. i fake it pretty well, if i do say so myself. i wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs? well, if this is just my one continuous thought then i guess not. okay, i love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes, could somebody please turn up the air conditioning. i think the university is trying to freeze us into studying. i hope they know that they're just freezing me into complaining all the time. and another thing, is it impossible for people to not slam their doors? really, it doesn't take that much effort to quietly close the door. i should randomly slam my door. i think every hour on the hour, i'm going to slam my door. no, that's not frequent enough. i'll slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point. really though, dorm life is not bad at all. my dorm room is so cute and i really like my roommate. no waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting. i still don't like to call this place home. home is where mom and wayne are. this is where i reside. it would take a lot for me to consider this place home. i need to do my biology homework. i wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are? the funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives. i can't even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap i'm going to do with the rest of my life. i'm pretty sure that life as a professional bum is out of the question. don't think mom would be proud of me then. okay, looks like my time is running out and i should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence. okay, how do i end this. i really don't know. this was actually kind of fun. just another way for me to analyze my random, boring, and crazy thoughts. red hot chili peppers on vh1 now. got to go. and we're out in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. bye! (it says that i can finish writing, but honestly i got a date with a fine young man named biology) ",0,-0.669509 -0.0214 0.912878 -0.081647 -0.033979 1.467026 -0.387553 -0.331889 -0.188005 0.106298 -0.185966 0.178101 -0.254147 -0.370591 -0.760464 0.0 -0.04277 -0.171533 -0.134164 2.198059 0.450366 -0.742368 -0.412558 1.101227 1.450831 0.020313 0.468006 0.044571 0.802746 1.394041 0.935552 0.226036 -0.332494 -0.906028 -0.199285 -0.384339 0.092281 -0.75932 0.221812 0.387698 -0.489992 -0.48939 -0.411796 -0.063199 -0.809347 1.016038 -0.798855 0.146134 1.086461 0.057981 -0.618206 -0.17008 -1.128226 -0.245647 -0.881575 1.309423 1.779085 -0.340848 0.175138 0.122086 -0.049049 -1.309081 -0.480161 -0.350225 -0.153978 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.164981 0.306193 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.190996 -0.19129 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.386894 0.427883 -0.148965 0.247273 4.777653 3.483452 4.606221 4.61652 4.759416,1559
"i am typing this paper because i have to. my roommate is asleep. i am listening to incubus music. i am listening to incubus. i just got off the phone with my girlfriend. she was annoying me. she was saying all this stuff about how i was flirting with this fat girl. and i was like what i did not flirt with the fat girl. and we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. but in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. the music i am listening to is so good i love listening to them. i am so mad. i did my calculus homework tonight and i missed a few problems. it makes me angry because my roommate and i both know calculus and i should have gotten them all right. i missed a few which was stupid, but i corrected them. but still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. if you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -100 to a 100 which makes no sense. i am so mad at this stupid grading system. because then i can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. i am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. and i messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. i cannot wait for this week to be over. i am having a bad week. the song i am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. i really have to go to the bathroom. i wish i could go. oh well, the music is good. i really like this writing assignment because i can write about whatever i want. i wish all writing assignments were like this. it is so cool to be able to write about anything. i love writing about what i am thinking, it is almost like a diary. it is good to be able to write about my feelings, i think this assignment is very good. i hope my girlfriend is not mad, i just thought about that. we talked tonight, and i think she might be mad with some of the stuff that i told her. i really hope she is not because i love her with all my heart, i hope she is nor going to blow anything ",0,0.461474 -0.63145 1.161808 -0.222414 0.54061 -1.657154 -0.059467 0.296853 -0.277482 -0.798712 -0.181187 -0.590446 -0.926471 1.589775 0.535422 0.0 -0.04277 1.570491 0.570872 1.302431 0.953049 0.616429 0.133641 2.626253 -0.624052 0.274117 -1.481744 0.057404 2.025282 0.519622 0.445375 0.078674 2.170696 -0.906028 3.954465 0.541946 -0.284547 1.370643 -0.764948 0.238332 -0.205508 -0.95456 0.086643 0.467227 -1.429535 1.95404 0.248657 0.648791 1.962068 0.597126 -0.609248 -1.673107 0.591361 1.17181 0.475559 -1.940184 -0.938569 -0.022837 1.240086 -1.595503 -0.66385 -1.158189 -0.480161 1.054039 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.272355 -0.62463 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.022802 -0.422267 -1.674882 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.96917 4.113835 4.93011 3.63374 4.195257 4.586839,2069

"today has been a very stress ful day starting with the first time i ever missed a class. today my parents and i got in a fight and i was going to be late to class so i decided to just not go. this caused my parents to be evenmore upset with me. not to mention that we were already stressed about the apartment situation for next year. isn't that retared to hav eto sign a lease in september for the following school year? you don't even know if you will get along with the people that you ahve agreed to live with for the entire year. a realty company makes everything so much more difficult. we have to pay a application fee and a security depsoit of $35 adn $480 respectivly. in the upcoming week we have to put our firsty monts rent down which is $481. it is just rediculous that we have to worry about this at this point in time. i am also extremly stressed about school. first of all i don't know what to expect coming from hogh school to college. second of all, all the professors throw all this stuff at you st once and expect you to remeber itall. it is completly over whelming to a freshman. third on my list, my soroity is also giving us all these dates to remember, things to sign up for, dues to pay, committments to fulfill that everything is all mumble jumble in my head. i am completely overwhelmded. foutrh of all, i never get any sleep. i had to go home to houston to get rest and to be able to study. fifth -- i have not been able to fit my routine work out into my schedule yet. i am terrified about gaining the freshman fifteen. this summer i wroked so hard to lose weight, and i finally did. i will be greatly depressed if i gain it back and more!!!! college is supposed to be the best four years of your life, but so far it has been one big stress pile up. i can;t take it. not to mention that i am completwly homesick. i am so close to my family it is ridiculous. i miss my mom to no extent. my sister just got engaged and i feel like i am missing out on all of the party plans. i feel so far away. my dad has to be the most unselfish wise person i know. he adds so much to a converation. i miass them all so much. everyhting brings me to tears these days if i start to think too long about it. one of the most important things in my life i forgot. my dog jake. i miss his sweet face so much. he was such a good friend and companion. i never have any time to email my friends in london or in other colleges around the nation. i also feel like i am having a hard time opening up to my surrounding s whether it is to my girlfriends or to guys. i wish everything wasn't always a drunken brawl. i don't mind the partying if it only were in moderation. anyways, i think i am just having to get adjusted and that it is just taking me longer than others. everything is all so important to me:grades friends, guys, family, beliefs etc. why can't evrything just be perfect????

" right now i'm thinking how much easier it would be to write assignment number 2. if there are no right or wrong things to write, i guess i should not worry. i believe i worry too much. it is hard to make this paragraph line up, the ends of each line that is. right i feel blank but the nice thing is since i wrote it out, my assignment is not a blank. if all assignments were this easy, i'd worry less. i'm hot, hungry and tired. all a result of college life i guess. so far, the class has been interesting. i have a feeling the class will get more serious. i generally stay away from computers, technology intimidates me. i like the simple things in life but the entire world is advancing so i must. for example, i am turning an assignment through the internet. its pretty crazy to me. my typing is slowing due to an interest in a video that is on and extreme hunger. i be hitting the submit button now.

" so today has completed a very odd and trying week. i have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and wow!!! i seem to find myself asking, have i over done myself? i am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this i got two kittens that require a lot of attention. this, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work i have to make sure i am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but i love them. my roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like i am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? i am not trying to say i don't take their words into consideration but i believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he'she learns. this is a test for me that i hope i don't fail at but all i keep telling myself is that i must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). i am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. she found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. the doctor said she should be alright but i still worry. i really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. all i can conclude is that i have been set a full plate that i now must eat. besides all the drama i just mentioned i have finnaly declared my major as child development' pre-med with a minor in psychology. this is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which i am very thankful for. i know it will be a lot of work but i love working with children, but now whether i follow all the way through with pre- med is a different story but i know eventually i will get through it and go to med-school. for right now i need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. another thing i am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that i could have gotten two tickets the the ou game and i passed up the opportunity. there goes a couple hundred dollars i coould have gotten off ebay. oh well, that's the way life goes. by the way, my boyfriend of three years, zack, took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. we had 12 courses in 5 1'2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). the cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). anyhoot i enjoyed writting and i will see you next time, bye.

"well i'm sitting at my computer and i don't really have much to say. for some reason i feel as though my mind is completely blank. my roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. i am so tired right now. last night i was up with no thoughts in my head. i was just not able to sleep for some reason. i really hope that this school year goes good for me. i know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. i have always dreamt of coming to college and now that i am finally here it still seems like a dream. i guess its just hard to believe that i'm on my own, six hours from home. i miss my old friends and my girlfriend, laura, i can't wait to see here this weekend. football season is about to start and i am getting so excited to see my first longhorn game. my mind just went blank again. no thoughts. i think i just used to many dots between words. my nose itches. i need to use the bathroom, but i still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and i don't want to stop now. for some reason it seems as though i have been here typing for a long time but really i haven't even typed much. maybe i type slow. i'm trying to think of what to type now. it seems so easy. ?just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe i'm trying to hard. the phone is ringing. i guess i'll get it. it is was my mom. yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. that sounds good to me because i could really use it right now. it looks as though i have barely typed anything. i'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. man i'm thirsty. i could use a spite or a cold coke. maybe i'll go get one in a little while, or not cause i need to save money. it's tough not having a job and wanting so much. i'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that i don't even need in the first place. six more minutes and i will be done. it actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. i wonder how my dog is doing. i hope my mom is feeding her just as i said, and giving her lots of water. she needs that especially in the hot sun. i can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. no thoughts. still none. i think i'm getting addicted to the dot thing. two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. every second seems to go by slower and slower now. i really don't want to drive home this weekend. i wish i could fly, but i'll be alright. i just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. well it's been twenty minutes so i guess i'm done.

"at my high school i graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. i try to sit close up to the front of the class so i don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; i think it helps. all in all, i think i am going to enjoy ""college life"". however, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. i don't think i have read so much of textbooks my whole life. also, i find the e-mail thing a little confusing. i didn't have e-mail at my school, and i wasn't online at my home computer so i am not up to date on all the terminology. i know i shouldn't be, but i am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. i am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though i am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than i am. ( i hope! ) lately, i find computers really frusterating. i am trying to get into the pretesting page for psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. i have already completed part of the pretesting survey, and i clicked done after each section so i hope it saved my work. every day after my classes, i feel like i have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes i realize i get too stressed out over nothing. i'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. i have also learned that if i write things down i will remember to do them, and i won't get stressed out worrying if i have forgotten to do a certain assignment. although i was a little worried after the first day of classes, i don't think college will be so bad as long as i keep up with my homework like i plan and don't procrastinate like i became so accustomed to in high school. i like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. this gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. i hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. my roommates and i had to drive to taco bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. and for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. i never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any.

"okay, here we go. i am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. i don't know how i can do this considering that i type pretty fast and also i am in the ugl and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that i type. oh well, no one seems to be listening. i am really tired right now and all i can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. it's only been one minute! i can't do this for that long. i have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm i had a fun time last night. i got in at 6 in the morning. if only my mother could see me now. that's the latest i've ever gotten in. am i typing loud? i don't want to do this anymore. i am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that i am typing. bored bored bored bored. i miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in barnes and noble i was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and i really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow i held it back. hell right now i want to cry. i really miss all of my dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. i guess it's inevitable, though. i mean i've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but i never thought that it really would be this hard. i'm living on my own. i am my own mother now. that's pretty damn scary! i think i'm responsible though. i've always been able to manage my time wisely. even my mom agrees with that. it's only been 3 minutes. or 4 maybe. i really like this guy i met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. i'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. i hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. i'm really paranoid right now. i don't want him to see that i'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks i'm stalking him anyway. i'm really not. i think i am inventing things in my head. i do that a lot. i can't believe i'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. well, hopefully not. i mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. yikes! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least i am assuming that it is. so, with that in mind i really am open to write whatever the hell i want to write. this is for my benefit, in essence. like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! i really like that guy. i hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe tuesday. hell, i'm sick of waiting around for this guy. i always do this. i cling on so fast to people i'm interested in even after just meeting them. it's like i have a onetrack mind and it's all i can think about. that's pretty scary, huh? wow i just scrolled up and i've written a lot. a lot of really boring stuff too. he probably won't call tomorrow. who am i kidding? i can't keep doing this to myself. it's really unhealthy. i just want to cry after realizing this. it's such a horrible thing. i am putting this guy up on a pedestal is that how you spell it? and like if he messes up just a little bit, then i think that he hates me and i'm just this horrible person. god i say the stupidest things around him sometimes. i'm so concerned with trying to impress him that i just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but i am again blowing it out of proportion. who am i kidding, i need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. like everyone i meet, i hold off on just for that rare chance that i might get to date this guy. i am a weird person. i am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. it feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. whoa that's scary. i love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. not really. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. i feel like each letter i type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. how did that go so fast? what did i write about? i can't even remember. i really don't want to look back at what i wrote either because i'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but i'm sure i will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, i envy your patience. until next time. that is all.

"so i'm in the computer lab of my apartment right now yeah these people in hear are kind of noisy. yeah i really wish i had my own computer, i talked with my dad today and he said maybe by christmas theses walls are interesting. they really need to put paper in the copier and printer. i have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that i can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. i'm thinking about what to write. what can i write that won't be too ummmm what's the word, i don't know lol. i wonder if they'll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah i don't seem like a weirdo hmmmm. i think i'll eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and i have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then i can eat the italian bread i got today with it too ah man i'm getting really hungry, lol. ah man, it's only been 4 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. like you can run a lap in 6o sec. doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesn't make any sense if you don't know what i'm talking about. there was something else i was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok i forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what i mean about the no computer thing? not having my own computer really stinks. so anyways. i think i'm going to work out tonight. i usually don't like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isn't too bad. i think that's because i can look out the window when i'm running lol, even as i'm typing this stuff i am thinking about totally different stuff than what i am typing. like when i was typing about the treadmill i was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since i've been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate let's me use her laptop sometimes so i don't have to come down here, but her keyboard is a french keyboard and it's really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow i fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because i was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb. i remember when i was little and i would be riding in the back of the car with my family and i would just be thinking to myself like everyone does, i guess, well anyways. and i remember how i would go backwards on my thoughts and think of how i got to what i was thinking about. probably what this writing assignment is trying to do well anyways. ooooo those brownies sound really good too. maybe i'll make brownies when i get back upstairs ooooo those sound so good. i am so hungry!!!! i don't know what i would cook them in though. i don't know if we have a pan i guess i'll find out when i get back upstairs i'm almost done with my laundry. i need to start reading the psychology book too and taking notes. lol, i don't think i actually think about all the stuff i have to do as much as this writing assignment may make it seem i really hope i like architecture. lol, that was out of no where too. well actually the truth is that i can't type as fast as i can think and while i'm typing i'm actually thinking about other stuff than what i am typing. hmmm l4 minutes what made me think about architecture was that i was thinking about psychology and that made me remember how i thought about majoring in psychology (that's really hard to type!), but that was after i had already made up my mind to major in architecture. i don't know if architecture is just a phase or if it's something i really want to do. i don't know. we'll just have to see how it goes really i wonder why the time thing is green anyways. i really, oh now i forgot. oh wait. i really hope it works out. i've even thought about government though so i can do something about women's rights, i think that would be cool. maybe i could do both could i do both? i don't know this is so confusing, how are you suppose to already know what you want to do with your life!!?? but of course derek always knew he wanted to be a pilot. l7 min. now i wish i had more time i hate how everyone is oooooo ahhhhh air force academy. who the heck cares, its just the air force academy and no it's not impossible to get into i could have gotten in if i wanted to but i didn't want to i have no sympathy lol, yeah probably none of this makes a lot of sense since you don't know what i'm talking about. but i don't think that's the point. it's just to see how one thought leads to another and then another and so on. not really mattering what your thoughts actually are. just so you can see how one thing leads to another. lol, i am so redundant!!!!

"i'm watching my breath. listening to it enter and exit my body. it is quiet. there is a bit of tension in my sinuses and my jaw is slightly tightened as well. my mind is quiet. now i am back in pennebaker's class on wednesday. i'm sitting in this incredibly crowded room with over five hundred students in it. someone is sitting on the floor. pennebaker has a microphone! the feelings of being back at school again. it is nice for this to be semester number two at ut. it's easier to get around. but still a shock to be back on campus with fifty thousand other humans after spending a month hiking in the mountains on the other side of the world. all of the traffic: cars, bikes, pedestrians, are such a foreign scene after the solitude of the mountains. although this scene is not so different from the crowded streets of delhi, india. my memories of the mountains in nepal continue to surface. different parts of the trip. i remember so much so vividly. the day that ramesh and i left kag beni for jomsom and walked along the river. it was wide and roaring. the wind blew hard. at times the river bed was so wide that we could walk along the dry part of it. i hummed ""dust in the wind"" by kansas feeling the immensity of this land and the tiny insignificance of my small person as i walked through it. a little bit frightening, a little bit mystifying, a little bit liberating. now we're in jomsom, waiting for a plane that will come and leave again without taking us back to pokhara. we are sitting with a bunch of old nepali men who are chatting about the dangers of the planeor so i figured, they spoke only in nepali. i feel an odd bond with these old men that i cannot understand. they are part of me. there's a monk waiting for the plane as well and when it comes, takes some passengers and leaves us behind, he, along with ramesh and i decide to walk back to pokhara. the stress of traveling in a foreign country that has a different perception of time is difficult to adjust to. ramesh and i are driving on his motorbike toward kathmandu from pokhara. monsoon rains have caused landslides along the road and we cannot pass. there are many people waiting to pass, including many distraught westerners. the urge to become stressed out is very strong, but i have to smile. what am i worried about? things will work out. now i am home, back to the fast paced society where i have spent most of my life. in the airport in detroit, the first thing i notice is how fastpaced everything is. people all seem to be in a hurry. i practice buddhist meditation and this helps me to focus my mind and not run off with all of the stresses and worries that are present each day. but what makes us live in this way? we move so fast that often we are not able to enjoy the life that is right in front of us. i return to the mountains. now i am on poon hill. the first morning that i have seen the annapurnas. it's really early and the sun is rising over the mountains. we're sitting on a picnic table that looks out on an immense valley that meets the grand peaks. i can sit here all day. i feel so open and expansive. now we're in tatopani. ramesh, dhundup and i are staying at a lodge right next to the hot springs which we enjoyed earlier. now it's dinnertime and we're sitting on the patio, drinking hot tea and cold fanta. ramesh and i are playing chess. i don't know how to play, but am excited about surrendering my fear and trying something new. as i walked up to the table, ramesh's smile lit up his entire face and my entire insides. as we play chess, we continue to exchange looks that are full of energy. three weeks later, when i finally depart pokhara, i blow him a kiss as i get on the plane. so many incredible new experiences that have molded and shaped my life in amazing new ways. when thinking about this trip, i feel open and expansive in a new way. i feel incredibly happy. i deserve to feel happy after the struggles of the spring of this year. oh, and my time was up. until next time!

"it is weird to be here because usually people are here and i could visit them but no one is at home. my brother is now doing all the stuff i did last year and it's kind of a weird role reversal. i am also frustrated because i am here and if it was normal circumstances jared would be here but of course his family decided to take a vacation and they are out of town. and it's so weird and frustrating to be here and not be able to just call him and see him, i guess it is part of the annoying ""sensitivity"" that girls seem to employ. i need to get out of that habit. but, in an hour and a half or so, i will be driving back to ut and bringing my roommate's and also my friends from here. the whole situation did not work out exactly how we planned because i was going to stay here this whole weekend but then jill's ride got all messed up so if i don't bring her up today i have chris and emily who will be very disappointed and i would feel guilty if i just stayed here instead. but actually i kind of just do want to stay here at home for awhile and actually get some stuff done and just relax but i also am torn the other way too. whatever, my mind is so strange sometimes. and also i am feeling stupid writing all these thoughts down. am i going to be diagnosed with some kind of disorder by what i've written? rhetorical question. computers can be very frustrating. it is really getting on my nerves that i am not allowed to complete my pretesting requirement on here. at first i couldn't even access the screen to type in my social security number and then when i could do that it won't accept my password or user name. that is all very frustrating and i've tried all these different computers trying to access it. oh well. hopefully, i will finally figure it out. as i just skimmed over what i've written thus far, i am worried. the blurb above says there is no right or wrong thing to say but i have before, just done completely the opposite of what was intended on an assignment and i had to redo it so this makes me slightly nervous as to if the content of this is adequate or not. it is very quiet in this area right now and my thoughts seem so loud in comparison since they are all that i can ""hear"" and it all the activity that is going on. this assignment is actually kind of ironic because usually, i do write down everything that is in my head, like my thoughts and my feelings, and it helps me sort things out. it usually angers my friends because then they never know what upset me before because i wouldn't say anything because i'd have to go write it down to figure it out. yet, while i'm typing this, it seems so forced to have to write down my thoughts. i guess because the ""audience"" i am typing for is so unknown and i feel self conscious of what i write. i just thought about this calculus homework i've been trying to work on for the past hour or so. it is so aggravating to try and understand something and completely fail or only understand a little bit which does nothing for progress toward solving the problem. i guess that is something i miss. i miss my smaller classes where there was always a lot of discussion and interaction. i guess in a way i'm being selfish but i can't help feeling that way. oh well, i guess i am still in transition but i'm used to everything i just am not sure how much i like everything. well, i guess that is all my thoughts for now. i am so random sometimes. my train of thought that leads me to some comment or question is sometimes so mixed up and completely out of nowhere that i can't even believe how i think of some things. i'm not sure. but i bet a psychologist somewhere could figure that dilemma out. : ) ",1,1.220493 -2.105558 -0.969212 -1.999243 -1.705572 -2.448813 0.836553 0.657746 1.088803 0.242617 -0.070351 -0.202711 -0.469586 0.603079 1.568623 0.0 -0.04277 -0.357321 -5e-06 -0.576514 -0.155256 -0.742368 -0.737367 0.724204 -0.130704 -1.143091 0.214043 -0.668493 -0.003001 -1.077005 -1.100231 -0.170186 1.188545 0.239189 1.058388 0.269725 0.959641 1.050677 0.635813 0.012144 -0.516832 1.948189 2.42722 -0.653842 -1.134609 -0.08253 0.307618 -0.972486 0.155289 -1.005635 -0.884899 -1.090838 -0.233132 0.012611 0.441348 2.537811 0.350841 1.379344 1.772598 1.164834 -0.141538 0.614397 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.721501 -0.437633 0.060132 -0.23436 -0.354574 -0.37208 -0.337085 1.497877 -0.12248 -0.451544 -0.161673 -0.725899 4.565029 4.484537 4.246289 4.518638 4.44304,441
"well, i really don't know what to talk about now. i can't really think of what i am feeling. i guess relaxed and at the same time stressed. i have so much chaos in my life now that i can't even think straight. i just moved to a new city and a new home. i joined a soroity where i am suppose to meake all new friends in 1 week or less. i have a boyfriend that is non-exsistent in my life now. i have school work that i don't even know how to work on. i am just a mess. i am going home next weekend so maybe that will calm my nerves. i was very much overwhelmed when i came here about 3 weeks ago. i wasn't ready at all for this new experience in my life. i was but i wasn't at the same time. i was so ready to leave my parents but not to be on my own all the time. i sometimes feel depressed that i have no life but in actuality i really have it the best. i am waiting for my ""boyfriend"" to come and see me tomorrow. i have been waiting for 2 weeks. don't know how long it will last. there are a lot of guys here that are also interested. i don't know. one minute i feel upset and just want to cry and roll up and the next i just want to go out and have so much fun. i miss my parents and brother so much. my dogs are also important to me and i dearly miss them. in high school i never use to study and now i am forced to or i will fail. which the tachers don't give a crap about if anyone fails or not. in high school they did. i have so much to get use to and i am scared to tell the truth. i don't know why this is a question because no one will read this so i won't get into a lot. i am having fun though. i have met some really cool people and i know we will be friends for a long time. my soroity has also been a big aspect in my life right now. aephi is the name of it. i feel comfortable there and i know i will enjoy it immensley. well, i don't know what else to talk about. i hope everything will turn out for the better and i can realx and actually enjoy myself and everyone else.

"well here i am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always, constantly hitting the backspace key. i just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books i have is signifigantly cheaper there and then i registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like i could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade at the going away dance only for eighth graders i won a bag of blowpops huge bag and i never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer i would find one and throw it away. my roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already i'm still just kind of trudging along. i'm really tired its time to go to bed i wonder if i should take advil because i had my wisdom teeth out on friday but i'm really tolerant to pain so i never even took the perscription pain medication- but i have no idea if anything is wrong because i just sort of ignore the pain. after i finish this i am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she doesn't know who of her friends will be here so he might stay in our dorm but i know that they won't do anything i'm probably going home because i live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it won't bother me he's a nice guy- i have only known jenny for 5 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too. we both grew up in the us with parents from taiwan so we have similar backgrounds. i filled out that survey it was so strange and so long. the pre-test thing. i'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives i'm such an innocent and i don't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions. one of our suite mates rushed and she got into zta and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and i asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because it's the first day of school and she has an 8:30 class tommorow but oh well it's not might life or my concern. this room is so cold. and she seems so smart to she took all the ap classes and i think she was on drill team too. and she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok i don't need a guy to make me happy even though i would like a boyfriend- i've never had one before that is so strange but that's ok. i saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that's ok. there are a few of us from church here also clement who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my differentials on norton or something- my brother like icqed me and told me to do it at least once a week i had no ide what he was talking about and i tried to do it. i can't believe i have so much to do already i have a lot of classes i thought it would kind of be like high school but i don't think so i saw a few people around campus that i know from church it was really weird thinking i knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 15 minutes early but that won't last long- especially those 8 o'clock classes oh i think i need to charge my cell phone i'm not sure oh well. well i think my twenty minutes is up and i'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so i guess i could read sociology until she is done but. well good night.

" lately, i have been having all sorts of feelings. all my life i have lived in san antonio, tx and now moving to austin feels so different. i feel so lonely because i barely have any friends in austin and i am to shy to approach people. hopefully my year will get better. i don't think that my roomate is too fond of me. i don't understand why she barely talks to me? i try to be friendly. all i do all day is read or call my friends back in san antonio so that i don't feel lonely. it's odd really that i talk to my mom quite often on the phone. on top of that i have problems with my boyfriend. i don't know what's wrong with me, but i am having serious trust issuses. i have been with him for four years and i should be able to trust him, but he lives so far away and i don't get to see him much. how do i know if he's doing any thing behind my back? should i even think like this? does he trust me? i really do love him. only recently did i discover that i love him. i wonder if the two of us will ever be together in the future. i really hate my culture when it comes to this kind of stuff. why do we have to have arranged marriages? what is the point in that? i hope i do well in school this year. last year i got good grades, but i really want to make my parent sproud. i feel bad fo rthem really. they pay so much money for my education and living. i feel as though i owe it to them to make them proud after all that they do for me. i really should get a job, but my schedule really doesn't allow me to. i'm not done with class till 5 everyday and i start the day as early as 8. hopefully next year my schedule will be better and i can get a job and take on some responsibilities for myself. living away from home is so different. it's strange really. i didn't think that i would miss home so much. i was so glad to finally leave and be on my own and have freedom. i don't even know where anything is in austin and i hate bothering the people that i do know in austin for directions. i don't know if it bothers them that i keep calling. maybe i should join a sorority or something so that i can meet more people. i wonder if i can even handle being in a sorority with school work though. i can't believe i actually decided to change my major. from computer science to nursing, wow that's a big change. well all i know is that i want to do something dealing with kids because i love kids and they usually love me. i don't want to be a teacher and not a doctor because that is way to much schooling for me. i think being a pediatric nurse will give me the oppurtunity to interact with children and help them. if only my mom would be happy with the decision i made. i don't know what her problem is anyways. it's my life, i should be able to do what i want and what make me happy. to tell you the truth about what i am thinking at the moment right now, i am really scared about this writing assignment my hands are shaking and i have no idea why. it should be easy for me like writing in my diary . i guess it's because of the fact that i am going to be graded on it. o well, hopefully i do well. i'm really tired and my back is hurting me and my time is almost up, so goodbye i'm going to sleep.

"i am sitting at my kitchen table right now and i am really frustrated. i am trying to write an english paper and it is so bad. i think i am so stupid sometimes. it really frustrates me when i can't do something perfect. i am also feeling kind of lonely today. i wish i was living at hardin house because that is where all my friends live. they all seem to be making so many new friends and i just don't feel that way. i am loving college in some ways and in other ways i hate it. i really want a boyfriend. alot of my friends have been asked to all these pledge lines and i just haven't. am i ugly? am i fat? sometimes i just want to know what exactly in wrong with me. i am tired of drinking. everybody in austin is an alcoholic. it makes me feel terrible and lazy. it is fun for a while and then the next day you feel like crap. my roommates still aren't back yet from san antonio. what's wrong? my other roommate is getting in the shower. i wonder why. i wonder why bobby piper hasn't called me. he was my date a few nights ago. he was such a gentleman. i don't think we could ever date though. i am not a very good dancer. i get real nervous when i am on the dance floor. my friends from arkansas left today. i didn't go out with them last night. i read my friends paper and she was talking about how drunk she was at the time. it kind of shocked me. it was kind of funny though. i think it gives me more self-esteem when guys like me. is that horrible? diet coke is so gross. why am i drinking one right now? should i call my brother? his girlfriend is so awesome. she is one of my favorite people in the entire world. i love my brother too but he gets drunk too much. i hope he doesn't become an alcoholic. i wish people would come see me. i get kind of lonely sometimes or maybe it is that i don't want to be doing my work right now. i kind of like homework though because when i am done i get a feeling of accomplishment. that is also why i like to run. because when i am done i get a feeling of accomplishment. i am really nervous about my english paper. i don't think it is very good. i am going to rewrite it now since i gave been rambling for twenty minutes. i need to pray. i wonder if god is always listening. oh well, i'll stop now.

" today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. i sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes i feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. we aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 11th. i mean the nice safe world i lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. i didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. now, i occasionally do doubt. and most of all, thinking about the 11th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards america, i am angry at the world, at people, i don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 5 will grow up in. she is a very close part of me, i feel very close and love her very much. she's my little sis. and to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. i mean on ond hand i am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in texas far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, i will be fine. and then i get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how i am american and she is american and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. alyssa is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, i would be devistated if anything happened to her, i would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. i feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that americans have adopted. i am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as i can because i do not want her to fear life. i want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world i grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but i face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. i find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like i am alternating bewteen a world where i realize the new threats involved with iraq and the possibility of war. just recently, i started paying close attention to the news coverage of saddam hessein and his disregard to un weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. i relize the seriousness of the iraq conflict, the seriousness of the 11th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. maybe because i am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. nevertheless, i am bothered by this whole change in our world. i have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, i have plans of becoming a doctor one day and i have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. i never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. i am 20, should this much stuff be present in my life? you know, i heard amazing grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on tv tonight and was emotionally moved. that song always does that to me. it can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. i wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. that was the first song i ever played on the piano and trumpet if i am remembering correctly. i miss my parents, mostly my little sister. i am going back this weekend, but i am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because i have mcuh homework to finish. i guess thats another struggles i am dealing with in my life currently. i started thinking about how much i love my grandparents. they live right up a little path from our house in san antonio and i realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. i would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. now i rarely ever see them because i am in college. i will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time i have now to spend with them? is spending time in college worth the sacrifice i am making. why can't i spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on.

"i really have no idea what to write about. i am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. it feels like i have just been on vacation and am home now. some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but i took some allergy medicine and i have no desire to dance. the medicine makes me so tired. my dad is very upset with my cat because while i have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. she only does that when she is upset about something. i guess she misses me. we used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. she was a wonderful dog. i am bringing my fish back with me when i go back to austin tomorrow. that is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. i had to sell my horse before i left for college. i had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. i still haven't sold all of my equipment. i can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. princess diana died in a car accident this morning. i really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but i guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. anyway, i think it is really really sad. i especially feel so bad for her children. i was watching 60 minutes on tv a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. my brothers and i used to fish a lot with the family too. it is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. one of them is 22 and the other one is almost 26. that is hard to believe. i just turned 18 on friday. it was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. i am also glad i came home because that way, i can be sure that i keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. i want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. i am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. i think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. i went to camp texas at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where i used to live in houston. she told me that a girl i used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. it was so shocking and really sad. i mean, i didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since i had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. my roommate at towers is really cool. i am glad we get along. i was worried i might get some freak. i can just imagine that if i had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than i thought it would be. i think i still have a few minutes left. i think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. sometimes they are really, really loud. we used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. it was in the middle of the night and i heard her running around the house like a freak. finally i got up to see what was wrong and i took the trap off of her. the mouse appeared to be dead so i put it in a baggy but when i got up in the morning, i found out it was still alive so i tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so i put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. it finally got better so i let it go. i had to let it go far away from my house though because my mom was afraid it would come back in. my cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in houston. it was so sad. i cried everyday until we finally found her again. i think my twenty minutes is up now.

"my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from vivian. i don't want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and i have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while i was writing this i was thinking several different thoughts. i think it's not good that i don't respect vivian's wishes. i really admire her because she's so old. i am not as nice as i used to be. it's funny to think about writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. i still don't talk that much though because i don't like saying something about nothing. but i guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. james and i have been getting along really well. ever since i fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and i must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what i just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset i was, and i realized how much he cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because i don't always know what i want. then he makes it apparent that he's what i want. i miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when i have a really good person already? he makes me laugh and we love, which is most important in the person i share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and i will take it. james just has more than the average joe. oooo - i've already spent 15 minutes. i should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but i acknowledge my thoughts, and i can go back and read it in the future to see my development. i want to be a model or an actor. i want the spotlight. sometimes. i want to be a better gymnast. i don't want to be judgmental. i want a copy of this.

"so, what am i suppose to write about? i guess just anything huh. well , there are too much things for me to do this week, so many things. i have voluntary works to do, lots of school works are due by the end of the week, still lots of meetings for organizations and clubs. also i have to work too. that takes up a lot of time, it seems like everytime there's a meeting they are all bunched together on tue and weds, which i can never attend because of work. sometimes i really wonder if work is really that important that i have to make it all the time, it seems like no one really cares if you do show up or not, you just clock in and find something to do. i don't even have a real job to do yet, i've been doing a lot of different stuff, just wherever they need me. i don't even think the people there knows me at all. i'm pretty new so i guess after a while they will know me. i thought about just skipping work a couple times , but i think i better not. but after i show up to work , there's really nothing to do. they could handle the stuff without me, so then i feel like i should have just skipped work. i forot what time i started writing, i wonder how do they know how long i've been writing. oh , i just got something cool from my ra, and a call for me to go shopping and meet people, cool, so i guess i have to go even though i haven't been writing for twenty minutes, but this thing is pretty long already so i guess it won't matter that much. well, the more i look at it , it seems kinda short! well but i really have to go, what should i do??? yikes, well i wonder if i can come back later and continue to write , but i don't think that's possible because that just voids the purpose of stream of con. for 20 minutes huh. but i really have to go. so i guess i'll cheat this time. but i'll write longer on the next assignment to make it up i guess.

"well i've finally sat down to start writing this and i'm wondering where its going to go. i don't feel like i have a whole lot to say though i'm sure i'll end up babbling for the next 20 minutes. its rather cold in here. i turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold. i'm borderline shivering. i suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as i expected texas to be. feeling pretty hungry as well. i haven't eaten since about 9am. i meant to go get some dinner at kinsolving around 6pm but lost track of time and now they're closed. its really annoying how they close so early. even if i were to go eat at 7pm i'd end up hungry again before i go to bed and eating microwavable dinners doesn't prove particularly satisfying or healthy. this laptop keyboard is being a real pain as i try to type this. i'm not used to it at all because i just got this computer yesterday. my poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here, i suppose i should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark. my roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet. i'm a bit bored as it is. the whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing (poorly i might add) crappy punk songs. judging by his volume and consistency i'd venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good. unfortunately for him, and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite. oh well, i suppose that is part of dorm life. as i thought i would i've found myself making use of suppose, although, and though a little too often. i think that i think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences (like this one). i just realized i have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes. there's a paragraph break just for style points even though there aren't any of those. speaking of hurting eyes i'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile. its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear. i don't feel any eye strain so i'm hoping its a non factor. unfortunately, the fancy (but cheap) office chair i bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods. and i find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner, both for my back and neck. hopefully its something i'll adjust too. in retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea. it makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this (you). there i go with the 'although' again. its really rather annoying. my constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying. for some reason i imagine someone with a british accent saying rather everytime i type it. after i wrote those last few sentences i started thinking of pre-testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul. which then of course prompted me to wonder how one (you) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style. what does this say about me? i don't know, nor do i care. although (dammit) i would once again venture a guess and say nothing. boy time flies when you're babbling and rambling. i was hoping for some synonym there but it wouldn't come to me so i just let it go. thank god i won't be taking much in the way of english courses the next couple years. writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least. i feel a headache coming on now. probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 2 hours or so. although (i can't stop myself) i've sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects. i often wish i knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so i would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing. i recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by potassium deficiencies (i think i butchered that but i can't be bothered to figure out how to spell it). it actually works out nicely that the only fruit consistently in kinsolving is bananas although (its unbelievable really) they've been a bit over ripe the last few times i went there. well down to my last ninety seconds. if you were or are hoping for something even remotely enlightening or insightful well you're just flat out of luck. so i've managed to type random sentences here for the last twenty minutes and its worked out alright. i didn't type out the last two numbers because i didn't want to look for them on the laptop keyboard. and i'm done. yay. now for more homework.

"i don't know a lot of people in every one of my classes and that makes me nervous and anxious. i guess i also am feeling very excited too. i am away from home, from parents and rules, and away from people i know. i like familiarity. that is like a comforting thought to me. i can't stand the fact that this school is so huge that i don't even know where my next class is. all i want to do is curl up in my dorm bed and stay there. even though i don't like my bed at all because it isn't like mine at home, it will do. i am excited about the weekend that is coming up. i get to go home and see my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. i wake up every day from the day i got here to look forward to this weekend. i don't know why, but i guess i am lonesome. in addition, i didn't make the longhorn band, which was very upsetting to me. i am very upset that i didn't make it because i knew i could have. it's just that in the back of my mind, i knew that if i make longhorn band, i wouldn't be able to go home to visit as much i want to. so, i really didn't give the audition my best shot because, as much as i wanted to make it, i didn't want to just as much. no matter which way i looked at that, i guess i feel good that i didn't make it and i regret it because i wanted to make it also. that was a conflicting feeling that was bothering me too. another thing that scares me is that i made the decision to take chemistry even though i did rather poorly in high school. but something in me just wanted to take it and prove to myself that i wasn't dumb in chemistry. i just am stubborn when it comes to giving up. i can't stand it when i can't finish something or i am not good at something that i could be. maybe that's why i am so confused about the band thing. no matter what, i want to kick myself for not making it, but on the other hand, i am jumping for joy because i know i won't be as stressed out and have time to do stuff. i was in band all through high school and i guess i decided to continue in college because it was a familiar thing for me. plus, i had such a bad experience with band directors that i was rather wary of the ones here. but i made such great friends in band that i am afraid that i won't have any while i am here not in band. another thing that worries me is that everyone tells me that i will change and stuff and they say things like, ""oh, you're probably going to 6th street and party all the time. "" even as a joke, i found that very insulting. how do they know that i will change? yes, it's true that i may change, but i have rigid moral standards that were inhibited in me from the day i was born so i don't think the changes will be that drastic or horrifying. whenever anyone says that, i get really annoyed and frustrated. another major thing i worry is whether i will ever get used to the fact that i am no longer living at home with the ""comfort zone"" that i was accustomed to. i mean, i am afraid to go home and find out that people over there changed a lot too. it's troublesome to me. like chemistry. i also worry about the fact that none of the clocks run together and classes end at varying times. i am so scared to walk into a class late, making the professor mad or annoyed. that's another fear of mine that i can see happening and i worry very much about it. that is why i tend to run out of classes, even though i have plenty of time. i am the typical goody-goody that never disobeyed the parents and had many people that had high standards for. so i hope i don't let them down while i am here. no matter what, i can't help that i am who i am for others. i am the oldest of three kids and my parents always told me to set a good example for my younger siblings. if i screw up, they will too, as i was told. you have no idea what kind of pressure that is to me. i hope that i don't let anyone down, especially myself, whoever that is.

"today i went to class at 8am. i didn't want to get up at all. even though i slept by 11pm, it was really hard to wake up this morning. i do not look forward towards tuesdays and thursdays. my first class today at 8am was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful. also, when i got up there i didn't learn a bit. you know how in charlie brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah. "", the teacher's aid voice just seemed to trail away. as the class neared the end, i left early so that i could go home and catch a couple of z's before my next class which was at 11am. soon as i got home, i just fell asleep almost instantaneously. for some odd reason, i had a dream of home. maybe i do miss it more than i think. by 10:30am, i woke up to get myself prepared for the next class. i left late and arrived to class late, leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door. taking notes is such a pain in the ass, when trying to use your legs as a desk. i just sat there thinking about the repetitive information. then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example, i blanked out and started to think about what i should do when i get home (back to my dorm) and that i needed to study for a quiz the next class. after the very monotonous class was over, i head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate. i think he is feeling the same way as i do, tired, hungry, nostalgic, and lethargic. after lunch, i got prepared for my quiz. i ended up studying for 10 minutes at most. i should have studied more but i wasn't up to it. after studying a little, i watched the news and then headed for a class. i also went to that class a little late. for some reason, today has just been an ""off"" day. i think i did rather well on that quiz and the information didn't seem like it was ""out of this world. "" i guess the best way to track my feelings' thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way i felt and thought about my day. i feel like this day was pointless in some way and that i should have done something productive. it seems like i always feel like that. the only thing i've achieved today was canceling my friend's plane ticket from northwest arkansas to austin. she was coming to watch the old rivals play. i cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation. other than that i set up my new computer and caught up with the news in iraq and in california and also the hurricane in the atlantic ocean. i think i need to be motivated more. someone to tell me that i need to go do something or someone to go do something with. i guess it's because i am feeling nostalgia. back at home, i usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever. but in this new setting and the freedom, i haven't done too much. maybe i am doing more than the usual because i've finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and i'm just thinking that i need to do more. i guess it'll take me a while to get use to the college life.

"i have finally made it to college. i miss my family and friends but at the same time i am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. it's is something new. i feel confident that i will succeed here at ut, but most importantly, i want to succeed. i am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. i sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. however, each day i feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. above all i find myself missing someone back home who i have only known a short time the most. he is a wonderful person with whom i have this extraordinary mental connection. being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. it makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything they see and do someway to another person. i am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. well i guess i will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation.

"wow, my mind goes blank when someone asks me what i'm thinking. it's really strange that that guy just stopped by. he is really friendly, but kind of creepy. he just comes in and talks to everybody. it's ok, i'm the same way; i'll sit and talk to anyone. maybe i should close the door, so i won't get distracted; but then garrett won't see that i'm here when he gets back. oh well, he can knock. i'm so tired, but i don't think i can sleep tonight. it's so loud in our hall at night; i'll just have to start taking naps during the day when everyone is in class. yeah right, rest? i'm always in class; or studying. i spend more time studying than i spend in class; seems backwards. i can't wait until this weekend. need to ask professor about ahhhh namo's calling. need to go to admissions office and claim ctc credit and change major. need to ask pennebaker about experiments. hope namo stops by, i'm kinda bored. this weekend will be fun; i haven't seen friends from home in a couple of weeks, so it'll be good to hang out with them. but what about keith? i don't know how he is going to act now that we broke up. should i tell him about matt? who cares? i should call uncle david about kayaking; he really wants to go, and it will be a good stress reliever. hope i have time; good memory. i think matt would really like it too. i don't really want to go home, haven't been gone long enough. why wasn't anyone in the comp lab earlier to help me. now i'll have to go again tomorrow. it's ok, tomorrow's easy. can't wait to swim laps again; it's a good workout. i should keep lifting weights. i don't want to lose any more weight, but it would be nice to gain some muscle; i'll keep lifting weights. oh, have to meet jen tomorrow for cru. she is nice, i just don't know if i'll have time to meet in the small group regularly. that's terrible, i should never pick other things over bible study. but i pray, and i should study on my own. i hope annah starts going to church with me. texas eleven? are they still in new mexico? is that where they went? i don't think so. wow, this feels like when i'm working out and waiting for the twenty minutes to be up. i keep looking and the clock. maybe i should put on some socks; these floors are really cold, and i think they're pretty dirty too. yuck, who else has been barefoot here? where's sarah, haven't seen her today. where's my roommate? she is always here. it's ok, this is nice. i need to go to the eye doctor, because i'm having trouble focusing. glasses would be such a pain; i hope my vision gets better on its own. will i have time to take spanish every semester of college? i hope so; it would be nice to be fluent. very useful also if i work in texas. i have to stay in texas; it's too cold everywhere else. i love texas anyway. austin too. it's so great to finally live here. and home isn't too far away. i'm not homesick yet. i just want my own bed. jester beds suck. i have to be exhausted to get comfortable in them. i hope jenny takes me out again soon. i had lots of fun with her. i need to spend time with kim too. i'm so glad we've been friends for so long. even when we don't talk for a long time, she is always there. my eyes are tired. what's on tv? absolutely nothing interesting. where's matt? maybe i'll call him. no, he is with a friend. he will call later. so many books, where to start? probably spanish, i have that first. i need to stop eating so much candy. it's bad for my teeth and my body. look, time's almost up. yep, they're in new mexico, but only ten left. what's the point? who cares? does anybody pay attention anymore? did i ever? not me!

" okay, i thought right now would be the best time to do this. i'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. these last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. we got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. this is all that keeps playing over and over right now. where did we mess up? well the past is the past and you can't change it. my dad came down and was very disappointed. he didn't know i had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and i don't evne get drunk. i get a buzz and i'm good. i have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. for some reason he doesn't beleive it. he was furious. he's always trusted me for everything and never thought i'd mess up like this. i do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. i have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. i never wanted to disappoint my parents. i kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. so they would think of me as they saw me everyday. this last senior year i started going to parties and hanging out with different people. i'm a real easy going person. the way i think is that i don't care aobut anything. i let things happen. i make the decisions that i think are right at the time and let whatever happen. i like to make people happy. i'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something i let them argue and win. if they think they are right than they feel good. as for me i don't care. i know i'm right or wrong and i let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. so aobut the drinknig i have no idea what lead me to it. i used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. everyone liked me but i never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because i was the only indian at my school and i was easy gonig and friendly. i hate no one, i think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. once someone screws me over than i don't like them but until then i try to get along with everyone. well i guess that's why i staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. very bad excuse, i know. my dad thinks it's peer pressure. peer pressure has never gotten to me i odn't think. i have a strong will about serious things. if i think it's bad and will do something to me i don't like than i won't do it. i tried weed too because i wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. i tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and i have astma so i decdie that wasn't for me. i never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. so so i decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times i liked the feeling. it was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. my mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. my mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. i would hate that. my dad i don't know. as i sit here thikngi aobut him i feel more and mroe sorry. he came yesterday and gave me a lecture and i said i wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because i couldn't be sincere i thought it was bullshit. a few drinks every now and then can't hurt. well i know it can but still it's weird i don't know how to explain. well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. me and my dad rarely talk i talk to my mom aobut my problems, so i got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if i was still going to dirnk and if i had done any other drugs. he doesn't trust me me anymore. that hurts the worst. i'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because i l;iek to think things thorugh. right now i feel very guilty. i totally blew my dad off this afternoon and i saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. i guess i get it from him. it's weird. so now i'mthinkngi aobut how i can make it up. i got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. we tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. but somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. my dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. she said i sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. for some reason i still lsiten ot her so i'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that i'm going to stop drinknig. i really do want to stop now. i know i can stop if i put my mind to it. i don't need alcohol anymore. one night can ruin the next 6 years haha. it's crazy

" i am very, very tired. i have not been getting enough sleep, i wake up too early for my eight o clock math classes, and i can never seem to go to bed earlier than 2 in the morning. i want to go to bed earlier, but for some reason i just can not. maybe part of the problem is that i am addicted to diet dr. pepper, and i even drink them late at night. it is probally the caffeine that is keeping me up. i am also feeling extremely stressed out at the moment. i went through rush and became a pledge in a sorority that i love. i went through the whole process by my self. unlike many other girls, my parents did not really help me, or even want me to. now that i have become a member, we are accpted to pay a lot of money and my parents are telling me we do not have it. it is extremely frusterating because they are being complety unsupportive. i told them that i would get a job and they said that if my grades suffered then i would have to quit the sorority and the job, but since they are not offering to pay much money towards it, what exactly is it that they want me to do?? i am also extremely frusterated that i do not have a computer yet. i am in the college of education, and i ordered an ibook from the ut computer store. when i placed the order, they told me it would take up to two weeks for the computer to be in. it has been a week and a half so far. i called the store today and the lady was extremely rude and said that it usually takes three weeks for a customer to receive their product. i am using my roomate's computer at the moment, and although she says that she does not mind, i feel bad constantly using it, and i would just be more comfortable if i had my own. i also feel sick. i have had a sore and extremely scratchy throat for what feels like weeks now. i never seem to get better. one day i might feel a little more lively and energetic but the next day i will just feel worse. you know, i am usually not this pessimistic. in fact i am proud of the fact that i am so optimistic, however at this moment, right now, i just have a lot of problems and a lot of stuff to be upset about. the whole cost of my sorority is really stressing me out. i know that my parents want me to quit, they were hinting at it on the phone last night, but i just do not want to. it is something that i have gone through, and it is something that i enjoy. i am the first person on either side of my family to have joined either a sorority or a fraternity, and i would like to uphold this. i would like to prove to them that their is nothing wrong with it. my family can sometimes be close minded and i would like to be the first one to open up their mind on this idea. lets see, so i don't sound like a depressed, basket case, let me think of the positive aspects in my life right now. to begin, i absolutely and completely am in love with college. i love my dorm, i like my roomates and my suitemates and all of the people that live in my hall. i have already established some awesome friendships and i know that as the year progresses, they will only blossom. i like my classes. i mean school is school, but the classes i am taking are somewhat interesting to me, and i do not really mind studying these subjects. i am in the college of education; i want to be an elementary school teacher, and i am very much looking foward to that. i can not wait to begin working with children. i love kids. i would like to have four someday. preferabally two girls and two boys, but it is not like i would not be happy with whatever i get. i am from austin, and my parents and my two younger sisters live about fifteen minutes away. i have not seem my family all that much since i have moved in because i am trying to get the full college experience of going away. i almost decided against ut because i thought it was to close to home, but now i am so glad that i came here. however, the point of this was, i am not homesick because i have lived in austin for the last 5 years. it is cool though because i never spent much time down on campus, so it is almost like i am in a new city. the guy that lives down the hall laughs at me because i am so bad with directions and do now know where the closest wal-mart of heb are from our dorm. but i always tell him that it is because i am not from this part, i mean i just do not know this whole downtown'campus area of austin very well. i am very excited because today i am beginning my diet and new excerise plan. following a diet and watching myself lose weight always makes me feel better about my self. these are just some of my thoughts and feelings at this moment.

" well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at wendy's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 5 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a hosa meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend rakhi at texas a&m. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and im guessing its most probably amit because it said unknown for the caller id which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. also i am really use to pushing ctrl s and i can't really do that here because i am not writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 90% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 7 minutes. i thought because of what monique said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 2 o' clock today. once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like awwww i love you in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and arpan called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone! well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a greyhound ticket to a&m costs since i would love to go there. well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my mis homework, chek the emails from dell, check out the sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some eco, go over eco notes, read some philosophy, and the philosophy book, read the beginning of the psychology book, and finish chapter 1 of mis, and finish reading developing you into me of ba101. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 2 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. besides all that, sid, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 9 playing for free at the union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is friday and now the phone just rang and now 20 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later ",0,0.307987 -0.637944 -0.518036 -0.990006 -0.973591 0.622234 -0.081376 -0.822017 -0.295483 0.700802 -0.028735 -0.590446 -0.985943 0.52128 -0.278657 0.0 -0.04277 -0.136646 0.264294 -0.607437 0.115273 -0.01144 -0.370872 -1.439902 -0.624052 0.196727 0.298682 0.23232 -2.028989 -1.18865 0.008325 -0.348185 -1.64289 -0.906028 -0.572162 -0.81324 1.738636 1.82616 1.36726 -0.448258 -0.142311 1.774874 -1.100426 0.829293 1.356608 0.129304 -0.371517 -0.486898 1.571024 -0.55631 -1.34699 0.681048 1.445349 -0.277928 -0.864375 -0.612905 0.001441 0.047807 0.091545 0.810637 0.290982 -0.173738 -0.480161 0.222651 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.915851 -0.454784 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.22441 0.846335 -0.422267 -0.832849 -0.451544 0.227862 -1.092711 4.840273 3.560288 4.636396 4.832407 4.381388,1628
"well, i today i'm feeling pretty lovely. i woke up this morning and went to the gym. afterwards i took a shower and went downstairs to get something to eat. i met up with this boy i am talking to, he's really sweet and sexy. he makes me feel special. but i'm being very cautious in this little relationship, because i tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, and i don't feel like getting hurt. anyways, my sandwich was really good. i'm also watching seinfeld right now. actually if you want to be technical with it, i'm not watching it because i'm typing right now, but it's on in the background. but yah, i love seinfeld. i think it's the greatest show in the world. i am still amazed at how someone can write a nine season show about nothing. that's crazy. you know what else i think is crazy? i don't know how in world i'm going to manage my time between classes and work-study and the gym and my social life. it's like there is so much to do. especially with all this reading i have to do for psy. now that's crazy! why do we have to read so much. why can't the teacher just teach it to us. maybe i'm just being lazy. who knows? yes! another episode of seinfeld is coming on. anyways, on monday there's a seinfeld marathon. it starts at 7am until the end of labor day. that is really cool. i can't wait. but yah. i wonder what grade i'm going to get in this class. i've done all my experiments. i be damned if i had to write some 5 page psychological paper. so you know i got started on those experiments asap. okay! anyways, i really don't know what else to write about. so lets see. let me think. what else can i talk about. oh yeah! there's a football game tonight. i hope we win. i wish i could go, but i didn't but any tickets. i don't even know where to buy tickets from. i should of just got a sports package. that would of made my life a whole lot easier. i have this football player in my class. actually he's in two of my classes. he's nice. we study together, because our rhetoric class is kind of difficult, and he's always falling asleep in class. i don't blame him. they work those football players really hard. a little bit too hard. that's just ridiculous. sometimes i feel for them, because like how do they expect them to do good in school, when there only getting like 5hrs of sleep a day. that's not good, especially with all that strenuous activity they do. i know i wouldn't be able to do it. i know after i come back from the gym, i'm ready to go back to sleep. so i really feel for the football players. but i guess if you really want to make it to the nfl, you got do it. you got to stick with it. and that really goes for anything. if you want to accomplish any of your goals, then you have to stick with the game plan. anyway, you know it really hasn't hit me that i am in college yet. i mean it kind of hit me last week, when i was going out with some of my friends. and it was like, i don't have to call my mom and tell her what i'm doing, i don't have to worry about her sending out a search party for me. i don't have to answer to nobody. it's so great. i love this! anyway, the way i see it if i just find out some way to manage my time with work, gym, classes, and my social life then everything should just work out fine. yah in a perfect world. anyways, looks like i got about 4 more minutes to right. okay lets, see. you know what my favorite episode of seinfeld is? the very first episode, when jerry and george where doing laundry. that's a really good episode. i know like every word, scene, move. everything about that episode. anyways, looks like i'm going on only two minutes left. two minutes and forty seconds. two minutes and 30 seconds. two minutes and 20 seconds. two minutes and 10 seconds. two minutes and now we have one minute left. all right i'm on a roll here. lets see, i guess i'll just sign off now. well this has been really fun. i hope whoever is reading this has enjoyed reading this. have a great day and a great like. 5 seconds left . and good bye!

"this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio, texas. i went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell i'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. however, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished. i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order. at first when i went to the co-op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i didn't need about three of them. so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed, and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but i still managed to have a great time. i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home. i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. we went out to eat and to see a movie. we weren't sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. i can't wait for winter time. it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. one of the worst times i've ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and i smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. all together i would have to say that i'm very excited about this year, and i can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life.

"tired, stressed, already sick of school and it has only been the first week. what can i say other than i have to do great this semester. i never knew that school would be this stressful. there are so many things going on in my life right now that i really do not have time for. i feel like my brain is on overload and don't know when i am going to get all of this stuff done. hungry, what can i say, i am always craving something. i am sitting in my dorm room all alone because my friends have all gone out to this sig ep party and i opted to stay home and catch up on things that i need to get done. i hate typing too. although typing is a lot easier to do because it is a lot faster. i just hate it when i mess up and hit the wrong key. it really irritates me when my phone rings late at night and it is one of my friends from home and you can't understand a word they are saying because they have been out partying all night long. have you ever noticed that when people have had a little too much to drink that they get real emotional? when i returned home last night from being out, one of my friends from home was hysterically crying over something a guy said to her at a party. he commented on what she was wearing and obviously she took it the wrong way and got mad. of course i knew it was no big deal, but she really thought it was. this morning, of course, she ran into my room wondering what had happened last night and why she got upset. it was such a big deal last night, but this morning she was so embarrassed. i have done the same thing that she did. gosh, i miss my parents and i never really thought that i would. my senior year i was so tired of the high school scene. i think i was the only one of my friends that hated my senior year. well, i can't say that i absolutely hated it, but i was ready to go on to bigger and better things. my boyfriend lived here, so maybe that's why i wanted to leave home so badly. my phone bill is going to be so high this semester. i talk to all of my friends so much on the phone. i also talk to my parents a lot too. i especially talk to my mom. i was always so close to my mom and it is hard to be away from her. i could always drive home one weekend. it is not very far away. i just found out today that we are going to have to go to ten hours of study hall every week. it sounds bad, but i really think this is good for me especially coming into my freshman year and trying to get adjusted to this new life that i am leading now. i was always independent, but now i feel that i am on my own for good. i really like only depending on myself for things.

"this is my first year here at the university of texas and i am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. it is so hard for me because i have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. i have to find a job because i need to be able to pay my bills and i still have so much school work that i have to keep up with. at the junior college i attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. here everything is done over the computer which i guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but i just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. i miss my family, especially my sister. i moved here by myself and i really don't know anybody here in austin. i've never had to do so much walking in my life! i guess i should get all the exercise that i need walking back and forth to my classes. i'm worried that i won't be able to keep up in classes. i think i'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and i'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. i just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. twenty minutes is a long time to write. i never thought i would feel pressured to think. i guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. i still have ten more minutes to write. i wonder how these will be graded. i have so much to do today. i need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, i have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and i have a test i have to start studying for. i hope the test won't be too difficult. i always worry about the first tests in a class. they pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. if you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. i wish that all teachers would do a review. reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because i end up going over it again and again. i guess its really repetition that makes me learn. man, i still have five more minutes to write. i have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. i was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. i bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. there must be so many distractions for the professor because i know i get distracted just sitting there. in an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. i think that i'm going to like this class. it seems like it will be interesting and fun. i think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 4. 0 students walking down the street. my finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least.

"i do not know what to write about for twenty minutes. it took me so long to get a computer at this place, and i would like to e-mail my best friend in arizona since i never get to see her. well, i guess this is the coolest assignment that i have had so far since it doesn't require any thinking- well, it actually does. in fact, that's all this assignment is about. but, i mean it is not hard. i am really worried about my classes this semester. i feel like i have been going to school here for a while, but it has only been a week. i have a lot of reading to do. i think my classes are not too hard, but i know that they will get harder, i just hope that i do well. oops, i just turned the caps lock key, sorry! well, i am now thinking about what i should eat for dinner. i am also thinking that i don't want to gain the freshman-15. i eat pretty healthy food in the cafeteria, but i eat a lot more than i did at home. but i guess since all of my classes are miles away from each other, i will be ok. my boyfriend is coming to see me sometime soon, i wish that he was here right now. i hope that he is doing ok because i wonder about him. he's always changing his mind about our whole relationship- whether he thinks it will work out or not. one minute, he is all for it, and another, he thinks it will never work because we are too far away from each other. anyway, all i know is that i really care about him, and that i have to leave the rest up to god to figure out. i feel really exhausted right now because i only got 6 hours of sleep last night, and then i woke up and went to class after a cup of coffee, something i think i'll have to get used to drinking now that i am here. that's one thing i really miss about college station, though (even though there can't possibly be that much to miss in a town like that except for the people) i miss the java shakes i used to get at sweet eugene's, this coffee house i love so much. i thought that by coming to austin, i would surely find a replacement for the java shake, with all of the many coffee houses here, but i have yet to find something to beat it. although i did find this shake called a ""skinny banana espresso shake"" at a coffee house on the drag called metro. my really good friend maria and i go there every friday now to get one- it's like one of our new little austin rituals, so we can make sure to stay close by seeing each other once in a while, and making an outing of it. it's really weird though how people you least expect to get so close to, you end up not being able to live without seeing! maria and i haven't ever been this close, but lately, we have so much in common. i just hope this isn't one of those ""since you're from my hometown, let's be best friends until i meet some other people"" kind of thing. ok i have about six minutes left, this is actually pretty cool, getting to know how my mind works and all. i already realize how many different topics my mind changes to in just 20 short minutes. i wish my mind did not wander off so many times, because that's really not good for my grades. like sometimes in class, i will sit there thinking of my boyfriend instead of listening. but, then i go back to paying attention until i start wondering how my dog is doing all alone at home. well, actually, i haven't thought about my dog during a class yet, but it could happen. besides, i wanted to bring her up in some way in this little writing experiment, and that was the best way that i could think of. anyway, as i was saying, i really hope that my dog does not die early since it is do lonely right now. my mom says she just sits on the staircase waiting for somebody to come home- that would be me or my brother. ok, now i am thinking about me brother, who is the sweetest guy on earth. i hope that he is doing ok right now. i thought that now that we live in the same city and all, we would actually get to see each other more, but we are so busy, i really don't get to see him until the weekends. anyway, i don't know what i would do if he wasn't here to help me out. for example, i wouldn't have even known about this big computer lab. well, i am sure that i would have found out somehow, but i didn't have to find out myself. i mean, i don't want to be all dependent on him or anything, but i learn a lot from him, and i learn a lot on my own, too. well, i think that my twenty minutes are up now. so maybe i will submit this and e-mail my friend jimena. or, maybe i won't.

"well, i suppose i should think of a topic to write for 20 minutes. it is a mystery to what kind of issue or topic the professor wishes me to explore. i know he says to just type what i think, but the topic is so broad there are an infinite number of paths and possibilities to explore. what exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment. it can't be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 20 minutes. my mind currently draws a blank at what i should write about. perhaps my first impressions of college as a freshman? well so far, i think i'm still getting used to the fact that i am living on my own, and i do have a greater sense of independence from my parents. however, there are responsibilities i like and dislike having. wow, it's only been around 5 minutes since i started. i really doubt i am capable of typing about no specific topic for a whole 20 minutes. now i am thinking if i am required to type for the whole 20 minutes, or if i can simply hit the finish button when i have finished this stream of thought. earlier, i started to complete a few experiment requirements. the prescreening requirement was not available, which is kind of depressing since it seemed like an easy 1. 5 hr worth of experimental credit. i hope it becomes available later. now, my mind continues to draw a blank with nothing to write about. honestly, i'm watching tv while typing this assignment, hoping to pass the time a little faster. it doesn't seem to be helping much though. it's strange when you try to force yourself to type about anything, nothing comes out. not just nothing good, but absolutely nothing! well i'm nearing the 15 min mark, and i seem to have less and less to write. i wonder how long other people's assignments will be. perhaps most will be longer than mine, but maybe not. some soul must be just as stuck as i am.

"realizing that i am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. everyday, i open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and i have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. i have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now i posses all these things. and as excited as i am, i also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. not in myself or my actions but in all i have left behind. yes i am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but i am also talking about my childhood and innocence. ok, go with me for a little bit--- i know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. i am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. i don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. my teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. all those thing that i took for granted but were a daily part of my life. don't get me wrong, i love the freedom of college and the fact that i can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call my mom if i happen to skip class. i really don't know where i'm going with this, all i can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. it's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. i am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so i don't oversleep. yet, i should confess that so far, i am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. one thing i certainly enjoy is the fact that i can spend more time with my friends and i can go out on weekdays and i can eat unhealthy food as much as i want. not to say that i indulge myself in such activities constantly. i guess the point of it all, is that i am confused. i am trying to find out who i am. and i think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, i think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.

"well, i have to confess, this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do. i am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as i go. i hear tv in the next room. my mom is in the kitchen and watching the republican national convention. i really should be watching it you because you see i'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now). however, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention. there now talking about kerry not being a good leader but the ac which is located next to my room has just come on and now i can't hear. wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what i'm thinking. it's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain is thinking. ah, pancakes are ready. i would like to go eat them now but i'm stuck here for another 9 minutes and 43 seconds. ooppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder. no pancakes i guess. i went to the phantom of the opera last semester. it was a broadway production and vg. i have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why i bring it up. i was depressing though, for all the talent and wonderful set changes. do you like the sound of the ac. i do. i don't know why but it comforts me. i think the reason it does is because when i was younger the ac would come and there was a vent right over my bed so to keep warm i would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and i like to snuggle. that was a run on sentence but that's how i think, in run ons, so i'm just trying to be accurate. i had to look up how to spell sentence. yes, i know that's horrible, but you see i'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very hard for me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels. like in the word sentence, i'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence. another example is that i used to spell ""they"" ""they"" because the e sounded like a long a to me. i better fix that if i'm going into government.

"it is late, and i know i should have started this earlier tonight, but i procrastinate. i wonder if the perfect guy for me is out there somewhere and thinking about me right now and i do not even know. i just put to rest my last relationship. too bad i messed things up with a great guy for a guy who treats me badly even though i love the guy who treats me badly. i hate that he is in my head every day, every minute. i tell people i have put him out of my life, but is he really? every time i say that he comes back into my life and i love him even more than i did the time before. i hope that god is up there on his thrown writing down in my life book that i will meet my perfect mate tomorrow and when i do i will just know that he is the one for me. i would get married at a young age if it was the right guy and he asked me to marry him. i hate when my stepmother tells me i should wait until i have lived alone for a few years before i get married. just because that is what she did does not mean that it is what i should do. every person is different and i should follow my heart. i'm quite scared though because my mom did not have good luck with finding a wonderful man to share her life with. i mean, my dad cheated on her and my stepfather beat her. i hope it is not genetic. i don't know if i am willing to stand out in the heat tomorrow and thursday to draw for football tickets. i want to see the ou game, but i really want to see it from the comforts of my home. plus, i do not have a date and everyone else will and i will feel out of place. my roommate is with her boyfriend. i am jealous of her because she has a great boyfriend and i want one too. i spotted this goodlooking guy in my philosophy discussion group and i would like to get to know him more. i have emailed him though and he hasn't emailed me back. i think that i saw him tonight while i was walking down the street, but i did not want to stare, so i could not get a very good look. i am looking forward to getting married and waking up in the same arms every morning. i even have everything for my perfect wedding planned out. i want to get married on the same day my grandparents did and i want to have a big orchestra playing my favorite slow songs. i wish that i would be walking down the aisle to ryan, but he does not want me. if he did i would be the happiest girl in the world. he makes me feel like a princess when i am with him and he is treating me right. i only wish that one day he will open his eyes and realize what he gave up because he said he wanted to be ""free"". i guess i did mess things up with him though because i lied to another guy. i was just so confused this summer and i did not know what i wanted if i could not have ryan. he would be my first choice over any guy in the world and it should not be like that because he hurts me so many times too. i just loved being with him. i wondered if my grandparents knew that they would be together for so long when they were married fiftyseven years ago. i think that is so special and i would thank god every day if i had that same thing happen to me. i am thirsty, but i am too lazy to get up right now. i hope that i can get my two friends together soon. it is weird that the guy that is like my brother now is the first boy i ever kissed. it was so long ago though. who would have thought that he and i would be so close now that it would be like we were brother and sister?

"well, today is my second day as a freshmen at ut. my fist class was at 9:30 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. i thought i wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly i understood him very well and i understood what he was talking about. it was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. i guess i really did learn something last year in calculus. i did have a really good teacher and i did well on the calc ap exam. i have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. he was the coolest. he was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. i understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. i wish i had teachers like him in other subjects i took in hs. m economics teacher was not to good. it was an ap course too and i really felt that i didn't learn much. now i'm going to take an economics class in college. i hope i get the same relaxed feeling as in my business calculus class. the professor seems pretty cool. and maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. either way i'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so i can eventually do well. if there's one thing i learned in high school, it's to stick with it. starting out in high school, all i wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. but at the end i started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. in the end i will get a good grade trough all the hard work i put forth and then i can have that satisfied feeling that i did good and all my work paid off, so i must continue it. so i got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. i usually get to see those results i so desperately work for but if not i work even harder the next time so i can finally see the results i was looking for. my high school was extremely competitive and i managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. i'm very proud of myself, and where i am today. many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. in fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where i just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the ut business school. already i've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. that makes me feel so proud and honored for the position i am in. other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. again, i realize how lucky i am. i can't see myself majoring in anything else besides business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. psychology was my second choice for a major. i was that close to being a psychology major. so, now i know it was meant to be. i've had an accounting internship already, and i 'v e been to numerous business programs, which i have enjoyed very much. it brings me so much joy to say that i just may have found my niche because i know that this major includes all things that i enjoy.

"geez, i'm trying to think about what i'm supposed to write about for 20 minutes. this is weird. i wonder if people use this assignment as a dear diary"" thing. i wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments. that would be a lot of reading to do. how can they read so much? i get so tired of reading all the time. i want to have fun. instead of having fun though, i'm always stuck in my room reading all the time. i hate reading. school reading isn't fun. text book reading that is. i don't like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry. why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems. no one reads the text book crap. i don't even understand why some classes have certain books. hm. i just don't like reading. i think this means that i'm going to have problems in college later on. everyone always tells me that when you're in college, you have to have the patience to read everything. if what i read what actually interesting, i wouldn't have a problem. hmm, well i remember in english in high school, a lot of the books that we read were really interesting. i liked lord of the flies and anthem, and the scarlett letter. those were really cool books. the bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze every single thing! i hated analyzing. i mean, analyzing is important, but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff. i remember on the scarlett letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green. what the hell was that all about? i don't' get it! there are some things that don't really need explaining. they're just fact. how can you explain fact? seriously, i think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head. i think they're trying to teach us something on that. how well you can come up with some explanation in a split second. actually, i guess that can come in handy. like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late. you wouldn't get a ""good grade"" if your reasoning wasn't valid enough. hmm. i don't know. some teachers are cool. i miss my teachers back at home. i miss mr. fred, he was such an awesome teacher. i somewhat liked calculus because of him. he had a weird personality. that's what made him cool. i also miss mrs. conrey. she was fun to talk to too. i miss our little group in bio2. that was my favorite class! i loved hanging out with the gang. geez, i can't believe that time is gone. life went by so fast. i wish i could go back and relive some moments. not to change them. but to feel that kind of happiness again. now, everyone is so concerned with getting to know new people. i mean, i don't mind getting to know new people but not everyone likes the whole ""hi, my name's rebekah, what's yours?"". i think certain people would get really annoyed by that. geez, there are so many people in this school, it's not even funny. i miss knowing everyone you pass by. it's kinda like that cheers song. ""where everybody knows your name. dum da da dum. and they're always glad you came. dum da da dum. "" i love that show. hehe, it's great. geez, life passes by way too quickly. it's kinda funny to think about how that was the ""seinfeld"" or ""friends"" during that decade. hehe, but it's still funny. it's funny how people don't like watching those old shows anymore. i don't care how old they are. if they're funny, they're funny. that's all that matters. it gets annoying how everyone puts up with the same friends reruns. it's so annoying. but still a great show. i remember when a new season would start, everyone would say ""ohh, this is the last season!"". the last season is finally here. i mean the show is still really funny and all. but come on. everyone knows that it was getting really old. everyone's hooking up with someone else. it's kinda annoying but kinda cute how that worked out. but i think it's wrong how joey hooks up with rachel. i'm sorry but ross and rachel belong to only each other. it's wrong to see them not together. i really hate how they're not married on the show. dude, you shouldn't have a kid unless you're married. you're just asking for your kid to have problems if you're not. what the hell is this all about how girls have sex b'4 marriage. i think it's so stupid! what the hell happened to good morals and traditions? now everyone's a whore. that's so disgusting. how can you share yourself with everyone you see? grr, people annoy me.

"well, here i go writing a stream of consciousness. i am starving right now. all i have eaten today are cookies and queso with chips. the timer clock at the top of this page is bothering me, i don't know why, but it is distracting me from writing. my boyfriend is going to his ranch tomorrow. i wish he did not go every weekend because it sucks for me to be here without him. the electric bill is so expensive that we received today. i am out of money. well not out, but out of money that i can spend on random stuff. i miss my mom. i hope my grandpa is doing ok, he is very very sick. my eyes hurt. i don't like wearing my glasses. the fan is also irritating them. i am glad that its the weekend. i want a cool front to come through. i am so tired of being hot outside at school. i think i have a obsession with correct spelling. i know that this is supposed to be informal, but i cannot let a misspelled word go uncorrected. capitalization does not bother me, however, nor does some punctuation. i am the same way when i type online to my friends. i wonder if that means anything significant. probably not. i want a dog. i wish i lived in a complex that allowed pets. next year i will get one, hopefully. i want to adopt one from the spca or the pound. they are just as nice as ones from breeders, as well as cheaper, and they need a home more than the others. geez, this timer makes the time seem to go by more slowly. its like that saying my mom always says, 'a watched pot never boils. ' similar at least. i want a good book to read. i hate how i have so much reading homework from my classes that i do not have time to read for pleasure. oh well, maybe i'll find the time once i get more settled in to the routine of school. i need to do laundry. i have no clean clothes to wear, and i dropped grape jelly on my favorite jeans yesterday. i hope that it does not stain. i don't know what to day now. its so weird, i know that the brain never stops working, but if you try to identify your thoughts sometimes you draw a blank. its like you caught your mind off-guard. like when your boyfriend asks you what you're thinking about, and its really only what you had for lunch that day, but he is expecting something more romantic than that because he thinks he is being romantic and sincere by asking the question. so maybe when you have to say immediately what you are thinking at that moment and you don't have an answer, maybe your subconscious is just embarrassed because it was just thinking about something insignificant. ok, that whole little tangent probably made no sense to anybody except myself. oh well. i am tired of typing. my hands are out of shape. how sad. my whole body is out of shape. i hate living on the third floor of my apartment complex. the stairs are killing me. i didn't realize how out of shape i was until i had to move in and carry all my stuff up a million flights of stairs. my chair is too low and i can't figure out how to make it go up higher because there aren't any knobs or levers. its hurting my wrists. well, my right wrist to be specific. i hate it when people have something they want to say and they just don't know how to be direct about it. 'beating around the bush' that is so annoying. just get the words out. mmmm. i am so hungry. i want a burrito. or some queso. or both at the same time. i love mexican food. its good stuff. i would like a margarita too. that would be nice. i hope that i can transfer into the college of communications. that would be awesome. i hope that i succeed in advertising. i think that i would do a good job, but there are so many good and creative people at ut, all wanting to do the same thing as me. i hope that i have a fighting chance. i know that i have the work ethic to do well, but as far as creativity, i am uncertain if i measure up to the industry standard. wow, the time is up. that went by fast.

"my parents just dropped me off at my dorm room and they are headed home to houston. they came up for the football game and to see me. my mom calls me every day, whether it be to see if i'm up for school or if just to see what i'm doing for the day. gosh, i'm starving right now and my friend just ate all of his taco bell. i wish he would have saved some for me. when i get done typing i'm going to go find some grub. oh, speaking of food, this morning i ate an awesome breakfast buffet at the double tree with my parents. i just got a computer; i don't know why i'm using my friend, matt's, computer. his roommate just picked up the phone and disconnected me. but, luckily i got right back on. i have so much reading to do today for philosophy, chemistry, and nutrition. i hope it doesn't take too long because i'm so tiered and i want to take a nap. every time i wake up from sleeping i feel as though i'm getting more and more sick. i'm on different medications for my asthma, allergies, and my congestion. the good thing is that i have a doctor's appt. on friday. so hopefully i can hang in 'til then. i met a girl that lives down the hall from me named jenny when i moved in my dorm and it turns out that we long lost sisters. well, not really, but we do have absolutely everything in common. it really is weird how alike we are. i feel so lazy staying in side studying on a sunny sunday afternoon. i would love to go swimming right now. i hope that this writing assignment gets to janel seagal or whomever it is supposed to go to. well, it's over and i'm off to eat!! good-bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

" i've been thinking about relationships lately. as we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. this new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. it's something new and i like it, but i can't help but still have feelings for my ex. i think the reason is because i was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. and i think that keeps me tied to her in a way. and the problem is when i'm with this new girl, i'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason i can not get aroused, if you nkow what i mean. it's not that i don't want to, because i do, but for some reason i'm just not able to. i wonder why this is? why can't i just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. is it me? what can i do to fix the problem? should i just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? or will this be a chronic thing? im in a bind because i don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. i don't want her to think i'm not attracted to her. god, i can't wait to see her! she lives in dallas still, she's a year younger, so i can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. and she has already taken advantage of me when i was drunk. should i tell this new girl this? what good would it do? i'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me i definitley wouldn't lie to her. when i broke up with my ex i wanted to be free, i mean i was going to college and i wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. but then just a week after we broke up, i found her!! and she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. she likes me how i am, but i like to try and impress her as much as i can. i find myself spending a lot of moeny on her! plus, i'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but i definitley want it for her because i know she would like to see me with more muscles. she's so beautiful! her face pops up in my head everyday. i see her face on everyone i meet! am i in love again? i hope not. i don't want to fall in love with someone i can't be with do to where we live. that would hurt too much. i have to be close to the person i love. so i will not let myself fall in love again. i can't let it happen. but i'm afraid it will, i know she is falling in love with me, but i got to hold back. i got to be strong. i can't wait till i go back in town in october. i'm taking her out to a haunted house, i love them , she hates them. meaning she will be clinging to me like white on bread. i love when she puts her arms around me. i love when we're fooling around she takes my shirt off. she's very aggressive. . . god i love that. an aggressive woman is very attractive in my eyes, a woman who will take control is somethign rare, and she posesses it. i so want to get more physical with her, but i'm afraid because you see, she's a virgin. . . i'm not. i don't want to steal her innocence. she's so sweet and innocent, i don't want to corrupt that, especially when i don't know if there is a definite future for she and i. what do i do? i think she wants to have sex because of all the signals she gives me when we're fooling around but i'm not too sure. do i go ahead and go for it? or will that just make me fall in love with her, which i stated before i didn't want to do. man, she makes me so jealous! i have never been jealous, but for some reason she makes me. i guess it might be because i'm not there with her, and i know she hangs out with all these guys, and osmetimes its just her and a guy. that pisses me off, i mean i trust her, but one of the guys she hangs out with is an ex-boyfriend of hers, who makes it very clear that he is still madly in love with her. so how am i suppsoe to take that? god!! i wish i wasn't jealous, i mean she and i are just dating and i'm already this jealous. i was never this jealous in my entire previous relationship. she makes me so happy though. she can do nothing wrong! she is my everything and i think about her constantly! i think i love her!

"right now i am thinking about the point of this i guess maybe it does have some point but i really don't see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment i mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes. my dorm room is rather hot and i want to get up to turn our fan on but i won't because then i would have to leave the computer and then i couldn't track my thoughts for those few second that i leave the computer. i waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 9:45 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me i also notice that i have only been typing for like 2 minutes. i wonder what i'm going to be typing for 18 more minutes. gosh i have some much to do tonight i have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and i have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then i have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. i don't really like my biology class but i do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and i've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . i hope i don't have an ear infection. i feel like i'm starting to get a headache maybe its because i'm tired or maybe because i'm hungry . or maybe because i'm dehydrated. i dunno but once this is over i think i'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what i'm thinking of . i've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why i have a headache . who knows . but i can't wait till i get to go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these i bet these can get really interesting i mean if i had to read over 500 of these i'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating? i'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . i have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. i wish i could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 12 minutes . this is crazy . after this i have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because i know that i'll be tired and i won't feel like doing it an then i'll tell myself that i'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what i need to do but it won't happen . gosh i'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but i think it might be from my jaw and that probably why i have a headache . gosh i really could go for a massage right about now but i don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . i doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm i don't know if i like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that i will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when i close them i want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well i only have like a minute left count down . 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 5049484746454443424140393837363534333231302928272625242 ah nice its over ",1,-0.295478 -0.533078 -0.169951 -1.26518 -1.069764 0.117458 -0.189884 -0.462557 -0.526034 0.462243 -0.078579 0.109369 -1.12159 -0.059531 -0.191613 0.0 -0.04277 -0.147445 0.363271 -0.186485 0.33306 -0.150675 -0.537285 -0.975907 -0.624052 -0.738939 -1.189028 1.352788 -0.62217 -1.070272 -1.100231 0.322029 0.278656 -0.552174 -0.777375 0.168988 0.52452 0.612002 -0.482954 0.686615 0.412585 1.600926 -1.856695 0.950918 1.03091 0.71312 0.205271 -0.753434 0.011179 -0.725827 -0.276149 -0.083197 -0.633399 0.306702 -0.256571 -1.219098 -0.288711 -0.413468 -0.137999 0.425784 -0.828584 -1.086943 -0.480161 -0.396986 0.14586 0.825708 -0.086094 -0.710829 -1.180456 0.050358 -0.23436 -0.138324 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.294279 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.078844 4.651374 3.8265 4.643554 4.571837 4.284689,1982
"ok. stream of. ""come as you are. i wonder if anybody actually misses kurt cobain. ""no i don't have a gun""? what? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named nirvana, whose leader shot himself. blues traveler, much better group. i wonder how many people have killed themselves because of kurt cobains death. that takes intelligence. kurt's dead, life's not worth living. why did i wait till the day before this is due to type it. ohhhhhh i love this song. it reminds me of my boyfriend and i. ""when she says she loves me"". except i don't say i love him because according to every one of my friends i'm afraid to tell him i love him. something about a fear of commitment and love. i guess it's all supposed to be nathan's fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. "" when she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love"". good song. i wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. oh yah, classic sting. i have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. i never really liked sting anyway. i should really be doing my other homework. what do i have to do? english paper, read my classic civilization, read my english, study psy notes, and phl notes. i guess i can do most of it tomorrow. third eye blind. where do they get names for these groups? tomorrow is another day{go scarlett}. i really don't want to go to work tomorrow. at least i have a decent boss for once, not some 57 year old pervert. what time is it? wow 15 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. i wish they were all that easy. yah right. that probably wouldn't get me into med school. medical school, four more years of college. hopefully i can get through these first four. i can do it, because i'm good enough i'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. well it's been a great 14 min. i'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. i need to do these more than a day before their due next time.

"it seems like everyone has gone home for labor day weekend. lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. we had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. i really don't normally like mashed potatoes but i always just get them anyway. a couple people started playing coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. the more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. this dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. at night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. they tend to yell and be extremely loud. our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. it would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. there are so many more months before the semester is over! i'm sure it will go quickly though. twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. i still have to go to wal-mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. i'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. i've been watching way too much of ""the real world"" in the past two days. they've been playing reruns nonstop since like wednesday. this week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because monday and wednesday are my busy days. i want to get out of the city next weekend. maybe i'll go visit some friends at texas state or go to the lake. i haven't been swimming in really long time. i remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than i remember swimming in my own pool. maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. the trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but i never once got stung. the lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because i'm over half way done. the game on saturday was really fun. once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. unt didn't do very well. i almost went there instead of ut just because its close to home and my sisters went there. on the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. i don't know why i bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when i have a computer sitting right in front of me. its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. i hear a lawnmower outside. i feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on labor day. my neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. i should trim my fingernails. they keep getting in the way while i'm typing. i haven't seem a movie since i came to austin. i don't even know where a movie theater is around here. better yet, i don't know what is playing right now. i haven't seen any previews either. someone must be sick because i keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. people go out way too much. i can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. i always want to wait for the weekend. i'm sure that will change shortly though. this has been a very long weekend. i think i'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.

" so far i have been at ut for i guess 6 school days, and i can already feel myself slipping. school was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. why can't i go back? let's see. what did i do today? i woke up around 2 (we have lives around here), and was bugging my sister to take me to church. i haven't been there since i don't know how long, but i need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and i don't know how it made me feel. i want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. i don't want to desert him, but i don't know what he wants from me and what i can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth i have no idea what i was thinking when i went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. i don't know how i feel about him. i would like to be his friend, but that's it, and i also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing? guys. don't they all suck? i wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason i am still waiting for him to reply. i don't know what's wrong with me. maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. i get really tired and depressed when i think about my ex and i don't know what to do about it. i want to be his friend, but i know he wants more and i don't think i can offer him that. i need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. he comes from a broken home and has a lot of problems that i don't want to deal with. he's from port arthur and asked me to come down for his birthday. funny i was actually considering it. what's wrong with me? i called my little sister (12 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. neither were my parents. i think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and i miss them a lot. i need to come back and visit and i don't think i can do that until christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than christmas break. it really bothers me that i didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but i shouldn't be worried about that right? i am so unenergized right now. i need to go jogging or something, but it is late. i can't believe princess diana died. mother teresa also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as princess di. so much has happened in my short 17 years life span. i can actually tell my kids that i was alive when princess di and mother teresa died. it seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad? i just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. i don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to? my cousin is going through a break up right now and i don't know what i can do to help. i know she can do better than him, but i also know that she likes him a lot. what's a girl to do? i am really relieved that i don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am i still commenting on that? i was a lot better before he called. i just wish he could disappear and i don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is? i think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. i don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and i still have other things to do. thank goodness i remembered about this. i actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that i try to do at least twice a week. i really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 35 minutes so i'm outta here. lan ngoc ngo ",1,-0.695249 0.083016 1.370754 -0.332271 0.426398 0.681221 -1.18431 -1.220191 -1.323853 0.515256 -0.195627 1.730263 -1.105161 -0.257122 -1.335027 0.0 -0.04277 1.034862 0.385203 -0.59603 0.245913 -0.160927 1.603974 -0.778518 -0.624052 -1.330861 -0.750893 -0.094982 -0.761448 -0.854726 -0.806286 -1.1438 -0.026712 -0.210583 -0.781544 0.460881 1.238932 0.141082 1.103635 0.947975 -0.563338 -1.221466 -1.655712 -0.535997 -1.160889 0.230698 -0.072484 0.962637 -0.200209 1.017132 -0.084246 -1.104213 0.286327 0.745976 0.073132 -0.331019 -0.77134 -0.422838 0.159492 0.661566 -0.301792 0.164913 -0.104129 -0.060837 -0.206488 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.0406 -0.459921 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.92968 -0.37208 0.380165 -0.422267 1.22768 1.834095 0.716632 0.560451 5.038298 4.057837 4.811583 4.823192 4.494494,10
"i feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. i find that it gets so monotonous when i see the same person day in and day out. i don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so i guess i am very wary of commitment, although i wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. i miss the physical contact of a relationship. maybe i haven't been getting enough hugs lately. i haven't had one for about a week now. it does make a difference. you have to fend for yourself here at ut. no one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. i have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that i deem worthwhile. it seems like a lot of responsibility, but i am gradually learning how to handle it. i have never realized before how incredibly independent i am. i am in fact, lonely a lot more than i thought i was. at home i didn't feel it as much because i lived with four other people. but now, i notice that i get timid when i am alone. i didn't have a roommate for 2 weeks, and i thought i would like it because i would get privacy and free reign over the room. but i didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. i started eating a lot to fill the void. i never could figure out why i binged so much before, especially during high school. but now i think that i felt alone, and i was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. so i would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. that's weird how i wanted to be even more alone when i felt isolated. now i want to get involved with people as much as possible since i have recognized the problem. liz and i will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. i want to have my meals with at least one other person. it sucks to be alone, but at least i know that now. i have ten minutes to write. working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. it's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and i will be eating something for lunch soon. i don't want to eat alone! maybe brooke will eat w'me. i wonder what jason's up to now. he had an 8:00 class this morningi think? we spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. i like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. he's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. i don't know if i would want to start something with him. it would be a fun thing and add some ""extra"" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and i would not want to lose his friendship. i will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. i just want to be able to spend some time with him! i know i will though. there is that navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and i think i should go. i don't want to know what i look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. will i feel pressured a lot about godi just don't know if i'm on the right track. i read that the best way to get closer to god is to spend time with him. i so don't do that. i think about god about once or twice a day. i've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of god working in us, or something. i try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. i just want to be me. god i know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. if i just let go a little, i can go a long way with you. but my gosh it's hard to let go. let me see the ways i can let go. i'm going to go get something to eat for lunch.

"writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time, but i have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health. so, maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal. i'm listening to music right now while i do this and it is actually kind of distracting me. its for my history of rock music class which is actually kind of boring, but i heard its going to get better. as i write this i notice how incredibly bad at typing i am. other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 20 minutes. i am going to have like a couple of paragraphs. that is really sad. now, i am thinking all psychological though. i am like oooooh, they are going to read this and think that i compare myself to other people. "" i do compare myself to people all the time. i am very competitive. my arms hurt already. i do badly on computers. i hate staring at the screen. when teachers make you read articles off of the computer, i always have to print it out-which is kind of annoying. i also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when i am not thinking about making it good. i am kind of surprised i made an a in rhetoric. i loved rhetoric. it was really interesting for me. all my classes this semester seem interesting. tough-but interesting. geology is weird. hopefully it will get better. i found out today that i could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking psychology 301. i am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically. so i am sad, but psychology 301 will at least be a good introduction. and now i sound like a suck-up because this is for psych 301. and now i sound like i care about what people think. i do though to some extent. ooooooh fun song on. that swing swing song by all-american rejects. i like it a lot. it reminds me of the summer. i wish i would've seen american pie three. i didn't even see the first or second one though-haha. my room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here. she is strange and different, but she is really unique and i like her a lot. she is never here though. her boyfriend goes to a&m-just like my boyfriend. she always goes to their games and never has even been to a ut game! i told her she should come to the arkansas game with me and she was like ""oh yeah! we played them last week!"" we. we. she said ""we"" as though she was from a&m. she is crazy. my boyfriend lives in college station and you will never find me there. there is nothing to do. so, he comes to austin. i realize i have pictures of people in my room that i do not even like. i only have a picture of this girl jenny because she is really good friends with my boyfriend. she and i are cordial to each other in person. we hate each other really though. i know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. i hate that she hates me because i am usually nice to her. but , i hate her too. but she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. so, i think i have the right to not like her. wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. i still have 8 minutes left and i feel like i need to do something else. maybe that means i have add. i cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time. its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. i am behind in all of my classes. i study and read-i just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause i don't catch everything. like i try to keep up, but i can't. its bad. i need to study more but then i stress myself out if i don't do anything but study. i need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. i stress myself when i study 24'7. that is how it was over the summer. everyone else went to frat parties every night and i stayed in and studied. there were no organizations to be in. there were only frat parties. and i don't even like frat parties all the time. drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. and plus boyfriends do not generally like that. so, i stayed in and studied. i was so focused on my grades that i would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85. because i was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, i stressed out so much that i threw up. it was really bad. all of my friends were really worried about me. i passed out and everything. over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. i guess i am just not good with my time management. i don't know. something is really messed up with me i think. my boyfriend thinks i could use a counselor. but if i see a counselor i probably will not have time for activities besides school. and that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. i like that i am doing them. i hope i make lassos. i am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. we shall see.

"well, i'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. i'm about to start studying for chemistry and psychology so i do have a bit of work to do tonight. in chemistry i need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. i'm almost done with the psychology chapter i've been reading all week. it's the most interesting book i've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. all of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. today i met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because i haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. my phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so i'm just now able to get on the internet, which i've sorely missed. it was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. i have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. i'm glad someone picked up my shift at the outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. i want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. oh well, i guess i'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. i just got everything in my apartment organized today. i bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. i kind of like this assignment, i'm doing work but it's over what i'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. it's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. hopefully tomorrow i'll wake up on time considering that this morning i woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so i'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. it was fun.

"i am residing at castillian for my freshman year. i have my own personal room, which is more than i can say for others. it is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. the entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. all the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. my parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things i'd like to do. they try so hard to make me happy, but i'm not. i feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. i also believe that this was their full intention. we'll call it a bribe. they spit out money as long as i do well. this shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and i myself would like to succeed as best i can. the bribe, however, is the problem. i'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. you can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. i have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. i go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. when it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. already after the first day of class, i have messed up terribly on homework. i am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. in fact, it actually brought me to tears. an assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. i see myself as pathetic because i failed myself and because i can crack so easily. i can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 9 7 with a one hour lunch break each day. if i had to guess, i would say that i was unsure of everything. i'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. on top of this, i'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. i'm sure it will all level out in the end and that i'll eventually get the swing of things. as of now, however, i feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. i only wish i wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in france hadn't died last week). it only seems to complicate things. also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. all i know is that it seems so much right now.

"i am presently thinking that i cannot believe that i am actually going to sit here and write fo 20 minutes, that is a really really long time. well i am also thinking that i am fivxing to go to aerobics from 9:00 to 10:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. but i need to get into shape. i am worried that if i don't go and excersise i am going to gain that dreaded freshman 15 which will not at all be cool. i come fram a town of 20,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so i am sure that if i go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. well i just looked at the clock and i realized that i have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because i do not want to get cramps in my hands. i hate to type, because i am not very good at it and on top of that i do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after i checked and rechecked my work. so it does worry me that i will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. i cannot get itout of my head how weird i think this assignment is my friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. the girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and i was thinking that i love it when i hear that noise. earlier before i started this assignment i checked my e-mail and i had one new message from my friend travis who goes to sam houston state, i was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. which makes me think of the fact that i very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. i mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so i do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, i am getting really bored with this assignment because i am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. but i guess that you are used to that, i am like also wondering why i am acting like you are actually going to read this because i know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again i am reminded of my most recent message, which i was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one i go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, i do not like to be bothered when i am in the middle of doing somthing, but i have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, i know glanced at the clock again and i realize that at max i only have to type for 3 more minutes which excites me very much. my fingers are cramping and i am getting very old with this assignment i am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but i am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, i feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, i cannot wait until she is done so i can ask her what she thought about. well my time is up!!!

"i am very disappointed. its been raining all day and i'm tired. i didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. i can't stand not sleeping. sometimes i think that maybe i'm just not good enough for college, or at least ut. things have been hectic the whole time i have been on campus, and if i don't do good this semester, i'm going to fail out. i hope that i can pull this all off. the weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. i need to do stuff like that more often. i hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since i liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. i miss high school, sadly enough. i liked school a lot better when it was just me and 1500 other people. i knew everyone, everyone knew me. life was good. i can't stand this 50k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. i'm lucky to see a friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. oh well, i hope that life gets better soon. this weekend should be a lot of fun. oh, my pizza is ready, its been 18 minutes since i sat down. i spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. same old problem for me. i can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, i suck.

"i don't have to follow any rules except for the ones that i create for myself. as the days have gone by i have slowly but surely felt that i am alone. not being without my family has created feelings of sadness inside. i know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. i have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. i am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. i have been forced to come to terms with the fact that i am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. i must now assume total responsibility for myself. however i know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when i am in need of more money! rrhaha! i am really feeling excited about being in austin because i am closer to my sister in san antonio and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. i love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. i consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. harlingen, the town that i am from, has the population at ut and it is a rather conservative place. if some of the people in austin were to go down to harlingen and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. i love the fact that in austin all things go. going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because i did not know what to expect. i found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. also, i don't have to go to class if i don't want to. although i could not see that as a possibility because i feel if i do that, then i will fall behind and lose valuable information. i feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since i got here. i have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. i guess it is because i feel overwhelmed about being here at school. i just need to relax and enjoy this ride. i find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. i like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. my sister and her fianc' came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. he is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. he really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the oh my gosh, i'm so scared of college and i know i'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. overall i am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that i will experience here at the university of texas at austin.

" i'm thinking about how if i do this all the way through, i'll be late in meeting my girlfriend because i still have to shower and change. my clothes are in the dryer, getting wrinkle free because i'm too lazy to iron them. i'm thinking about last night and how leah and ia have been having some weird moments lately, but i think that i can attribute them mostly to stress. yesterday in dr. boetcher's office, she mentioned dana and him being the one that leah was dating. cat's out of the bag. i know, of course, and i've known for a while, but still to hear someone else say it. i wonder why she never told me right out that dana was her ex? its not like i'm stupid and i wouldn't put it together. alicia is iming me. . i haven't talke to her in a while. i wonder how her friend fran is. she was cute. alicia says that she's well and that nt hasn't changed. i don't miss it. or denton, really, which makes me wonder why i'm going back there this weekend to visit. i guess i just miss the people, but somehow i suspect that it will be weird to see them. to be so removed from them for months, it will all feel alien to me. i can't imagine myself there anymore. and teaching today. . ugh. i'm not really looking forward to it. i'm afraid that i won't remember my shit, that i won't be able to help these kids, which is what i'm getting paid to do. its kind of silly to worry though, after being surrounded by math and science for the past two years, i hope that i'll remember something. and i'm hungry. it weird seeing tamsters around school. its almost like they shouldn't be here. like when you see random people in a dream that creep you out because they don't seem like they should be allowed to invade your mind. i'm not used to all this reading in school. i wish i had a snickers. i'm used to math homework and bs like that, not actually having to read and digest stuff like that. i like it, just not used to it. i need to shower. i'm worried that i won't be able to finish this.

" i always pride myself on my ability to be creative but lately i feel restricted. i am spending more time absorbing everything around me than actually reflecting. i also feel lonelier than usual. i know this is normal, so i don't feel strange for the feelings. i am used to being surrounded by chaos and people i know. all of a sudden, i'm in a school more than twice as big as my town and a dorm more than twice as big as my high school. i am deep down enjoying the experience. on the surface, i am just caught up in reorganizing everything. i am also still recovering from last year. i keep thinking that things will pick up and that i will meet people. i don't know if it is just a slower process than i expect or if i have high expectaions. all i know is that i love austin as much as i miss new mexico. i miss the scenery and the openess but now i get to enjoy a more vibrant and colorful scene. more than anything, i am excited to be around new music. i am listening to grateful dead right now- as i have for the last year. right now, i feel that my scene suits the music more. i also am excited to be around live music. it has a better taste. i think i miss good new mexican food (burritos) almost as much as i miss my old room. i miss being able to walk down the street without running into another person if i feel like it. i miss my friends. i miss being able to have inside jokes and laugh without even talking. i think i have more potential for good friends because austin appeals to a particular crowd including myself. in nm, i made friends with the peop[le that were available. in austin i will make friend with people that i hve common interests with. that is why it takes more time. i am not used to the freedom that i have recently obtained. i want to experiment with the limits of my freedom, but i just haven't found good opportunies. i haven't done much since i've been here. i can't tell if i'm lazy, timid, or just in the process of figuring out my niche. education is more interesting when it is by willpower. i like learning when i have the choice to go to class. i also get the idea the teachers in college enjoy teaching more. that may be a generalization. i'm a bit scared aobut tests. i don't know how to study yet. i actually was scared yesterday, but not today. i bought a to-do list yesterday and wrote down everything that i need to do. even though i haven't checked off much, i feel so much more organized knowing that it's written down. i actually fell more compelled to check stuff off (that's why i'm writing this now). i hope i don't fall victim to my lack of self dicipline and poor study habits. i truly enjoy being disorganized and careless. i think it gives me more personality and a more colorful life. a reckless and wild life has its o elegant motion. more than anything, i think having careless adcventures (i. e. hitchiking home from a party) makes me more creative. all i want to do in life is to write. well, i want to do more, but that's my main ambition and source of happiness. i think adventures inspire what i write just as much as education builds a foundation. all of my college experience will be relevant. i get excited writing about what i want, but i then look back at the time i've been here and feel a bit unaccomplished. my wrist keeps popping when i type, and it really hurts. i have to slow down. i should probably start working out again if typeing at my computer is strenuous. my roommate is cleaning our room right now. she is a bit cumpolsive, but i'm glad that it inspires me to stay organized. well, i'm organized on the surface. my closet and drawers are a different story. i love how i decorated my room. i think interior design is next on the list to writing. i wish i could study it, but i don't think i could make it into the school of architecture ",1,1.484676 0.666874 0.034752 0.646378 0.933703 0.287691 0.581747 0.227428 1.055191 0.322137 -0.190507 -0.590446 -0.405378 -0.349581 1.453806 0.0 -0.04277 0.296315 1.566951 -0.58259 1.496369 -0.742368 -1.377539 -0.933655 -0.624052 0.261842 0.246301 -0.784947 0.972204 1.217158 2.03726 0.71414 0.107474 -0.16373 -0.765616 1.907463 -0.226755 0.057259 0.015799 0.279964 -0.023895 -1.227465 -0.754645 -0.553711 -1.14279 -0.832844 1.086093 -1.370007 -0.858485 -1.537135 -0.448445 -0.493055 -0.744209 0.190061 0.192622 0.697228 -0.199015 3.016252 -0.434429 0.610619 -1.162822 -1.06186 -0.480161 -0.01473 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.435594 -0.141479 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.045701 -0.422267 -0.086107 2.801289 0.311962 0.118378 4.700248 4.007011 4.772004 5.217543 4.720113,1671

"i guess right now i would be feeling on edge, or wary. it is on rare occassion that i have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. i worry about everything, though. i worry about this class. what will the tests be like? am i studying enough? how many times should i review the material? i know that it is better to ""overlearn"" something, but in doing so, i think i will go crazy. i try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top of the previously assigned work. i cannot convert into a complete ""bookworm"" because i would not be at ease with myself. i need time to relax and just chill with my friends. it is almost a set system that i have with myself that i read as much as i can, and then i go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. it's kind of ironic that the thing i reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, i have a killer soar throat. from what, i have no idea. it's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. i'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because i hate being sick. i love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. yes, i am aware of dayquill, but it has such a bad taste. gross. it does work, though. hopefully what i have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever i had the other day. i was burning up. the only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. i took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the hbsa called to invite me out to eat. i really wanted to go, but i couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that i couldn't go because i want to be able to be as involved as i can in any organization that i join. i felt as though i had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. thursday, i will hosting for apple computer at the hbsa company night. i think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but i need to do some ""boning"" up on the apple company before i speak with any of the recruiters. of course, i will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when i have four classes, and which is also the day that i promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night i was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. from everything i have mentioned, i have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that i am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if i really could have done something or not, or even where i stand in life. weeks before i came to ut, it seemed like i had a firm grip on life. i had a group of friends that i partied with all the time, and while i knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while i still have my ties, i now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, ""what am i doing with myself?"" i know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because i am ""building"" myself, but i don't think i can completely be myself yet, because i don't know ""completely"" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, ""be yourself.

"i am worried about my brother, bobby, right now. my mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the er. she said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. tonight i went to church with my best friend, amanda. we sang a lot, which i love. i'm not necessarily the best singer, but i really enjoy it. all the songs we sang tonight, i knew from my church at home in plano. that made me happy. i also signed up for teams at church. right now i am a little frustrated though because amanda and i are trying to do our art history homework, but the website won't let me download the article i need. very frustrating!!! oh, i need to go wash my dishes when i'm done with this. amanda and i made chili-cheese dogs. they were great!! my roommate, sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around austin alone in the dark. i have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for friday on two pieces of music that i have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. i just found out about the assignment today. school is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. all day i listened to one of the best songs i have heard in a long time called ""how could i"". the music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. i have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper i have to write is about 20 pages long. i didn't get much sleep last night because i was trying to read for art history because i don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. i woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. i won't get much sleep tonight either. amanda has music playing in the background right now, but i don't know who is singing. i like the way it sounds though. tonight i taught amanda how to tap dance. it was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and i taught her a few basics. she and i have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so i am going to teach her. she is going to teach me pointe, because i haven't done ballet in three years. i have a bad knee, and last summer i had knee surgery, so i haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. i only took tap and jazz. i miss ballet though. since i've moved to austin, i've really missed dance because i don't have a dance studio here. i would like to go take some classes, but i think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and i can just practice at home. i bought new pointe shoes the other day. we had to walk many many miles to get them. today in geology class, we played football and sang the ut fight song standing up with the ""hook 'them"" sign in the air. it was a very interesting class. right now i wonder if anyone has imed me on aim. i'm really tired, but i won't be able to sleep tonight because i need to do school work. my parents might go to the bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully i may go as well. i haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. that reminds me, i miss my family in virginia. maybe i can fly out there this summer. that would be fun. virginia is beautiful. the chesapeake area especially. i'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. but he will be fine. i cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (i have to do chores around the house because i live in a co-op). tomorrow i think i'm going to sleep in between classes. i only have two discussion sections. sijia just got home!!

"i'm not sure since i've just started college and haven't had any tests yet. i need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now i'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will i ever get some sleep. not if i have to keep typing this damn assignment. but who needs sleep anyway i wondering if i have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am i to judge people for being nasty. my girlfriend just said that i'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. i need to be working so i can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that i have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which i'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because i don't have enough time to study since i have to work to. oh i'm wondering if they are going to open the ut tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. i don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. it has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. but live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. my significant other is wondering what i'm typing right now, so i am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that i just typed about 15 minutes ago. anyway, i'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so i have to go chase her so that i can return her safely to the ocean. alright then bye know because i've been typing for twenty minutes and i need to go smoke a cigarette.

" i am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, austin. it is overwhelming right now solely because i don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. i enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. my goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. i am feeling a little homesick though, because i am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. i miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. i am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. everyone knows eachother and i sometimes feel alienated. i am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. which causes me to lose concentration at times. it is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. especially at night when they come running in all drunk. i smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging theta. my roommate and i just got through with rush and are excited about our new sorority. i know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. i am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. it is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. i realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that i will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. i love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. our room is all tidy and neat. i know my mom would be happy. i really love this city of austin. it is so fun and such a party place. it also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. i'm not all into this every night party life. don't get me wrong i love to party and all, but to a certain extent. i'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. you become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. one thing i want to do while at school here for the next 4 years is discover who i really am. when you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? i want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. i am contemplating on whether i want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. it seems like im always on the go here, too. there is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. as you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. i notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. my computer just froze for the longest time so for about 5 minutes i couldn't write. so i am going to start again, because for 5 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. it is making me very aggravated. so in case you know this i am still typing after the 20 min time period, because 5 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. well, i am hoping that i will learn my away around austin soon because this city is very confusing. i just want to have a notion of where everything is. i hate not knowing my way around places. well, i am going to end it now because i timed an extra 5 min on my clock and it is up. j m y ",0,0.083167 -1.327911 0.706373 -0.850965 -0.640345 0.836548 1.005827 0.658347 0.620624 0.163098 -0.162198 -0.309148 -0.478285 0.499524 0.690228 0.0 -0.04277 -0.834126 -0.393099 0.557143 -0.264716 0.571769 -1.184801 -0.640406 -0.624052 -0.048301 0.105744 -0.204479 1.126276 0.895889 0.560665 -0.457591 0.532464 1.058726 0.050706 0.665118 -0.411421 1.380561 -0.540482 -1.227624 -1.038726 -0.41863 2.559156 -1.565904 -1.429535 -1.04165 -0.228133 0.088942 -0.80215 -0.519555 0.793494 1.55384 -1.051906 0.255501 0.704684 1.365683 -0.340685 -0.353717 1.840144 -0.972367 0.116973 0.109546 -0.055219 0.414868 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.013431 -0.137788 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.347136 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.170251 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.749983 4.919631 4.481985 4.734415 4.814735 4.094053,1584
"coincidentally i always manage to surround myself with strange characters that unfortunately seem to have no passion for life, with the exception of a few. i seem to notice that the majority of people are concerned with the trivial, the meaningless the absurd. fitting into societal norms seems to dominate my generation. i feel a tremendous amount of pressure to fulfill my existence to the maximum without leaving pout my loved one's or those who do not seem to pursue the same spiritual quest that i seem to be challenged with. the awakening of this dream has led me to search more ""myself"". where should i begin? it is rare when i feel somebody is listening or understanding where i come from. these strange characters which i always seem to attract are convinced that their perspective on things is the only thing that matters and that the phenomenon of life is something one should get over, move on, think about something else like how you are going to succeed in life. i live in a dream state where the symbols of nature are constantly confronting me leaving me confounded and in awe but how do i move past that in order to fulfill and answer many of my questions which at this point are leaving me insatiable. lately i've been paying attention to my dreams. i've noticed a pattern of dreams that lead or signal to a higher source , being, state of consciousness. i can't contemplate the beauty, the colors, it all seems so supernatural and nobody seems to understand much least care about what they're. i've also had a couple f nightmares where i am constantly being watched and followed by a large amount of males. i guess i have difficulty and although i ashamed about this, i have a hidden fear of the male gender. i look around and i see a patriarchal world that insists on leading me to believe that everything is difficult and only the very best, the smartest will survive and coincidentally most of them happen to be men. anger dominates this thought, all my life i've been able to pull through ""waking up"" has made me realize that we are in ""deep shit'. i mean i walk into my college chemistry class and this beautiful blonde woman is teaching this class of about 500 people and i am in awe. why is it so difficult to contemplate that a woman does have the innate ability to do science. this woman reminds me of myself. i am mad at myself for finding myself noticing the fact that she is female. i question how she is treated by her male dominated colleagues. do they underestimate her, how hard does she have to work in order to prove herself, and if she were ugly would it make a difference. it is too difficult to overlook these questions i face them everyday. constantly have to prove myself and i am sick and tired of the preconceived notions that people have about women ",1,1.834263 -1.450771 -0.8403 -1.41736 -1.226048 -1.115969 3.158208 2.357853 3.000389 -0.605593 -0.047805 0.007313 1.166916 -0.284711 2.913922 0.0 -0.04277 -0.621946 -0.310946 -0.480696 -0.45752 -0.436506 0.105236 -0.499788 -0.624052 1.076996 1.2585 -0.523681 0.622025 -0.567533 0.291418 0.381373 1.543867 0.191471 1.593696 -1.109326 -0.765605 0.027962 -0.151688 -1.707833 -1.038726 -0.305569 -0.12767 -1.182401 -0.157665 -1.192831 -0.287852 0.028994 -0.399567 -0.186651 2.638548 -2.242647 -0.899566 0.522626 -0.860783 -0.394717 0.010573 -0.954251 1.146354 -0.027357 -0.503716 -0.00844 0.113264 0.334811 -0.009726 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.882157 -0.127272 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.243778 -0.37208 -0.337085 1.877906 -0.73527 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.91711 4.433493 4.449678 3.908211 4.159002 5.343495,619
"i am a freshman at ut but it is not a new experience for me. my older brother and sister both went here and my brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. i see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 3rd week of school and they should know where they're going but they don't. i'm just really glad that it's not me. i am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if i was all alone. i like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. i do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the art institute of dallas. dallas is where i am from although it has changed a lot since i first moved there. i can't wait until this thursday when i can go home to see greg, my boyfriend again. i have been in serious relationships before but never have i been so much in love. ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. i can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. as corny and ""leave it to beaver"" as that may sound, that is really what i want to do. my real life goal was always just to be a mom and nothing else. i didn't want a ""real job"" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. but, my dad said that i was too smart to do that and that if one day i just happened to be on my own i needed a good education so that i could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. it actually never occurred to me that i wouldn't go to college until he said that. i wanted to go to college for 4 years, but i guess i was just thinking that i wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. i was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. but, anyhow, here i am and i'm loving it. it is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. but there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. so it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 8 hours. enough about that though, bad memories. i am here now not knowing quite what to expect. i took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. the faster i get out, the better. but i know that ut is nothing like a junior college in any way. and i also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. which is good because if this school was easy, i wouldn't learn anything that i would remember longer than the test. but, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. they go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 3 hours later. and maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. but that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school.

"wow, i can't believe i'm finally here. i've waited so long to get to the point that i am in my life right now, and now that i'm finallly here i feel like i really am not. i return to that same question that i've always grappled with. what is my purpose?? if i was religious in any sense then i might be compelled to believe in the ""obvious. "" but i am not and therefore i must pretend to be purposeful and hope that in the end my lufe will be fulfilling. what did i throw away with mike? or did i throw it away? only time will tell i guess. i will say that i have never known such unconditional love as that which i had from him. i crave excitement though. a restless mind, i suppose. and a restless heart. one day i will meet my match i feel. someone who will mirror me in my restlessness. we will feel out the world together and find happiness in adventure and passion. false idealism perhaps - or perhaps not. i burn with anger for what happened to amber. anger for whoever violated her and anger in myself for not seeing it coming. let me correct myself - anger for actually seeing it coming and not doing anything about it. i've seen this coming to her for a year at least. and i never said anything to her. i learn from others, but i suppose others don't always learn from me. thank god she's ok. perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. well, a new start and new people await here. i feel like the world has handed me a gift and now it is my responsibility to embellish upon it. it's all there on a silver platter for me to grapple with, and i do intend to grapple. i'm putting in my two weeks notice on august 1st. counting down the days. my job has become such a headache. the money is good, the hours suck, and now the people suck. why does money mean so much to me? i feel like a green-eyed monster and i'm only 18 years old. i'm already thinking about investing. thinking about doing a little research and putting my money where my mouth is. i plan on being in the six digits by the time 30 rolls around. what do you see when you look into people's eyes? eyes are the windows to the soul. i can read so much into a person by looking at their eyes while they talk. so what am i doing with blue contacts? what am i trying to hide? what do i want to become? i think i would trust my warm brown eyes over my glacier-blue contacts any day. all in the fun i guess. a mystery to others and maybe even to myself. casper is so peaceful. i wish i were a dog sometimes. to be caressed and loved all day and to give unconditional love without material or superficial worries must be pure emotional ectasy. not a care in the world. my bed is calling.

"today has been a pretty good day. i am a little worried about my computer class because i can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. i am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. i wish my ex would call me just to check and see how i am doing. never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. i start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. hopefully i will make the team. that would be really cool, except if i made varsity somehow, i would miss my family. if i was on varsity i would get to travel a lot, all over the us, but i would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. i think college is harder than i thought it was going to be. but, the internet up here, the dsl i have at my apartment, is really fast. i downloaded some songs in like two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. my shoulders are hurting, and i am a little cold. i need some extra sleep. i shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up friday and saturday. i think i ate too much earlier, and now i am too full. well, i know i have a lot to do tonight. i have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. i took care of my pretesting last night so now i don't have to worry about it. i really need a neck and back massage. i miss talking to my grandma every night. i miss living with her too. college is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because i am responsible for more things than i use to be. i just miss the security i think i felt in high school. if i thought back, i'm sure i would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. but i need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing i can do if i don't want to end up living in a box on the street. i hope everything works out the way i always dreamed it would, and i hope i end up in a job that i love. i don't want to spend thirty years in a job that i hate. i would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. i would much rather be happy than rich. sometimes, though, i don't think that way. i know i am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. and what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. it is going to be hard on me when she dies. but i am not going to think of that now, because that is in the lord's hands, not mine. i wish dwayne would call me. why? why do i keep saying that? damn. that is why i am going to stay up here next weekend. if i stay up here, maybe, hopefully, i won't think about him as much. and, i will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. i have slacked off the past couple of days, and now i'm going to pay for it. especially tonight, i am hoping to get caught back up. i wish i could go to bed right now. i am cold. need to turn the thermostat down. maybe it would save some money if i didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. but, if i didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, i wouldn't be cold. in fact, knowing me, i would be hot. okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. i wish i had pants on, instead of shorts, then i wouldn't be cold. i wish i had turned the thermostat down before i started this stream of consciousness. i was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so i am glad i am taking this class. there is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. he makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and i don't know anything about skateboarding. i also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. he does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. i mean, when does this fucker sleep? oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. if i lived upstairs i wouldn't stomp around like that. it is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. i wish i could go shopping instead of doing the homework i am going to have to do. that would be nice. i don't know if i am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. that sucks really bad. i want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. yeah, and go to academy. i hope college gets easier as i get used to it more. i hope it happens soon.

"right now i am very hacked off because it has taken me 30 minutes to find this home page using this very complicated computer. i'm not used to using macs and it is very annoying. i also don't know why this screen doesn't scroll down. that is very annoying also along with this keyboard i'm using. well i'm tired of complaining so i will start thinking about something else. i have to leave for my home town in 30 minutes because i have a court date tomorrow. my stepdad will be here and i'm sure he's going to complain about traffic. i hope he takes me to eat somewhere because i'm tired of dorm food. i can't think of anything to write so i'll write that. this assignment is very weird and i don't know how anything can come of it. what should i say? i don't consciously know what i am thinking so i don't know what to type. i'm just sitting here trying to think of something profound to say. that is stupid considering that i don't have to say anything important but i guess that is what i'm used to doing when i write an assignment. right now i'm staring at a picture of a whale's tale as it dives into the ocean. it really looks kind of stupid and i can't think of anything else to say about it. you psychology people are strange and i wonder what the heck you're going to do with all these papers that are basically garbage. are you going to do some experiment or what? this is not what i am good at. just writing what i think because i usually think about 3 or more subjects at a time and i can't type fast enough to get everything i'm thinking onto the page. oh well. oops i made a grammatical mistake. this is very boring and i'm tired of typing. thank god i only have two more minutes of this. hey now it's only one minute. well, it's been nice sharing what 's in my brain with you and i hope you have fun studying what i've written for hours upon hours. i hope it helps in whatever you hope to accomplish. see ya.

" today is thursday, september 12th. yesterday was 9'11. i wasn't too scared about it cause i knew that nothing would happen. it was just kind of sad, i guess. everytime i turned on the t. v. there was something about it. the sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. by the end of the day, i was just kind of fed up with it. there was this one part that certaintly got my attention. on mtv, they were having this 30 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 9'11. there was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. i think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an muslim, he was a shikh or something. i mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire muslim society. i mean there are 1 billion muslims, they can't all be terrorists. but i don't really blame them, cause i mean even if i was in their places, i would kind of react the same way. although, i would try not to. but, now things are changing. not many people hate you just because one is a muslim. oh well, enough about this. i saw this cute chick on 9'11. she was in the biology class. she was just sooo cute. i should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. hopefully, i will see her next time. today was the draw for the texas-ou game. i didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 80000s, and the tickets were sold out at 79450. this kind of . . i mean only 450 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. i was really disappointed. but i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years. i am going home this weekend, first time after school started. i am really looking forward to it. just need a few days away from ut. its seems like i have been here more than 3 weeks. it should be fun. i also have test coming up starting next week. hopefully i will do good. i really need to make as many as as i can. i have to transfer to the school of business, which is the hardest to get into. hopefully, i will get in. after i get done with this, i have to finish my calculus homework. its due tomm at 3 in the morning. what kind of time is that. last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 3 in the afternoon. i didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. i was done with it too. i was sooooooo mad. i guess i learned my lesson though. but still, 3 in the morning, whats up with the time. i had a quiz in economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. last week's quiz was a piece of cake. it was sooo easy. i hate when teacher'sorry professors do this. they make the first test'quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. be consistent, you know. i have 3 minutes left, ummm, this class is kind of fun. i like dr. penebaker, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. but my economics professor is just as cool, dr. hamermesh. both of the class are fun. cal and chemistry are alright, not as much fun. it is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. ut is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. i guess i am getting used to it though. well my time is up. it was fun writing this. its kind of girly though, like a journal.

" college. . humm. its strange that i'v made it this far. i always viewed college as a date in a book that i would eventually reach, but not now. there is absolutely nothing familiar anymore. my days are completely different. i guess change is good though, i mean there is no place i would rather be in life than right here. so why am i so worried all the time? constantly tierd. my eye has developed a slow twitch, very strange. i miss my cat. i wish i had the ability to purr. if only i were a cat. the weirdest thing about college is waking up. every day of my life until now i have woken up in my bed or some state of comfort. now when i wake up there is that small period of time when i think i am still there, safe, but then reality smacks me in the face. my roomate is really good at that in the morning, helping me realize that im not at home. very annoying! i wish i enjoyed my roomates companey, but i don't not at all. she smacks while eatting, very inconsiderate, keeps the room at 34545 million degrees. ah what am i going to do, not a whole lot, i guess its a good learning expeirence. i must say i have met some cool people though, which make the ride all worth while. counting crows,, ahh, for some reason they know exactly what i am feeling. they hit the nail on the head . i wish i could talk to adam durtz, and spell correctly. the thing that i have noticed about college is there are more headachs and less sleep. more headachs, less sleep. i really should deal with this problem. it seems impossible with all the things i have to get done but eventually i have found that everything works it self out. time, time , time. i do not believe in time. there really is no point to time. well at least keeping track of. i mean time is good for healing and new stages in life. but why do we put it on such a small scale. i mean it should just be a concept, like infinity. i mean i wish i could not say at this exact moment it is . . 12. 01. 01. there should only be moments and nothing more. we all live in one big moment. another thing thats been on my mind is something a friend and i were talking about. he said why does society make squares out of everything. i mean think about it the majority of buildings in this world are in the square shape, rooms are square, tiles are square, i think i might go out in the square hallway and take a drink from the square water fountian. it is exausting. why would someone go to such detail to make a square out everything. the name square even sugessets boring. why not an oval, or better yet an amiba. no one can box me in. i also am frustrated with the fact that everyone wants to have a career,example, yeah i'm pre-med, ohh yeah well i'm going to be an engineer i really have to desier to make something of myself . what my career will be is sitting in italy,no preference really any where in italy will do, with a big family,lots of animals, and friends walking around soaking upp all the history, looking at the arcitecture, and most importaltly just being happy. i could just learn the rest of my life. with no money , which is a square by the way. .

"okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. i have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. but i am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but i am getting the hang of college life. most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. i want to stay, besides i went to dallas last weekend for labor day for my sister's birthday. i got to see my best friend zach who is now in colorado trying to wrestle. but i am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since i will there the first weekend of october for txou and the santana concert. then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. my oldest sister maggie is bringing her new fiance. i haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. they both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a catholic church. catholicism is kind of funny that way i come from a very strong catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the university of dallas which is catholic and not liberal ut. however, my parents strategically placed my in dobie, next to the university catholic center. smart people. little do they know the last time i went to church was when i was in dallas. my dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what i have wanted to do for the majority of my life. but last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now i am in dean speck's architecture class which is fascinating i love it. who knows when i'll figure out what i want to do, i do have the feeling that no matter what i decide to do that i'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. but that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. my sister jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her lsat and apply to law school. she is even applying to ut law that would be cool if she was down here too. i like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. it's not that she places that responsibility on me but i am the closest to her out of my family so i am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. yeah, she's applying to law school. at least she has some sort of direction. it's hard for her to hear the truth. but i slammed it down her throat this summer and i think it hit her. i wonder when kim is getting home. i think she said 5:00. i like having the whole suite to myself though i can actually get some stuff done. we have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with reese. reese is probably lonely without jessica around to bug her. i hope i get her as my diamond sister, that would be really cool. kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see dave matthews band one of my favorites. i have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so i don't think i am going to go. unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. i'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. i miss my dog. it took me 17 years to get a dog and i finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and i leave for school. i'll probably breed labs when i'm older i love labs and i don't see why i'd ever have any other kind of dog. my suitemates are really organized i am typing on amy's computer and i'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, i'm done!

"well, i am now officially writing my first college paper"" more or less. it is really hot outside today. i wonder when it is going to cool of so i won't swear so bad when i walk to class. i think that i need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when i get them, instead of putting them off. it makes me feel like i am bogged down when i have a lot of stuff to do at once. it is actually really stressful. i kind of like this song that is on the radio. busta rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper, but i think that this song is ok. pharrell really makes this song what it is. now come to think of it. i don't think that busta rhymes sang that song. oh well i guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes, so i won't correct my mistake. my chair is pretty comfortable. hopefully i will do my homework in it when i am done with this writing assignment. the longhorns really kicked new mexico state's butt. i think that chance mock (the quarterback) got to a ruff start, but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the longhorn's quarterback. although vincent young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal, scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts, and throwing a great 60 yard pass, i believe that mock should continue to start as qb because he has put in his time as scout team player. my, that was a really long sentence. i am tired of eating the food at the jester food court. they have a big selection, but the selections never change at each station. i kinda miss my mom's home cooking. i can get over that. i was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus, but i guess that i didn't think that i would see so many people going to class everyday. i kind of feel like a minority in austin. coming from a small town in east texas that is mostly white, black, and mexican, i am not used to seeing so many asian students. i am not against asian people at all, i just have never seen so many at one setting such as ut. the temperature in my dorm is not to my liking. i am a very hot natured person, and i prefer that it be cold in my room. being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling. i dislike sweating when i sleep. i need to go to the gym today. i am getting out of my routine of working out each day. i need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play. it is kind of hard to be disciplined once you don't have your parents to tell you what to do. the experience at ut is a good one though and i am not complaining. the only thing i dislike about it right now is that i still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks. the co-op did not have my mis book today like that re-order said. nothing is ever perfect. that is not a bad thing though. i hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy czar. this is an easy grade. there are so many fine girls here at ut. everywhere you look you see a hottie. i love that. some of them seem fake to me though, but i know that i shouldn't judge people. my phone is ringing and i am almost done. alright i am done. later.

"it is 12:53 on tuesday and my roommate and i just finished eating lunch and came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. my computer in our room is not hooked up to the internet yet, so for the time being i have to come down here. that's ok. the guy just came over because we forgot to give him our ids. oops. oh well. anyway, i'm really sad lately. i miss all my friends from high school. everyone i've met so far has been really nice and everything; i just miss how close we all were last year. i could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that i knew and would feel comfortable with. here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many people that i don't know. every face that i pass on campus is another stranger. actually, i have seen a few people that i know from other places. earlier today i saw brittany. but it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. i was so comfortable there. i don't know. i should probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since i'm going off about high school and college and what have you, but i'm kind of just blabbering so whatever. i am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. i miss my comfort zone that i had at anderson and i want it back!! hey! i just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. i guess i can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. it's probably been more like seven minutes. i don't like this keyboard. it's kind of hard to type on. this assignment is actually harder than i thought it would be. i mean, it's not hard, because i'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. i think it's crazy that so many anderson people are in my psychology class. it also freaks me out that alex is in our class. since you don't know about alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. i think underneath that tough guy russian thing he has going for him he's really probably a very nice person, but i don't know how easy it is for me to look past the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at city park. so i wouldn't fail alex if i were you. he might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it ""axe"" or ""ax""? i don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. i would really like to get to know him though - i think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. i think that time is probably almost up, but i would kind of like to keep writing. i think i will. the temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. i don't know where that thought came from. i am scared about having to write papers. what if my professors don't like the way i write? i've always loved to write, but i like writing creatively. i'm pretty bad at comparing and contrasting and all my research papers are boring. i mean i got good grades on them, but later i'd go back and read them and be like ""hey did i actually write this? yuck. "" i think i'm probably being hard on myself. i wonder how many times i have used the word probably in this assignment so far. i bet a lot. i hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. i wonder what angie's deal is. she used to be so nice, but ever since dis and i rushed she has been so rude. that's her problem, i know. and it kind of always justifies the fact that i didn't like her that much. i always had to act like i did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has always rubbed me the wrong way. that's what i told brian. brian -- what to do about brian? i wish i knew i wish i could have some answer. i hate leading him on the way i did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. i know he needs me and that's what i love about him. when i'm around him i feel special and needed and important. but i just don't know if that is enough.

" i just walked in my room from going out and it seems the ac is not working. the room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days. the smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as i look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor. two canvases lay on the stained carpet. the idea was to paint each one different, but to have the same motif. it was harder to come up with an idea than i thought it would be. that was a few hours ago, which was before i had a glass of the fratty punch. it's so silly, how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol. what are they trying to do to us? women are not primitive. we understand what they have in mind. see, if it was up to the guys, they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn. but it is the punch that us ladies enjoy, and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply. as i stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys' house, i suddenly asked myself a question. do these boys really want to talk to me? i wondered. and if they do. why? two things quickly were brought to my attention. one was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company, or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on, one which by the way took me 35 minutes to pick out. how ironic huh?! the other was the fact that if they didn't desire to converse with me, that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk, and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties. it was then that i realized that either way, they were talking to me, and i got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne, as well as to look into their dreamy eyes! those stupid frat boys. man are they dumb, but they sure are entertaining!!!

"i just woke up and i am feeling so drowsy. i just went to a belly dancing show yesterday and i am thinking about how fun it was. man that iranian guy at the club was so hot, i wish i could go up to him and talk to him, but i'm too scared. i feel like i'd be rejected in two seconds. he didn't even look at me, or did he? that dirty old arab guy was freaky though, he kept asking me to dance with him and that made me really uncomfortable. i am really really hungry, and the droning of the refrigerator isn't making the situation any better. i'm afraid to even open the refrigerator door because it smells so bad in there. we really need baking soda. i wonder if the chemistry test is going to be hard, i really hope i understand the difference between atoms and molecules and i don't completely blank out during the test. this assignment is really cool, it's helping me empty out everything in my head. it is extremely cold in here and i want to go talk to that guy on the second floor. he was such a nice person and i haven't really met any iranians here. i hope the iranians in the isaco club are nice and they aren't like all those fake iranian girls that dye their hair blonde and all have nose jobs and live at the mall. that reminds me of bahareh, she was such a rude, mean stupid girl. she had no right in saying those things to me, and for some reason i can't get over it. i am thinking of erfon, i wonder what happened to him, he reminds me of kourosh, i hope he doesn't become afraid of me like kourosh did though. i wonder why kourosh is acting like that? i haven't talked to him in a really long time, he shouldn't be intimidated by me! anyway my hand is beginning to hurt and my pants are really loose on me i think if i lose any more weight they will fall off! ut's campus really makes you work out man, i wouldn't have even lifted a finger if i had gone to a college in houston, but this school makes you work. i am taking a lot of science courses, and i hope i can handle it. i talk to god at night and i hope he hears me, i hope he helps me get through all my classes successfully, i mean, my parents expect me to get all a's. dad said if i don't' come home with a 4. 0 gpa then i shouldn't even come home. that's not fair and how come they always compare me to neema? it's not fair that i'm known as the not so good"" kid, even though i've never done anything bad in my life. i mean for god's sake i've never even gone on a date so why should they think i'm the ""bad kid""? i guess it's because neema gets along with mom so much better. i really wish i had a good relationship with mom, it sucks how we can't get along ever. she was right when she said yesterday that we can't stand each other for more than a few seconds a day. we just don't understand each other, she keeps lecturing me and it pisses me off. there is only so much one person can stand, you know? i can't take being lectured three hundred hours a day, it makes me sick, how would you like it if someone kept telling you bla bla don't do this bla bla don't do that. dad is so much easier to get along with, although he has a temper like a mofo and he is stubborn as hell! he is such a kind gentle man, i love my dad, he works so hard for our family, i hope to repay him with success. i hope he lives forever, i hope they both live forever. my legs are beginning to hurt and there is a piece of hair that has fallen on my arm and it tickles me! for some reason, i woke up this morning and my hair was curly, it was the strangest thing, usually my hair is a giant nappy fro, but today it was pretty and silky. ut isn't as humid as houston, and i'm glad. dude i really miss nasim, she is such an awesome person. i emailed her the other day, but she never ever checks her email. i wonder why i never call anyone! i feel so rude when people call me and tell me, ""uh how come you haven't called us that's so inconsiderate"" but i'm just not a phone person, i guess. i really should call people back and let them know i care, i think i get this aspect of my character from mom because she doesn't like calling people either. it's not that i don't like talking to my friends, it's just that i never think to call them. i will though, definitely, today i will call sogol and ponta and nasim. i will call stephanie and jennifer and batool. well i'm sitting in a room that is covered with various books and study guides and it's all a bit overwhelming. i really hope i can handle everything, although, i seem to switch out of every class i think is too hard. which is really a dumb thing to do because it means i can't handle challenges. i really need to swallow my fear and just take risks. i would take risks although all my friends are grandmas and they are so cautious that i think it might be rubbing of on me too. i need to go find friends that don't mind driving around campus at 2 a. m. but i don't want friends that drink. what on earth is up with drinking? what is so great about it? there is no way in hell i'm going to drink. so many people have told me ""oh don't worry marjon, you'll start drinking when you get in college"" uhhh no i'm not, i think i know myself better than anyone else knows me and i know i'm not going to drink. i don't even think i'm going to date, i'm so afraid of rejection. i've been rejected a million times before in my own head that i can't fathom going out and actually trying to get a date. i mean i don't really know if people reject me, i think i'm being paranoid when i say that, sometimes a flicker of someone's eye sparks me off and i think they don't like me. i guess that makes me kind of insecure, or paranoid. sometimes i make too much of situations, i over analyze and i think that what was a casual gesture was a gesture of hate? i don't know what i'm getting at here, perhaps i am not a very good judge of character. although if i weren't a good judge of character than i would have horrible friends. like nasim, nasim's friends are absolutely terrible, they teach her bad things and they put holes in her brain. she is such a pretty girl i wish she had stray away from that stuff and start studying so that she can come to ut. man if you have brains and beauty, that's a big plus in this world, everything in america is aesthetic, i've noticed that. people are more inclined to talk to you if you are pretty. people don't give a crap about you if you aren't pretty. it's so superficial and stupid. i wish people's inner beauty could shine through, because most of the really gorgeous girls aren't deep. they are like a pond they are so shallow. i think it is time to get up because my feet have both fallen asleep and i know when i stand they will burn like pin pricks in my fee ",0,-0.182033 1.428348 -0.150379 1.213277 1.503494 -0.228659 -0.642668 -0.616751 -0.317991 2.802393 -0.090886 0.730915 -1.435611 -0.670731 -0.711123 0.0 -0.04277 0.895124 0.326207 -0.11057 0.314398 0.699429 0.90797 0.104035 -0.624052 -0.478213 -1.128028 -0.481896 0.662749 -0.103346 -0.595611 0.540524 1.096869 0.884793 0.876046 -0.031088 -0.363829 -0.038674 0.055784 0.06017 -0.766691 0.276619 0.042455 0.56887 -0.968347 1.374835 -0.217102 1.366348 1.267446 1.050368 1.663803 -1.402985 -0.349682 0.208215 -0.68555 -0.534052 -0.446945 -0.041967 0.400467 -0.252309 -0.065119 -0.012949 0.380558 -0.353582 0.816477 0.341591 -0.086094 -0.849203 0.706137 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.448217 0.076054 -0.337085 0.745413 1.391499 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.280685 4.985055 4.521327 4.544654 4.903597 4.850605,2144
"so i'm sitting here typing about whatever is on my mind. well, a whole lot is on my mind right now, like what the hell am i supposed to do about my car. good lord, that's all i needed, my care to really mess up on me. but anyway, right now, i'm really missing my girlfriend. she is all that consumes my thoughts, so a random progression of my subconscious thoughts will most likely be all about her. i really know how much she means to me now that i went back home to see her. enough about liz. thinking consciously about her will just make me very sad. i was thinking about acid the other day, you know, lsd. i was told that lewis carroll, author of ""alice in wonderland"", was having one hell of a trip when he wrote the book. that would explain some of the messed up things that he wrote about, but i think that if he had tapped into his own subconscious, he would have been able to write about the same stuff. i mean, lsd allows you to see things that you normally would not see on your own, but i think that deep within your own consciousness, that is what you would really see. for example, i have a friend that said that the ceiling looked like it was dripping, due to all of the little bumps on it from paint. if you look at a ceiling like that long enough, with a clear head, i believe that you would see the exact same thing. i guess that the only reason this kind of pisses me off is that there are so many people that believe that really messed up art, music, and literature can only be created by some one who is having one really wicked trip or who is on some drug or stimulant of some kind. that is complete bs because when i write, or draw, or create music that's really screwed up, i tend to always do it in a clear frame of mind. it really makes me mad that some people believe art comes from being fucked up when all the time it comes from the heart (where it should come from) or the inner recesses of one's mind. i don't want people to think that all the art i create comes from drug abuse when it really comes from my own tormented mind. the absence of the love of your life can lead to some really messed up art. i've written some of the most depressing work i've ever written lately because of that absence. if it were humanly possible, financially etc. , i would marry that girl in a heartbeat because i think the only way for me to be completely happy is to be with her. the drumming in my head is beginning to start. how quaint for the artistic flow to arrive just as i am planning to leave the site. the drumming will continue the rest of my evening.

" i'm really not sure what exactly i am suppossed to write about so i thought i would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's september 11th. that morning i woke up and things didn't seem any different. i put on my i love new york shirt and went to class. truthfully, i was very dissapointed with the people here at ut and how they acted that day. people in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. the tower played american songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. it was getting in the way of our discussion. whatever!! we should have been discussing september 11!! one girl in the class said, who cares!! people die every day!! we kill people in afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!! i personally was outraged by that comment. how disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. that night i went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. we stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. it was awesome. to be standing there next to my friends, people that i loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. to hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. and then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. the whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. it was very powerful. you couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in new york who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but wanting to go in anyways. i had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. and in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. at the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. i forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. in almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. you couldn't help it. then the whole crowd sang god bless america. hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing god bless america was absolutely amazing. i knelt down where i was and said a prayer to thank god for my family and my friends and for the fact that was so blessed. i picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that i love her. my family is the most important thing in the world to me and if i lost any of them i don't know how i could even go on. when it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. it made me think about the pictures i had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. a very powerful sight. the man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in pearl harbor on december 7th. that was an amazing thought to me also. it was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great american tragedy. however, this was a tragedy but not just that. in fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. i saw a commericial that gave me the chills. it was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking american city. the voice in the background said on september 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change america forever. the screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. the same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. in the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. the voice said they succeeded. i think that is a perfect way to say what september 11 has done for america. yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in america are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. at this point in my life, i am very proud to be an american.

"my eyes are closed right now and i'm wondering if i'm doing things correctly. i just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. i wish i was there with her right now to talk everything out. its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. i am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. i want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. i'm just very exhausted. i've been going nonstop this entire weekend. just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as i type words on this keyboard. i feel it in my neck and the back. i just want to go to sleep. . but i must go on if i'm going to finish all my assignments. i'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. i think i'm going to do my psychology tonight. and here i am. i'm tired but i don't want to sleep. i don't want my weekend to end. it's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . if i don't sleep yet, maybe i could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. i've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. now i am wondering whether i'm doing this right. how can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. i'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think i'm insane after reading this. i rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. how can we truly define that word? i think everyone has a little insanity in them. just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term insane pretty difficult and complicated. it's not like there is a standard of being sane. everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? i think its amazing how i wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. i have another thought. my uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. are they insane? how could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them? i wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the ideal normal i don't think they do because schizophrenia is their normal. besides, who is to judge the ideal normal? i read a book by timothy findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own? i guess this question is a double edged sword. take from it what you will. i still have no idea. anyway, am i doing this correctly? oh here's another thought. . how do you know if i'm doing this correctly. it's my stream of consciousness. whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. for me i think it's normal. i write these kind of thoughts in a journal. i think the only reason why i'm sort of unsure is that i'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment. i am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. i'm actually kind of relaxed now. more sleepy. i think my 20 minutes is up.

"ok, ummm, i'm hungry. just got out of psych class and i was hoping to go home, but must turn this writing assignment in before friday. the lie detector presentation was interesting. sadly i started nodding off around the part where dr. pennebaker was talking about dopamine and schizophrenia and parkinsons. i was never completely asleep, just in and out of consciousness. man, my typing skills are really sucky. anyway, ricky's in my head. he is turning 19 on september 24. i always think he and chelsea should be together because chelsea wants it that way. wanted. she says she is over him, but i don't know. i am excited about the garlic toast i'm going to make with andrea's tuna casserole. yes, my roommate is also andrea. she is the more prominent andrea. totally super smart, super pretty, super nice. i could totally jealous. no, envious because she has what i don't have, she is not taking what i used to have. yeah, i could totally envy her, but it's just not so. she is a blessing. so. i need to make a bracelet for jodi. hopefully she is doing ok. and why is kirk still in my head? we weren't even super friends, just very casual acquaintances, but he manages to pop back in my head after three years. great job kirk. actually, i think i like thinking about him. or the idea that i have of him. i don't really know him so i can only entertain the ideas that i have of the hypothetical kirk. and i feel old. and worn out. and everytime i'm close to the edge of the sidewalk and a big bus passes by, i somewhat regret that i didn't fall or stumble into its path. i'm not suicidal, but the drama that comes with saying or writing these things is fun. i could die so easily. if death came right now, i'd go with him. even more so if he was cute. but i have too many people to be responsible to. not just friends and family but everyone who i've told that life is good. where am i going with this? i don't know. but it's more interesting than an itchy foot, no? so biology is making me feel anxious. hard professor, dr. edmiston, but i like it that way because it's like a battle or a contest. you get through, if i get that a, then it's going to be so cool because it's such a hard-ass class. andrea's hardass class is physics, but hers is plan ii so it's probably triple the intensity of my biology class. i'm glad i have something to work for, something to worry about because it was too easy at uta (arligton). i was not' challenged so i slacked off. worked more and got more money, yeah, but wasted time and money on classes that i liked but weren't going towards nursing. oh well. i tell andrea i feel like a gray crayon here in austin. but i don't feel that all the time, just when i realize how gray i am compared to others. i'm thinking of what to type so this is probably only partial stream-of-consciousness, and not because i have something to hide but i'm better at writing. my thinking and writing speeds are almost the same. or, that's not good, i can slow my thinking to my writing speed but not to my typing speed. and i just want to go to sleep and not wake up. an eternal darkness, but i wouldn't know because i'd be asleep. but then if i ever wake up on the other side i'd feel guilty leaving people behind. so that was twenty minutes? yeah, if you want to see more stream-of-consciousness just ask to see my blue notebook. i usually sit front and center and no more than three rows back. but who would care? but it's there. ok, bye!

"i am wondering why i decided to wear this shirt today. no i'm not. i kow why i did. i wanted to look nice. gosh! why do people keep sending me messages? i put my away message on. wow, i can type pretty fast, but i'm getting distracted because i'm wiggling in the chair and my ponytail is tickling the back of my neck. i hear voices outside - what are the girls in my dorm doing? the door just slammed, so i guess they just got home from class. hope they're not doing anything fun without me. ouch, my stomach kind of hurts. i guess i'm not under that much stress because (darn, i always mess up because"" when i type!) i think i might be getting sick. i really liked that lecture. i learned so much! my neck is kind of tense now, and i hate typing for too long. i type much too fast, or rather i think much too quickly. it's only been 3 minutes. this writing assignment will be a long one, i'm sure. i'm kind of worried about running for rhc vice president. i hate elections, i hate campaigning. everytime i run for an election, someone always tries to do something really underhanded, like spread rumors or tear down posters or just do something really mean. gosh, this folder on my desk is really in the way and i think the fan in this room is much too loud. i wish my roommate was her - i'm kind of lonely. i would like to go to dinner, but i think i'll wait until she gets home. but if she is not back soon, i'm going to eat a cookie from the pantry to tide me over. speaking of tide, laundry accumulates much too quickly in college. i've had to wash a ton of clothes since i've gotten here, and it's way too expensive. pkus, our washers and dryers don't work right, so i don't think that they're ever really clean. gosh, i worry too much about my punctuation and grammar. i really doubt whether i sound intelligent in these essays - the structure is not right, the grammar most likely isn't, and the spelling is constantly corrected. there's a blinking light telling me that i have an i'm, but i don't want to answer it. i'm trying to type! go away! gosh, there's another message. leave me alone. nooooo!my neck still hurts too. i could really go for a massage. i keep thinking about today's lecture. it really made me feel so much better. i'm so glad dr. pennebaker told us that everyone feels kind of stupid and lonely when they first get to college. i know i do. now the phone's ringing. grrrr. i guess i'm not that lonely after all. i really like the new people that i have met in college and i think that the classes are really interesting, but everyone in my fig seems to absorb info much faster than i do. i mean, i'm a smart girl, but i have to read and read to understand information. my parents are like that too. they don't understand what they read right off the bat. they have to read it two or three times ot really understand it. i really like having examples or analogies for the stuff i read. it helps to illustrate the point. i don't understand. grrr, the fan is still too loud. just plain definitions. i need more than that. the sun is really bright. i wish my desk didn't face the window. i really wish that we had a better view from the window. all i see when i look outside is a brick wall. c'mon, a brick wall? that's hardly a view. and the girl next door just left to go to the gym or something. she always wears a ton of keys on a lanyard around her neck, so she jingles wherever she goes. darn! i don't remember the names of the boys i just met outside. they were really nice when my friend introduced me, but they were from nigeria and had really foreign names. one was like something with an f, i think. and the other. who knows? yay! my birthday is on friday. i can't wait to see what surprises are in store for me. i want to go out and have tons of fun with all my new friends, and then i want to go home and see my family. i really miss them. my mom sends me a card like everyday. i can't believe i left my keys in san antonio the last time i went home. my mom finally sent them to me today in a card, which was a relief. haha, i sighed just now, which i guess truly illustrates how relieved i was. i really want to get more mail. college students should set up some sort of program, like a buddy thing, where they could get more mail. the mailbox hardly ever has anything in it, but today i got a magazine. cool. and someone just sent me an i'm, but i don't know who it was. i'm almost done. i can answer them! i think i'll do that right now, and answer the other ims too. haha i guess people do love me! :) yay!

"ok, i guess i really don't know where to start. i just got out of my ba101 class, which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began. i guess maybe i should have stayed longer, but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open, and trying to make friends with everyone around them, that i couldn't stand it for very much longer. this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though i'm writing all of this on one very long line, i'm wondering if there is some way i can go about fixing it after this is all over, because it is really annoying and it seems as though i'm not writing anything. i don't know what i'm going to do tonight, it's too late to call my boyfriend, he lives overseas, and there is a seven hour time change. i hope everything is going well with him, because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it. if only i was still in france that way i would know that everything was going well with him. this is a really huge box that i'm writing in because the wrap around just came into affect. very strange, very very strange. i guess i'm at a point where i don't exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank. my friend once told me that he never stops thinking, that at all times he is thinking about something, and when you are talking to him, that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with him. that worries me, because sometimes i see i'm smile for no apparent reason when we are talking, and i just know that the last thirty words that i have just said, he is paying absolutely no attention to. my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds, that's not saying that i'm not. but my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in. maybe that's why i'm taking psych instead of sociology, it's because i'm trying to figure out who these people are and why i chose them as my friends. it could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat i've recently gotten into. my boyfriend is really into existentialism, and so the only thing i've been reading as of late has been kundera and sartre. but then of course i must be honest, i'm taking this course because it is located close to my other class on tuesday thursday, and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well. not to mention my friends who have taken soc, told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take. i hope i get a good grade in this class, after this last semester, my grades are suffering, i literally dropped my gpa by . 4 over this last summer semester, which should indicate that i really didn't do very well. but i only have 35 hours, so if i do well this semester, i can bring my gpa back up over 3. 5 and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again. it's not like they aren't nice now, but they are ""really disappointed how i handled last semester"" that is ""considering that we sent you to france last you, you could at least try a little harder"" this would all be said in the james earl jones low god-like voice that i always get in my head whenever my dad is yelling at me. i probably get that in my head, because my dad yelling at me reminds me of darth vader when he's mad at the corporals, and james earl jones is the voice of darth vader, do you see the connection? anyway, so i'm trying to make my grades appear somewhat better, because if i do, they will probably let me go on the intensive french study program i want to go to next summer. and then i can see my boyfriend he is so cute. i miss him a lot. i tend to think about him most when i'm either lonely or bored in class. that only either maker me more distracted from the work i should be doing, or even sadder about being all alone. if only he could be american, my life would be so much simpler. have i been writing for twenty minutes yet, i swear i've been writing for decades, and my hands are starting to get lazy, and tired, and i really don't want all these people around me in the computer room, and i wish that i had had the time to take a shower this morning, because i think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell. i have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now, because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving, granted they were here before i even started this little assignment, into the mind of the student at the university of texas. i'm starting to think i'm going to end this pretty soon, because that is the only thing i can think of right now, is when am i going to end this assignment. i think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant. but you said that it didn't matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes. so here i am my twenty minutes complete, and i am saying good bye and thank god this is over. only one more to go.

" 311, i never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, im supposed to be typing instead of talking to arturo. man, this song is so melodic and soothing. it reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. sometimes i wonder why people are the way they are. it's quite complex and difficult, but i'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. i truly believe that social qualities mean a lot. people need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this adan. the song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, tool. music, is a language everyone can speak. you can't go wrong with music. it's a huge part of my life. wow, aenima ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. aenima is an interesting song about armageddon. speaking of armageddon, is god going to come to earth, or jesus for that matter. biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. and for what? to not sin and go to heaven? there are so many religions out there, i mean, controversy is going to be a given. why is john reading this. is he interested in what is on my mind. well anyway, respect for other's religions is something i find extremely important and essential to understand at the university of texas at austin. instead of looking at a muslim and saying holy shit what's up with that just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. live, and let live. have respect. i feel as though people close to me in my home in rockport do not realize the respect i have for them. they never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 1 sec please. alright some middle time afi, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. they are one of my favorite punk bands. sometimes i wonder what the lives of davey havok and afi are like. they seem as though they are really nice people. having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. yeah bob marley, a legend. now thats good stuff. i mean who doesnt like bob marley? his music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. you just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. buffalo soldier in a war for america. bob marley used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. who dies from cannibus? is it really that bad? should we legalize it? nevada's police force seems more concerned with other crimes than marijuana. personally, i believe marijuana is better ",1,-0.25731 -1.114858 -0.729499 -0.813028 -1.067701 1.785939 2.259406 1.919993 1.993273 -0.628312 -0.213088 1.240984 1.729286 -1.690696 1.810318 0.0 -0.04277 -1.849437 -2.703505 0.478727 -2.723491 1.114565 0.786358 0.533452 0.811144 0.252588 0.508718 -0.518039 -0.493931 0.040645 -0.630848 -1.430891 -0.746262 -0.350771 -0.640442 -1.109326 -0.725536 -0.28815 -0.322884 -1.697937 0.47951 -0.10727 -0.431398 0.883784 0.715385 0.581162 0.53689 1.266775 0.76507 1.241496 1.005475 -2.231135 -0.747835 -0.25369 -0.850826 -1.412694 -1.403932 -0.954251 1.062095 -0.950161 -0.777336 -1.197492 4.323535 -0.198792 -0.003357 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.381996 1.043071 -0.073676 0.876018 1.602349 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.48644 0.765054 -0.049355 0.590558 4.429688 3.364528 4.69604 3.94699 5.650638,1721
"at the present time, i am content to be writing. it's almost time to go to sleep, and this is very relaxing. i am listening to eminem on mtv. i do not like eminem. i hate to cough. i am coughing because of this stupid dorm room and some studid mold that they think is just the paint doing wierd things. i think that my throat is doing better though, the medication is kicking in finally after about 6 days of torturous soreness. i just talked to jonathan, he is the greates guy in the world. but i don't want him to think that i am the only girl in the world for him. i think that it is funny that a lot of girls thought are about boys. i just want to have fun this year, and not have a boyfriend. i think it is important to just meet people and have connections with each person you come in contact, but they don't have to be any thing more than at that moment. its really late, i wish that i wouldn't put things off till the last minute. i have had such a long day, and am ready for bed. my bed feels so good. i love the fact that i am so comfortable in my dorm with my roomates. they are so great, and fun to be with. chaps is my roommate. i think that name is kind of different, but she like it so i just call her that. i love this song by michelle branch. she ironically is talking about saying goodbye to a boyfriend. that is what i have had to do for the past year. it was incredibly hard. but i hated the way he acted when he left for college my senior year. i felt so guilty for wanting more out of my senior year than having a boyfriend 300 miles away. he wanted more, and i feel so bad. he has some self-confidence issues. i think the fact that i actually was dating him was great for the self - confidence thing. but once we separated, it just hit him so hard. we are really good friends, but i really think he still wants more. someday, i might also, but not now. i love that the zeta's symbol is the strawberry and the queen. it is so exciting. i am so excited about organizing my new member book. i love organizing. it almost gives me some kind of high. to be totally organized, and know where everything is. i need that kind of stability in my life, because i do so much and stretch myself in so many difections. i don't know how i am going to do sororities, get my gpa up to at least a 3. 8, and do two organizations outside of school, (which is required by zeta sorority). but i perform best under pressure, so the more the merrier. i am so excited about texas spirits, that is the organization that i hope to join, as my organization to have to join. jessica is in texas spirits, and i love her. she was the person that made my decision for zeta tau alpha so concrete in my mind. i dreamed that i was a zeta the night before i found out which one picked me. i think it was a sign or something. jessica means so much to me, but she is always too busy with katie johnson. today, she did give me a card with a picture of us in it saying that she is sorry she hasn't been there to hang out with me as much as she wanted to. zeta is going to be so awesome to be a part of. i love the friends that i have made so far. i just really think that the parties that are involved are a little too numbered throughout the week, i mean they want us to get good grades, and be in all these organizations. yet they give us all these mixers to go to to meet people which i love to do, but they are on week nights. oh well, i just am going to have to limit my participation in them. i miss my high school friends. i haven't talk to rosie in ages, and casey didn't even say goodbye before she left. i am going to have to send them an email pretty soon. the sound of the mouse and keyboard are such wierd noises. and so are the sounds that come out of the actual computer. i always have wondered what makes the little clicking noises in the computer. i mean is it gears shifting, or electrons being shot out of some kind of machine. i want to know. that is interesting. and i am glad to be done.

"i think that the only reason college is as hard as everyone says it is is because they do not want to look dumb in front of other people. i came here thinking that i was in for it but all my classes seem not too difficult with a little bit of reading and work, but then again when people ask me how it is i can pretty much, no clearly see myself saying it is really hard you are in for it. i hate how, no i like the fact that my brother knows a million people no really by a million i mean a million but a cannot stand the fact that when i meet them for some reason after i am introduced by my name and then a relation of his people do this kind of weird double take and say oh you are his sister as if they have or had heard many of incidents and or events involving me it makes me a little uncomfortable more so with the males than the females though sometimes i think that the whole world does in fact revolve around the way people look (although when asked the whole world denies it) as if they do not judge or insinuate on the appearance of others i wonder what people think of me i have been told many of times that i fit the idealistic look of that of a rich snob, almost brat like appearance which is then reversed though my personality i would have never thought people would think of stuff like that about me i am highly, no i would say extremely satisfied with myself appearance, social class, and moralistic views though in the least conceited manner possible i do not understand sometimes the way males think though especially after a few or more drinks i cannot wait until i can buy my elephant a real live circus if you will in my own back yard i am starting to think though that i might have to settle for an elephant shaped pool instead i have never really believed in love at first sight or that someone was ""made"" or ""meant to be"" for you you just find someone you can make it work with otherwise why do so many people get divorced and remarried multiple times before or ever finding the right person it irritates me that people think that you are interested in them in a relationship type of manner when you simply look at them, i look at everybody if the door opens i turn around and see who walked in i highly dislike immature people and seem not to understand why certain people are the way that they are i mean i know experiences and relationships have shaped their past but i have many faults in my past and have dealt with or lived with the one person i actually can say i hate i am the least bit negative though and am equally open to everyone that is introduced to my knowledge i like being open minded it enables people as well as myself to look at views and people in an entirely almost inhuman perspective i recently also noticed that nothing really stresses me out or makes me scared or nervous i never stress out why bother stressing about it which also wastes valuable time when the time can be using in a calm cool manner completing the task i just as similarly cannot think of anything that makes me nervous or scared i do not have a problem talking to extremely large audiences nor am i afraid of death i do not understand why people pass out bibles on campus either although i am not christian i went to a catholic school which helped me learn to respect other religions as well as traditions and practices so i cannot throw the bible away and i do not want to leave it anywhere because it is the word of someone else's supreme being ",0,0.063574 -0.369158 -1.228739 -0.59709 -0.380077 -0.406443 2.070338 1.404704 1.338717 0.004058 3.127289 -0.590446 -0.266383 0.724807 1.005535 0.0 -0.04277 -0.276389 -0.397032 -0.795527 -0.633129 1.119163 -0.46991 4.023864 -0.624052 0.809943 0.420291 -0.396186 -0.23154 -1.073033 -0.747322 -0.741531 0.851079 3.26871 0.117399 -1.109326 0.482615 0.568214 1.82935 -0.891599 0.102771 0.617963 0.145787 1.406057 2.440882 1.11869 -1.093488 0.765903 0.555716 0.055073 3.453816 -0.575574 -0.262857 1.072786 -0.848722 -1.19802 -1.041304 -0.954251 0.125045 1.226272 -1.284354 -0.691946 2.228609 -0.334379 -0.138217 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.283448 -0.785311 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.97766 -1.585528 0.463164 -0.138542 -2.427744 3.816509 4.962864 4.103381 4.369906 5.247537,1408
"stream of consciousness---i am not sure what to write at all everything in my head comes in little spurts of information. ""turn the radio on, turn the radio up, and this woman was singing my song, lover is crying cause the other won't stay. my stomach hurts and i have to go to the bathroom, i think i just saw jacob biddle now that i have to think about something i can't. which is strange because usually i think too much about everything right now that song by lisa loeb keeps running through my head even though i really hate that song. i feel really bad for princess diana's kids. but i actually have that morbid curiosity to see the pictures of the accident scene and it makes me feel awful. do i have to work tomorrow? my bangs keep getting in my face---i should never have gotten them my roommate is bothering me right now. she always leaves hair on the bathroom sink and on the floor and it really disgusts me, especially in the morning when i am already in a bad mood, and sometimes she gets this real high moral attitude with me like she knows better and doesn't want to break the rules by painting the walls because mr. lay might get mad, yet she has all this pot in her closet what a hypocrite! i hope i make texas angels, although i have to admit that i thought the whole thing was really fake okay, now really nothing is going through my head i wonder if the people next to me are looking at what i am writing, they better not, that is such an invasion of privacy, although i would look at theirs any day. there is this disk sitting right here and it is not mine but i want to use it because i didn't bring a disk so that i could check email but i don't even know whether or not it is formatted for a pc, that guy was really cute. i wish i was in paris right now. wow these computers really filled up fast ---there is already a line to get on them oh well too bad for them. oh damn i forgot to go get that course packet for government, oh i need to call that new york times number i think they changed the computer system here in the smf because the setup is different, that guy reminds me of somebody but i can't think who, i wonder if i can check my email without a disk if that is brian patridge he sure got fat. i wonder if i need to bring my psychology book today, but i don't think i have time to walk all the way home and then walk back, i will just share with tina i need to check on my stocks, maybe they have finally earned me some money, and i need to get my portfolio going. i want my car back ",1,-0.624167 1.138079 -0.039668 0.320044 0.105921 -0.074571 0.350148 0.332781 0.569921 -0.609379 0.088669 0.253448 0.794303 0.299481 -0.017437 0.0 -0.04277 0.21695 0.662912 -0.795527 0.485195 -0.742368 0.239513 0.510225 0.086524 0.218313 -0.490625 -0.99949 -0.234322 -0.948341 -1.100231 -0.522986 0.501043 -0.906028 0.477336 -0.116193 0.111628 -0.304785 0.444717 0.969708 -1.038726 -0.133674 0.199624 -0.95419 0.269611 -1.192147 -0.286275 -0.414038 -0.396792 -0.1833 0.3169 -0.434125 -0.761265 1.512073 -0.85914 -0.389438 0.727613 -0.954251 0.001957 0.296776 0.65032 -0.404027 0.709012 -0.204138 -0.008675 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.427703 0.542695 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.243066 -0.124422 2.214696 0.038668 -0.733431 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.703262 4.820424 4.529985 4.572246 4.744361 4.592573,85

"well, here goes. i'm in my room right now and it's very warm. my housing is not air conditioned. i'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. i tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes i was kicked off. i was beyond pissed. my ankle is itching. yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and i sat in the grass. for some reason that makes my leg itch. i wind is blowing in my room and it feels good. i am very tired and want to go back to sleep. i took an hour nap awhile ago. matt came down. i hear people talking in the alley. one of them is a guy. i wish matt could stay here with me in austin. i miss him so much. i'm so pathetic. the tissue on my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. i need to call my tutors one day. i need one in math more than anything else. i'm not stupid or anything, i just need assistance on the problems sometimes. doug say's that i don't have a life. that i has no personality. that made my confidence soar. i know i didn't have a life, but i really couldn't help it. my parents are super, super strict and i wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. even now that i can i'm restricted to because of my boyfriend matt. he cam down tonight. i love him so much. he should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. he's mad at doug because doug wouldn't leave us alone today. i was kind of mad too. doug doesn't like the thought of me and matt spending time together. he's weird like that. matt should be nicer to his parents. they both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so i will too. matt is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. at least i had a close family. matt doesn't even think that his parents love him. i know they do but he doesn't think that they do. he still sees himself and their mistake. i don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. i'm going back home on october 4th. matt's birthday is on that weekend. saturday will be a lot of fun. after that i'll be going to the renaissance festival with matt and doug. we're going to camp down there. it'll be a lot of fun. doug can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. maybe he'll find himself a girlfriend by then. then he'll be happy. i think. he didn't seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into amanda. i didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one listened to me. i like my room it's nice. i live at the women's co-ops. they are cool. all the girls in the house have made me feel completely welcome. i've been typing for about ten minutes. i think that's pretty good. if y'all read this y'all will have a lot to read. i'm trying to type slow so this won't get too long. i'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. doug liked elyssa. he'd like to have her legs wrapped around him. he is very crass. then again matt can be that way too. he is rarely rude to me though. i'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. i'm used to being protected. it's weird being down here knowing that i can actually be hurt. that is scary. my guys live two and a half hours away. we won the football game today. the tower is lit up. i love ut. i love the freedom i acquired when i came down here. it's not that i'm partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. i just like that fact that i can if i want too. i don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. i've even been studying more down here than i did at home. i've kept up with all of my classes so far. i'll be doing some of my homework tomorrow. i read the assigned readings in between classes. the written assignments that actually take time get done at home. i have a quiz in math monday. my foot hurts. it's been reclining against the chair too long. my hand hurts too. it's resting on the edge of my desk. i am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. my legs are sweaty against the seat. the back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. matt left his bobo feit action figure with me. he's the bounty hunter from star wars. i'm very surprised because he's very important to matt. i am honored that he did. it's on my desk right next to my pewter angel'moon and stars figurine. i got that with matt in florida. we went to disney with the school marching band during spring break. the figurine cost me seventy bucks. it was definitely worth it. i've been typing for a little over twenty minutes. bye.

"i am so stressed out right now with all these school stuff. today i was so frustrated with my course schedule because i needed a fine arts credit. at the beginning, i signed up for art history, but i just found out that the class didn't work out for me. i didn't want something that hard to deal with since i am not even majoring in art. therefore, i decided to try the music department. i called in, and the lady who worked at the office told me that the music appreciation class was still opened. she told me to go all the way to the building mrh just to fill out the green card in order to add the class. so, i decided to drop my art history class right away. in the afternoon, i rushed over there. by the time when i got there, one of the lady told me that i needed to talk to the professor first before i could fill out the green card. plus, the time of the class she offered me interfered with my original schedule. i was so upset about this when i left the building because i really needed one more class in order to be fill up my hours. when i got back to my dorm, i immediately called my college of education for help. the guy told me to go to see the advisors in the next morning. he also told me not to worry too much today about it. i knew i shouldn't drop my art history class that quickly. i should have waited to see if i could be added to another class. right now, i consider to take piano as my fine arts credit during the next semester because i have a little knowledge with piano but i am required to sign up on the waiting list first. the class can only fill up 15 students. instead of taking the fine art class in this semester, i decided to take chinese instead. besides, i need a foreign language credit. tomorrow i will need to see that professor to see if i am allowed to be in that class. hopefully, i can. i have been worried about this over the whole day. i wish everything can work out fine tomorrow.

"i don't know what to expect. by best friend's father passed away monday and i am really worried about the family. his mother does not work and he is in college without much financial aid. i hope he will be able to continue school, but i don't know what's going to happen. i am scared to face them, though. i can't see the family being whole without the father. they were always so close to one another and could share anything with each other. i envied that relationship because my family was broken up at an early age. when my father and mother divorced, i was only about two or three. i actually don't even know when they divorced. i really can't even picture my parents being together at all. they are so different now. i guess that is why i was envious of my friend's family. i never have had a very close relationship with any members of my family. i feel alone inside my parents house. when i went to my friend's house, though, they were always so open with each other and there was never any tension or anxiety between them. i don't see how a family like that could be torn apart, or actually why. some people think there's a reason for everything, and some people believe that it's all a part of god's plan, but i, personally, have no idea what reason or higher purpose there could be for this man's death. maybe there isn't any reason. maybe humans have a natural tendency to search for reasons, causes, purpose. are we all just misleading ourselves? could it be that humans are merely just another species on the face of this planet? who knows. james' father knows. he has all the answers to all the questions in life. it's funny that the questions of life are only found in death. he is dead, nevertheless, and i still can't come to that realization. traumatic experiences just never happen to me or people i know. until now, i guess. what the hell happened? five minutes to go. i remember just before i left, coming back to austin for my second year, shaking his hand, and hearing him wish me luck. how can that man be dead? then i remember that death is a part of living; death is the price tag of life. we all have to face it sometime, and i guess it's not going to happen at our convenience. we have to prepare ourselves for anything, but how? i don't know of any way i could have prepared for this. if i would have known that he was going to die, i would have tried to stop it from happening. i would have wanted him to keep on living. why is that? if death is so common, why do humans try so hard to prevent it, rather prolong it from happening? i can't say that it's selfishness, i wouldn't want him to live just so i could live happy. but that is a part of it. but, the answer awaits me as well. i guess i'll have to prepare myself for my death. that means i better start living my life.

"the complete works of shakespere is a very large book and although i've skimmed through king lear and hamlet and a little bit of the old twelfth night, i reckon it would take me about a year and a half reading every day to get through that whole book. i'm glad i could change my schedule during add'drop because getting up at eight just would have not happened at all. sexie sady, she lastest and the greatest of them all. did you know the world was waiting just for you oo ooo sexie sady or sadie, however big you think you are areaeaereare. you'll get yours yet. abby's massage to the alternative take to this song. all those weird little encounters. this assignment better be like confidential. a man's thoughts word for word over twenty minutes by definition should be filled with nasty gutter talk and such, but for the sake of the grader, this stream of continuous mental blabber shall be filtered convieniently for filthynesses sake. helter skelter would you want me to make you? tell me tell me tell me the answer helter skelter helter skelter helter skelter ooooooo! aw here she come! nice slide guitar work ther, george, when i get to the botom i go back to the top of the slide do you don't you want me to make you? comin dowm fast but don't let me break you. you may be a lover, but you aint no dancer. helter skelter helter skelter look out! arpeggio arpeggio arpeggio (slide guitar guitar guitar) this is fun. noise, and back into the song once more. once more. hahahaha. next cut, fellows. it's not necessary to go on for say fifteen minutes. now a nice quiet one. no one will ever read this. time to change the announcement on my answering machine. i'll have my computer do it again, but in a differnt voice than that man voice named bill or whatever. i must go junda hu's office hours today and hand in me homework, lest i be penalized. where is rlm? where will i go after that. will i take a shower. yes. will i wear my pledge pin or on the same plane, will i wear a collard shirt around campus this afternoon. i've had a pleasant and not so well deserved morning lounging around the room while my good buddy went off to an 8oclock class this morning. too bad for him, although i probably should have ittited off to junda hu's. we go over stuff that i know too well already, but the homework definately should have been put up then. after pledge line i probably will not make class in the morning friday, but i know that i really should go. that would be a very terrible habit to fall into although i know many upperclassmen that not only do not go to class on a whim, but sell back half their newly bought books like brent right at the beginning of the semester just for full retail reimbursement and on hopes to just wing it all from the course packets and what not. i'ts funny when people in conversation use ""and whatnot. "" it really says a lot about tha speaka and grabs the attention of the listener because that little turn of the tongue is not too oftern used any more. the directions said not to pay attention to sentence structure and such a dn that is good because right now i am mayor of run-on city. i suppose those who waste the time to right all this down on paper first and transcribe their stuff will pretty it up a bit and the experiment will be botched like that. enough. i used to do this kind of stuff in 6th grade en ",1,-0.504171 -0.197305 -1.535391 -0.555359 -1.074273 1.380876 1.288951 2.376941 0.68751 -0.098181 -0.1465 0.410452 1.120098 -1.165652 0.880378 0.0 -0.04277 -2.295739 -1.891933 -0.546002 -2.14317 2.651469 -0.843406 1.081495 -0.061971 1.665578 -0.370014 0.383253 -1.238346 -0.701346 -0.732572 -0.712719 -1.021972 -0.471106 -0.426554 -1.109326 -1.160459 -1.189255 -1.109854 0.103456 -0.444123 -0.824176 -0.273611 -0.392018 -0.421489 0.675408 -0.774226 -0.394036 0.205373 -0.11773 -0.557286 0.194256 -1.04529 -1.074384 2.070772 0.854977 1.541446 1.039781 0.184924 0.161567 1.019657 -0.338605 -0.480161 0.538776 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.435153 -0.082188 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.25777 0.215627 -0.112805 0.306952 -0.464732 0.501395 0.154278 -0.380135 4.187062 3.951753 4.312363 4.291901 5.089152,999
"right now i'm thinking about how i don't want to do this i just want to get to new mexico and start hunting. this is the fifteenth year me and my dad have been doing this. it all started when i was 3 i can remember my first time of course i didn't shoot anything that year just kind of watched but it was still fun. i'm also excited that my best bud justin gets to go with us i met him at church camp my freshman year of high school. he's not from kerrville he's from boerne but after that first year we were always kicking it together every weekend. we have had some fun times parties, going wakeboarding at the lake, snow skiing, spring break at south padre. its all good. well back to hunting now, its a good drive and here i am stuck doing my homework instead of driving in the car, i wish i had a lap top then i could do this while i was driving. i almost got one, but my dad changed his mind and got me the box. i'm not complaining because i have a burner and did and its real fast and all but a lap top just seems more versatile. dang how long is twenty minutes. when your sleeping twenty minutes goes by so fast but when your doing homework or sitting in some boring class, it takes forever. funny how that works. any way i wish the twenty minutes was over and it almost is just a few more minutes left. at least this was an easy assignment, not some hardcore 235346 page essay you wanted typed out single spaced font size of 9. i have to do one of those for english and i haven't even thought about. i'm a procrastinator it will probably be the night before and i hadn't even started on it, oh man i just got a big time hunger for ice cream, chocolate ice cream that is. after this maybe ill go get some, i hope you don't take off for grammar or are expecting proper english in this thought page. because i'm just writing what comes to me and my thoughts move faster than i write so its kind of hard because i have so many thoughts yet my hands can only go so fast. dang there are a lot of hot chicks at ut i'm glad that me and the girl i was dating from home decided to date other people before we went away to school, because i would be a bad boy and want to mess around on her, but i'm not like that, i have real guilty conscience. any way back to those hot chick, dang so many girls and only 4 years of college to get to know them all. i hope i can fit them all in to my busy schedule, you right like they would give me the time of day well actually a real hot chick asked me the time but that's about all she would give me dang like i said twenty minutes is a long time and the clock is going very slowly i swear it hasn't moved since i started. now i'm thinking about ""what's going through my mind what can i type to take up space maybe i should just start typing long words but then i wouldn't spell them right so its no use. any way back to school and back to this 20 minute writing assignment. i don't know what to right, i'm drawing a blank, dang its like my mind is running black. well now i'm worried about not having enough crap packed. i can't wait to go to new mexico, its my favorite trip of the year, its all i can think about right now because i'm leaving right after i finish this. only a few more minutes. i'm going home and i can't wait to see my dog. of all the people at my house to miss, i can't wait to see my dog, he probably doesn't care but oh well, i can't wait to see him.

" i am excited about being a columnist, not because i like the daily texan particularly, although i do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since i can go on to write for the dmn or the statesman once i am out of college and i can get internships at newspapers during the summer so it will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, i'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, i don't know if i can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, i don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but i obviously can't leave them behind and i think i want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean i actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but i still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but i can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all i can do is leave my options open so i can make good decisions later, so basically all i can do is write as well as i can and make good grades, i don't know exactly how to do either but i do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means i need to go to the utlc finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well i can do on my own, i'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, i'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as i love going to ut home games, an away game means that i can eat while i'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, i can watch it with whoever i want and i don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, i would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, i don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so i don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, i'm a little worried about what i look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot i can do about that before the next game but i'll do what i can, i'm bored with classes already, i havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since i am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so i can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more i do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, i've never lived by myself before and i havent lived away from home for that long, i've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since i don't live in a dorm anymore, i miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so i guess the solution to that is to get things done while i'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, i need to get some groceries, i don't think i know how to shop yet, i still havent made a grocery list longer than 12 items and that's not enough when i go to the store once a week at most, i'm sure things will get easier once i get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but i'm anxious to get to the point where i am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management ",1,0.351427 -0.658697 0.637094 -1.164481 -1.222755 -0.277701 0.039252 0.411775 0.548649 0.662935 12.86633 -0.590446 -0.940728 -0.721831 0.124974 0.0 -0.04277 -1.156268 -0.119592 -0.224595 -0.18666 -0.742368 -0.912023 0.388118 -0.195357 0.847774 0.813512 -0.615997 -0.361694 -0.242081 -0.81982 -0.335402 -0.245092 0.420819 -0.792429 -0.210582 -0.584708 0.246166 -0.967081 -0.019935 -0.131728 -1.395166 0.081986 -1.308387 -0.148154 -1.33119 -0.606492 -0.73255 -1.474675 -1.252113 0.058378 -0.614443 -1.546405 1.091156 -0.177728 -1.085432 -0.403542 -0.447307 0.662719 -0.002468 -0.203585 0.083642 -0.480161 -0.418775 -0.222159 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.387564 1.569627 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.455052 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.918643 4.26996 4.352247 4.990734 4.83849 5.363624,2422
" well, apparently i'm supposed to just type for 20 minutes. being that it is september 11, i suppose it would a good topic. everywhere i look i see something about 9'11. even the clock at ut is stopped at 7:46. all of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 9'11. the first thing i did this morning was turn on the television, almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 9'11. why? so i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else. it's almost a sense of deja vous or something. (i don't speak french). i really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though. i sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers hadn't collapsed. would everyone be okay less 500 people? i'm really ready to see us attack iraq. iraq is just a big problem. i've always carried myself with little opinion because why should i, me, say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be. i don't know much, all i know is what the news tells me. how can anyone say we shouldn't attack iraq? if we do, i am confident that it was the right thing to do. people just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do, we'd probably say the same thing. these new what if america wasn't america? commercials are really fascinating. i find them very effective. i mean, a man goes to the library, and wants to find some books, it doesn't even matter the topic, and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested. i never really thought about that. i mean, i can go to the library, pick up a book on atomic bombs, check it out, and no one asks a word. it's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned. that's pretty cool. actually, my favorite commercial related to 9'11 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are, and they say: terrorists goal is to change the way of life of america or something like that, and then it shows the next day us flags hung all over the building and says they succeeded. that is just a cool commercial. i remember when there used to be flags everywhere. now you're lucky if you ever see them. i guess that's not natural to be so patriotic. i think we saw so many flags because we needed to be reminded that we all have something in common and we need to stick together. the news is starting to get on my nerves finally. what is really weird is me, probably like many other people, were wondering what today would be like. would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison? i even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more. what happens? everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 9'11 in their thoughts, but refuses to let it take them down. it seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that. for a while after 9'11 i was pretty scared. i wondered what was going to happen. i almost didn't even want to be in the country. but then, when thinking about what i'd be giving up, i realized that even if the us is under attack, it's still the best country in the world. now they are doing the i am an american commercial. they are analyzing how the different people say it. makes me wonder how i would say it if i were to be on tv. would i say it proudly, or with anger in voice (toward the terrorists), sadly, or just normal. the different tones were amazing. i never looked that much in the to the commercial until now. wow. i bet now most people would say it proudly, but what about a week after the attacks? would you not say it with pride, yet more sorrow. there is just a huge amount of commercials on tv that deal with this situation. although commercials are effective, i feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music. music is so powerful. you know, when you're hearing that god bless the usa or america the beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits. similar to church i suppose. whenever i'm at church i get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved. that's exactly how i feel when i hear those patriotic songs. well, i suppose in many ways, god was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing. the sunday after 9'11 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches. i know i was at church. everyone just needed to hear something good. i don't really worry about that stuff anymore. i figure it's like worrying i'm going to get the red nile virus or whatever. i mean, they act like it's the terrible virus but it hasn't even killed 20 people. heat kills more people than that. let's go worry about heat now. no need to worry so much anymore, it is time to enjoy life.

"i am in my dorm lost in my own thoughts. my roommate went to houston so i am left here to do homework and what ever else i decide to do to take up time. the tv is blaring, however, i hardly ever watch it. the people next door are playing their music and i hear some bustling in the hallway. the air conditioning is making this high pitched squeaking noise. somebody just got off the elevator. my stomach is growling, i have been up for several hours and haven't eaten. i love my computer. i feel sorry for people who do not have a computer in their room. almost all of the classes ise the internet so it has to be difficult to do much work. i have a really short attention span. that is why i can't watch tv every thing i see reminds me of something else and i start to not watch the tv. i like it here(ut). i thought that i wouldn't like such a big school because my high school was so small, however, i found that i do like it. it is good to have a change. some people think that change is not good but i think even the best things need a change every now and then. i have to use the restroom. the light in our bathroom flickers every time you turn it on. it doesn't bother me i'm just glad that my roommate and i have a bathroom to ourselves. i don't know if i would have been able to deal with someone who does not keep their bathroom clean. dishes in the sink are kind of like that for me too. if there are any in the sink i always do them. i guess you could say that it's a pet peve. burger king ad is on the tv that sounds good. this computer light is giving me a headache. for the past couple of years my eyes have been giving me a headache. certain lights hurt my eyes. it is a miracle if i go a day without my head hurting. i like to drive standard cars. i really makes me angry when people buy a sports car that is automatic. it would be so much more fun if it was manual. i am the worlds worst speller. and i think i have dyslexia. i confuse my left and right especially when i'm driving. it's not that i don't know the difference i know which way to go i just say the wrong one. really i'm just a hypochondriac. my best friend came to visit me this weekend. i had a blast. now i have to go visit her. she lives in jacksonville, texas. never heard of it, well no one has it's just below tyler. basketball is now on tv. i don't know who is playing. my cell phone just rang. too bad they are just going to have to wait i'm in the middle of something. i wonder who it was. oh no my twenty minuets is up. it was nice talking to you. bye.

"right now i am feelng a bit anxious to be done with this writing assignment. i don't think i have ever written for 20 minutes straight and i don't know if i can do it. i feel full because i ate a big lunch and i am looking forward to being done with all of my homework so i can sleep good tonight. i feel relaxed and stress free and it probably has to do with the fact that i have been sitting down in front of my computer for several hours now doing my own thing. that is, anything i want to and not things that i need to get done. i feel good after doing my own thing because i don't feel commited to anyone or anything. okay, 5 minutes have passed. i can't do this. what am i going to type about? i don't know how to describe the way i feel or my sensations. this assignment is a trick isn't it. it is meant to show that there is no way to express them and you just feel them internally. oh boy, i am excited about the coming week because i just joined one of the choirs here at ut and i can't wait to practice. music makes me feel good and i love to sing. singing takes me away from all the daily stresses of this world and helps me appreciate the finer things in life. also, there is a girl i met in the music school that i might get to see when i go to choir. she is nice and i wouldn't mind talking to her and getting to know her better. i am know thinging about maryann. i don't know why but maybe because the girl at the music school has brunette hair just as maryann has. i wish i would have told maryann the way i felt about her along time ago. the choir director is really nice. she took time to audition me with on days notice and accepted me without many questions asked. i don't know anyone in choir and i hope i make friends in there pretty quick. in fact, i don't know many people here at ut yet. i feel lonely when i eay along or i don't have anything to do on weekends. it is different from back home when i could call one of my friends up and we would just hang out together. i am now thinking about my weight. i just lost a lot of weight and i want to make sure i keep it off. eating here at jester is tempting to get a lot of food because it is all you can eat. if i gain weight. i am going to feel down about myself again and that is absolutly what i don't wat. the pastor this morning was powerful and i liked evfree all together. i will probably visit grace bible next week but i anticipate i will join evfree. they have great worship there and i like the pastor. their first service will take awhile to get used to because it is so traditional, but i know i can handle it. i think that church would be a great place to grow as a christian and meet other christians. i hear chris' voice in the hall and i am thinking about him rollerblading and the cop telling him to take the rollerblades off and walk home. that's funny. okay. i have 7 minutes left. i can do this. wow. time flies when you are typing about your feelings. now i am thinking about my roommate mike. i am wondering what he thinks about me. i don't know if he is mad at me for anything or if he likes me. i hope he likes me because i want to be able to get along with the person i am living with. i hope to be a witness to him this year and maybe he will accept christ soon. that would be great and i want god to do that through me. i feel so sorry for bernie right now. she has the problem with aaron and she doesn't know what to do about it. i wish aaron would grow up and realize that he needs to back off. he's been ticking me off lately. it makes me mad when i think about him and i'm mad now. why does he act like a baby and whine to everyone? why can't he take things like a man. all he has been doing is whinning to bernie and telling her how ""he gets lonely eating by himself everyday"" and trying to make bernie feel sorry for him. ah! three more minutes! i'm excited. i didn't think i could do this but it went by really fast. i am not looking forward to doing laundry this weekend. i have never done laundry in my entire life and i really don't know how to. what if i turn my clothes different colors? what if i have to buy all new clothes because i messed up on the laundry? ooo. i'm worried about that. it is so cool that i found all these old nintendo games on the internet that i can play in my spare time. i haven't played some of those games in 10 years and they bring back good childhood memories. my email program just dinged so i have email which is very exciting. i can't wait to read it. it is now time for me to stop writing so this is it. i leave with a good feeling of anticipation.

"i am thinking about jason and wondering if we will get married. i am really happy but then there is tim, who wants to get in my calculus class and my teacher is an absolute freak. what is a freak anyway i don't know but i have heard that there are a lot of freaks here. my roommate is asking me what i am doing and i want to tell her that i am typing on my computer. can't she see that? some people are just redundant. this paper is redundant and life is redundant. people keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again, and they don't see the pattern. it took me a while to see the pattern of my redundancy but now i see the pattern and i still make the same mistakes. i always make mistakes and i do the same stuff and i didn't even make a sorority and i really don't really care. i can't type fast at all now i am stealing my roommates thoughts maybe i just am really dependent on other people and i can't even think for my self. hey sweetie? what's your name and major? i just heard my messages and they are not even my messages because i cannot think with my roommate complaining about how popular she is, i used to be popular i was so damn popular. and now i am just a number-my social security number gone is my identity and my boyfriend and my family and my roommate is trying to sleep and i am getting tired. i wonder what you would say, yeah you, if i told you that i slept through your psychology class and don't really care about what everyone has going on in their messed up heads. i am doing this because i have to, i have to do this and i have to be responsible. i can't believe that my father yelled at me today he is lying when he says he loves me. he told me that the only person he ever loved is mom and if i am rude to her once more then i will suffer. like what is he going to do? put me in a gas chamber or send me to jail worth no food? i can't believe this stuff is happening to me, at the party tonight i felt miserable. i hate jason for making me hurt so bad, i hate loving someone that is so far away. i hate the way i feel that i am missing out, but when i try to lead a normal college life i only wish i was at his house playing pool. i'm good at pool now. the holes on his pool table are smaller than average so that when i play on a real table i could really hustle somebody. hove i ever been hustled? what all can one be hustled in? i must be the victim of some huge pimp like hustle that follows me around and lets me fall on my ass when i feel good about myself, i hate you kevin hogan, i hate your lies and my lies to everyone about you, i would have made it somewhere had you never kissed me and hustled me. i wish that this computer would stop beeping, beep beep claire needs to sleep.

"hi, when i think of this type of writing i think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and i thought it was very strange. right now i am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. troy aikman is kind of cute and emmit smith is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. my boyfriend plays football for st. marks. i love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. my friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but i can't imagine not talking to him. last night at the pike bbq thing, jerry jeff walker played and that was cool, except that i had cramps and felt bad and wes had not called so i was mifted. i knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but i still wanted to hear from him, i am not sure that i am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. i fell like i am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so i don't know what to put. i am so tired right now. i went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (i told her to make me go) the pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. i had issues with that; i don't think i was as openminded as i could have been because i was tired and hungry and grumpy and i had not talked to wes this morning. my roommates phone is ringing, i like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying, we are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than i do. that's okay. i am not that big of a party girl and i think that my friends think i am a party pooper. oh well, i did not party hard in high school so why start now. i know how to have fun, but i came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend kathleen went to harvard and she has not called me or talked to me yet. i like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to i think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht wes. i am tired adn bored oh well there are some very ood commercials on the television. i know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but i am a perfectionist. that is a major character flaw i am not that bad any more, however i am editing this little paper as i go, i mean that i am just correcting my spelling, i wish that i knew how to type really fast, liek super fast. wes thinks that i am super fine like the sugar i bought to put in my tea. wow dallas is getting their butts kicked i normally would cuss a little in describing the cowboys, but i don;t knonw if that is appropriate for this assignment, i guess it does not matter one damn bit because it is not like anyone will read this. anyway, our pledge retreat was fun, okay this tyoing thing sucks. i have no idea what i am thinking. that is what i am thinking i get to go home and see wes's football game against kinkaid. i hope that they win. okay why the hell has he not called me yet. this is very frustrating i know that he is busy but i would like to hear from him yea only one more minute. kick ass. i love that phrase it is fun to say. my roommates phone keeps beebing and it is driving me crazy, well not really but that was just something to type. okay time is up bu-bye i like that way of saying bye, the red skins just scored, okay really bu-bye this time.

"i am so excited about being down at ut but now i realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at ut. i have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. luckily, i have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. this week is the only week that i am going to go out every night but i have just had so much fun. there is a guy that i met when i came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. i am looking forward to seeing him again. i absolutely love the classes that i am taking right now. it is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. the material has been interesting and i can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. i am having some roommate problems right now, though. one of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. i need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe i will take her to lunch this weekend. saturday at the game i get to sit in a box and i am so excited. the last game was fun but it was at night and i was burning up so i can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. thankfully i will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. i really like the guy i am going with. not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. he is a gentleman and really looks out for me. last night i met this really cute guy and he kissed me but i found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to tcu- what a jerk! i am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. i thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. you really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. i am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. i really do miss my mom and my house. the food at hardin house is so gross and i hate to eat it. i know that i am going to gain the freshman fifteen. this year is my sisters debutante season and when i go home i am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that i ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. but i have been working out everyday and trying to watch what i eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and i always end up grabbing a handful. but, life is short. right now i am going to finish this writing and then i am going to study some spanish and try to start reading psychology. i am really mad that i am going to miss the first exam but thankfully i will be able to make it up. i am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. i almost wish i was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when i give it up. i have enjoyed everything that i have gotten to do and see since i have been miss teen of america and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. i would like to run for president of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. i would love to be president of pi phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. i haven't gotten involved in anything at ut yet and i am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. my neck hurts today and i think it is from carrying my backpack all around. i had to take a bunch of my books back to the co-op the other day so i got to lug the around. not fun! ut is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. my sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to tcu, but i love it at ut. i just really feel at home in austin and i enjoy the diversity of all the people. it really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. coming from midland, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. i guess i will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading.

"i just started college last week. it's hard to believe i am finally here. i have been coming to austin for football games as long as i can remember, but i always go home when they are over. this time i am staying and my family is going home. it's so hard for me to think i will be spending the next four years here. it's so big and full of so many people. the first day of class i didn't know what to think. i was so overwhelmed by it all. i decided to go through rush here at ut, and that was an experience all on it's own. it was a week full of stress, and aching feet. you are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. i just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. now that it is all over and i made my bid. i was relieved a little, but not enough. the day after rush ended classes begin. i had no time to relax or get things together. i was stressing out more than i had ever before. i didn't know where my classes were, i missed my friends and family, my roommate and i have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. i really wanted to cry. it's so hard for me to think that i am not happy here because i can vividly recall not too long ago saying that i couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. i was so excited about moving to austin. i didn't think i would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. boy, was i wrong. i told everyone that i wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as i sat in my dorm room last friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday i don't think i could have packed up my stuff any quicker. i was so excited about going home. i couldn't wait to get there. even though i did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. there are so many things to do in austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. my past week of college has been fun, but scary. i am not use to being so unorganized. i need a schedule and a daily routine, so i won't feel so strung out and frazzled. so many things have been going through my head, about college and how i feel about it and i can't exactly put it all into words. when people ask me about school i don't know what to tell them. i wish i could say i love it and i am having a blast, but i would be lying. i have had fun, but i am kind of scared and homesick and i feel like i am in a maze and i can't find my way out. i don't think i am making any sense. my feelings are just all jumbled up and i can't seem to sort through them. i need direction. i am hoping every week will get better and i will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here.

"the channel is tuned to mtv; so there must not be anything better to watch at midday. however, being inside watching crap on the television is better than sitting outside in the hellish heat. when will the madness stop. i write these words in between my 2d design studio class at the art building in the morning and my psychology class at 3:30 pm. myb studio class starts at 8 am, way too early. i write from my apartment in south austin. i get back and forth between school and my apartment by way of capital metro. the bus is convienent but not so convienent. i don't too much like this computer or any computer for that matter. technology one day my ruin the human race, we'll have to see. at the moment technology seems to be our best friend, our idle, and to some our lover. that last group of people don't really exsist. materialism is the western way of life. this is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. we need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. i would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. but what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. this is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily to subsitute for personal contact. we continue to amase ourselves with new toys, but someday we might second guess our advancements.

"i don't like icebreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. i won a huge pack of icebreaker's gum from pro grad and i now feel obligated to make use of it even though i dislike it. i do that a lot. i eat foods that i don't really like just to make my mom happy. it is not really a big deal. i usually tell people what i like and what i dislike, but sometimes i don't. my grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and i don't like coconut, but i use to eat it anyway. one day i just stopped and she didn't really notice. i was like, ""man i could have stopped a long time ago, but instead i didn't. "" okay that makes no sense, but i do not always make sense. my mind jumps from thing to thing, and i digress a lot. i get off track often. love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. to me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. i cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. i can get deep and all emotional when i feel the moment calls for it, but right now i am just not really in a ""deep"" mood. i still have to read my chemistry and read my cyberreader for my cyberpunk class. why am i taking a cyberpunk class? i have no idea. i like to try and experience new things so i decided to take it. actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. i love to be happy. i hate to be sick. i love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when i am sick. the water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. i don't want to do my reading assignments. i want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. i want to go see ""the cell"" with jennifer lopez and vince vaughn. i can be such a teenager sometimes. i do some of the most immature and silly things. i can fall all over myself when i see a cute boy band, and i can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. clay walker, a country singer, has a song called ""ordinary people"". it is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. it talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. the great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. i can't imagine being photographed all the time. i don't look good in photos when i am posing, so you can only imagine how awful i would look in ones where i do not pose. i sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. you all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that i have selfconfidence issues. i can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. i like being short. i like that people view me as cute just because i am short. being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. i just like the idea of the guy being tall. my boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because i look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason i think that makes us look cuter. why do they call the prestage room the green room? the green room is often not even green. i don't understand that. i don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. except of course for in way west texas where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. i hate people who are hypocrites. i think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. i wish i was smarter. i wish i could sing. that would be a great talent just because i like to sing. two minutes to go! i can't help but look at the clock. i am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages i have to read. i am very impatient, but i am patient when i feel it is necessary. times out! the end!

" i smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you can't be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor. well i got back from a bible study got to see some people that i haven't seen in a while i suppose it made me feel at home and i actually made plans to hang out with someone i met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much. anyways i enjoyed it but at the same time i wonder about my relationship with god i suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind. is it strong enough to i pursue him enough am i a good person sometimes i don't know. so i'm listening while i do this music seems to be something that i have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, now even though some music doesn't appeal to me i believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations. so lets get real i'm an 18 guy so i do also think about girls quite a bit. today i thought of a girl in high school i missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend. even though i don't know what the hell i want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress. i don't know? but i can't deny my feeling i believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life. sometimes i feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, live life love life. so as i continue to right i remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life. i find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each other simple glances are rarely seen. what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life. so many lonely people. what do i like: the smell of rain, the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins, the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living i met an 80 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he didn't want it to end. i agree some people have forgotten that but i hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for, someone to love, something to give, man being a kid was freaking awesome and i could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing. i wish i had a glass of milk before i went to bed but hey what can you do. well there went 20 minutes i suppose i will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry garcia ""live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful.

"ever since i came to austin about three weeks ago, the way i think has been sort of different than it used to be when i lived in houston. i feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. now that i am no longer in high school i feel that i can be my own person and that no one is judging me. the only time i feel like i have to put on a fake persona is when i am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. a lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people i knew in high school. maybe i just care too much about what other people think about me. hopefully being in the ut environment will change the way i feel. in fact, as i mentioned earlier, i feel that my mind is freer. that makes me really happy. my roommate just walked into the room, and i am really glad she is my roommate. she is probably not someone i would have hung out with in high school, but since i've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what i maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. for example, she is a liberal and i am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. i've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. it feels so strange to not see them everyday like i was used to. i think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. overall, i love college life so far because i am discovering myself and learning about different values that i am glad i am becoming familiar with. i am really glad that i am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. it gives me a sense of reward when i accomplish something i have been working hard on. my favorite subject to study is calculus because it makes me feel content when i complete a homework assignment and i understood what i did. especially when i learn and apply a new concept. even if i didn't understand everything i learned, i go to prof or ta and ask them how to do it. then i understand the concept and i am satisfied with myself. i don't like english, because sometimes i never feel good about what i wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. i guess i'm just one of those people that feels complete when i conquer a task. but maybe that's how everybody is. sometimes i base my self-worth on if i did a good job on something or not. its self-destructing at times because i am a perfectionist and i tend to have expectations too high for myself.

"i ran out of the regular clothes i wear to school and all that was left in my closet were dresses. i'm also a bit upset because the guy i am interested in keeps giving me mixed signals and his emotions just run hot and cold. i feel that he may just be leading me on and it really hurts me because i really like him and i have felt this way for a while now. my friends tell me to just forget about him but easier said than done. and i'm afraid to say anything to him because i may just be making a fool of myself. but, i really hate to think about this because it just depresses me (a subject we just finished talking about today in class). i hope to learn more about it and maybe learn something about how to analyze his behavior with me. aside from that and probably the biggest thing on my mind right now is all the reading i have to do for my classes. i know tonight i will be up pretty late even though i have to be at school at 8am! i have forgotten how stressful school is. i guess lazing around all summer couldn't last forever. oh well, it doesn't matter i actually like school and some of the pressures. it makes life interesting. now, i'm wondering if my roommate will be home when i get there. she is a great person and i really like sharing an apartment with her this year. the only problem is that we goof around a lot together and don't get much done we decide to do homework in the same room. good thing we have a 2 bedroom apt. speaking of our apartment. i'm really hungry! my stomach was growling so much in class the guy next to me was looking at me funny. i just wish there were more hours in the day so i could get more things done. but, i guess everyone feels that way. as i write this i'm just glad i am at least getting one assignment out of the way. and i wish all of my assignment for all my classes were this easy. haha well, i guess i am running out of things to say so it's a good things my twenty minutes are almost up. i'm just mad that i can't check my email because there is something wrong with my disk. i swear computers hate me. now i won't know if my friend raul wrote me back. i will buy an other disk tomorrow. great another expense. i need a job.

"well i am sitting here in my dorm room wondering what i am doing here. i am eighteen years old, and well in four days will actually be nineteen. i cannot believe that i am in college. the past three weeks of classes have been very overwhelming. i did not really know what to expect, and well i still don't know. after the first two days of classes i called home crying because i did not now how exactly to study for classes even if i did not have homework or a test the following day. i am kind of getting into the swing of things. last night my ex boyfriend called which really surprised i me. he wasn't really my boyfriend but we were for sure dating. about a week and a half ago i found out that he was dating another girl at the same time that he was dating me. i was really upset when i found out but for some reason i never cried. i usually cry over the littlest things but this time i didn't. it's not that i wasn't upset but i think that i was trying to be a stronger person. anyways, back to the point, i can't believe that he called. i am really excited because on sunday i am going to meet my parents in new braunfels to go to dinner for my birthday. my mom keeps asking me what i want for my birthday, but i don't really know. my friend katie just walked into my room. i told her to leave because i don't want to lose my train of thought. that is the problem with living in the dorm. people just walk in and out of my room and it is really hard to get things done. my roommate and i usually lock our door so no one can disturb us. oh, about two and a half months ago i got a speeding ticket and i have to take defensive driving. i rented the defensive driving video from blockbuster today. the video was so boring. i really miss my sister. she is so great to me. last night i was thinking how weird, well it isn't really weird, but almost every time we get off the phone we say, ""i love you. "" it is not weird to me but i don't think that most brothers and sisters say i love you every time they get off of the phone. i don't know i guess i just think it is cool that we have such a close relationship between one another. i sometimes think what i would do if i lost her or didn't have a sister as great as her. sometime she can be really rude to me but for the most part she is such a great sister. speaking of great people, i love my parents so much. i have never really realized how much they really care about me and worry about me until i went off to college. the day that i called them crying they were so worried about me. i called them again that night and they were so relieved that i was feeling better. also, yesterday i felt really sick and my told me that she wished that she could be here to take care of me. my family is probably the greatest thing that i have in my life. what i really wish for right now is to make at least a 3. 0 this first semester. i am going to try really hard. i know i can do it i just have to keep up with my studies and work really hard. so far i think i am doing good in studying. i am really trying to balance out study time and play time. i can't believe how much my mind switches from subject to subject. this is awesome. i have just typed so much in just twenty minutes.

i'm sitting at the computer. i just got done working out. my arms and chest are sore. the pain is good though. i want to go out. i want to start playing golf again but it is too expensive golf is fun but i like to go out partying but its expensive my girlfriend is bothering me oh well i like it my friend is talking about a boat it makes it harder to write but it is ok because i'm using his computer i want to play lacrosse but it is very rough i don't understand how they play but don't hurt themselves badly ya know well anyway i feel like running oh not really it is weird how my mind says stupid things that make no sense i think i will go to the steamboat and watch those two girls play again this will be their last time to ever play like it is a monumental breakup or something but hey what if one of them becomes good maybe i will be able to say yo man i saw them play live. noway bro yea. cool they are pretty good i cant believe e i ever liked country music because it is all so fake i mean nobody writes there songs they don't do anything but sing and look pretty especially the women. if you are ugly it is nearly impossible to be a country singer. unless you are leann rimes then you can tell every one that you are 14 and that's ok because instead of the rednecks saying damn she's got a nice ass i guess they could say she's only 14 and that makes them happy. but if you think that ugly women is 14 you are sadly mistaken she's back ok well i sure miss my jim roam i liked that show but it is on the air in austin oh well austin is cool anyway even if there is no damn parking. i miss the old days of just driving around town and then thinking to myself i go there and hey what do you know there is a parking spot or even a whole lot of parking spots. yea but then i would have to live in my boring ass town where there is nothing to do at all i mean take tonight for example i'm going to watch a band play in pearland i would be sleeping but here i'm going to start drinking a couple minutes in fact i will start drinking now oh no there is a man possessed by alcohol on the computer you must stop him he could easily kill some innocent family of 4 walking along and that would be very very unfortunate. ok whatever i'm crazy no not really so i am just about done here according to the little clock in the bottom of the screen in the bottom of the screen cool i'm going to party i quit bye ,0,-1.616958 0.02061 0.823199 0.267703 0.47819 0.858259 -0.297893 0.153001 0.00033 -0.616953 0.18718 -0.590446 0.294503 0.326007 -0.443941 0.0 -0.04277 -0.060534 -1.0152 -0.795527 -1.285344 2.026614 0.509648 0.856577 3.65616 -0.058244 -1.405604 0.117274 2.236384 1.956887 0.29962 -1.430891 1.143295 -0.906028 1.233797 0.386227 0.61393 -0.298171 -0.929906 1.655114 0.470562 -0.290834 0.208522 1.090098 0.702743 0.568645 0.122089 0.49427 -0.105945 0.6847 0.323438 -0.841755 -1.165261 0.704038 0.833448 0.664964 -1.408175 0.732907 -1.286131 1.586596 1.238373 -1.199865 -0.480161 -0.745201 1.614261 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.492762 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.674882 -0.451544 4.236117 -1.87403 4.882113 3.666339 4.163809 4.267778 4.869859,281
"my roommate just had a sandwich from subway, and the smell is killing me. it's one of my favorite things to eat. he gets somewhat annoying, though. right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up. i don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight. i hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth. i always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good. everything i am saying sounds really stupid. i guess that's how the mind works though. i've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts. most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts. he (my roommate) keeps talking to his game. it's getting old. the game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive. it even gets a little scary at night some of the time. nights are so weird here. it always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough. i always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time i remember it's too late to be calling the east coast. i don't know where my relationship with her is going. we've been dating for almost four years. maybe i should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying. would that offend him though? i don't know. i don't know about a lot of things. and i just realized that i just used the word don't know. "" the internet lingo is getting out of hand. i used to be online almost all day long. he is still talking. at least i can look forward to the game this weekend. for once i won't mind the noise. it's kind of exciting. my first texas game. i am so bored. i really need to meet people. being from out-of-state definitely has its downside. everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much. it seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what i have to do or i'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room. that, my friend, was a run off sentence, but i'm much too lazy to correct it right now. stayed up too late last night because i don't have any classes today. i should really finish my homework after this, but i am way too lazy for that. there it goes. my roommate made me lose where i was going with that last thought. i'm kind of thirsty right now, i should get a bottle of water. the austin water is gross. i'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it. we've been buying water left and right. we should really get a brita filter. this game really is addicting. i just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 30 seconds. i don't think that it's a good thing to do that. this whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references. my 11th grade english (is that supposed to be capitalized) would murder me if she knew i was writing like this, but i suppose it is okay as long as i don't get into the habit of writing this way. i am really slack. i'm only taking 13 hours this semester and i still don't do any homework. at least i am doing okay on my graded assignments. oh well. this is college life and for once i'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work. the timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before. just like when i'm running; it always takes so much longer for 20 minutes to pass when i'm on one the treadmill. very dull, indeed.

"right now i am thinking about what all my friends are doing. i just finished emailing them for the first time since i figured out how to do email in the computer lab. its wierd being away from home. but i've decided i fel only as if i am away to cheerleading camp and its just a little longer that it normally is. i am loving college life so far. i feel like i've been managing my time fairly well, but i get annoying constantly when i feel somewhat disorganizee. there is a lot to remember and things that i guess we are supposed to know as freshamn that i have no clue about. i just joined a sorority and i am stating to realize how time- demanding it is. but my grades are far more important to me. i am nervous about my classes because in high school i was used to a's (except in chemistry). i am hopefully going to tranfer from engineering to business possible business honors if i do well enough so i want to do really well. i have been doing my readings, but i was never the best test taker. i am not used to the big classes, and tey make me uncomfortable thats why i would love to be in an honors program where the classes are smaller. i am the type of student who likes to have a perwsonal relationship with my teachers, and i don't feel like i can approach them in such a large setting. people who know me find this to be odd because i am nortmally quite outgoing no matter the situation. today during class, we talked about how a majority of first year students go through depression. i think i've been trying to avoid it by keeping very busy, but i guess i somewhat am. i miss my family and my best friend vera at southwest. i even miss my teachers aned my old high school. at my high school everyone knew who i was and rspected me, or looked up to me in a way. i was a cheerleader, and the top of my class. here i'm just a number. but i'm the type of person who likes challenges, so i don't think its depression. i just look at this experience as another challenge to face in order to achieve success at a higher level. my classes and teachers are all really good- which i expected since i spent a majority of orientation researching them. i just hope i have success in all my classes. i would really love to go home at christmas with a 4. 0 which i don't think is completely unreasonable. a lot of people are counting on me to do well, my parents, my family (7 younger brothers and sisters), my extended family. its almost stressful. there is so much to do hre in austin. it is fun but i will need to prioritize sun-thur. its wierd not having anyways to tell you what to do, or when to do it. but its also nice to not have the responsibility of 9 other family memebers. i always had to make sure i didnt need t6o help my parents with driving, babysitting, or house work before i got to do any of my own things. they definelty relied on me less second semester which was really cool of them. i have much more free time then last year too because i ony have to worry about myself (that sounds selfish) but i don't need to check up on 9 other peoples lives before i take care of my own business. of coure, i still make it my business to know what they are doing because our family life was gret. there are so many personalities. we are all so unique, and it was definetly a challenge learning how to cope and adapt to each one. i think my parents are stil having fun doing it- i bet theyre glad to have gotten rid of one- but at the same time they miss me - i know. i think i have the best parents ever. they love me so much!!!!

"stream of consciousness well here i am. i wonder why the professor asked us to do this? i had to do this once before. i can't remember what class it was for. i think it was for english class. i liked my english teacher. i think her name is mrs. siskovic. she was a good teacher. she sounded when she read to us. i'm glad i took that dual credit english class, now i don't have to take english in college. that is one less thing to worry about. i wonder if i turned off the oven? oh yeah, i did. i can't believe i left the refrigerator open all night. i'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. i just bought it. at least i don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. i need to buy more cereal. that new cereal is pretty good. i think those fish sticks upset my stomach. i think next time i'll buy fish fillets. i like fish and fishing. i wonder if there is any place to fish around here. i think lake wytnie is close but i'm not sure. then again it be far. i don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. i think i'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. i really miss her. i hope she goes to st. edwards next year so she will be closer and i can see her more often. i can't believe i have to go to acc next semester to take college algebra. i must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. i've already taken calculus in high school and i made an a. i can't believe i scored so low on the sat 2 math part. i wonder if there is any more kool-aid left? i think there is grape, get some when i'm done. i'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. my hand is cramping. i think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. i hope i can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. i guess i'll just ask somebody. i hate to ask people things, especially directions. i think i'm done.

"well currently i am stressed out. it is as if i have so much to do and not enough time to do it. i get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. my academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. i am so used to being involved to the point that i came to college and repeated the same cycle. my grades reflect this. i just want to get at least a 3. 6 and go to a decent medical school. my sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. all of my friends want to become members. i am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. my line sisters reiterate to me daily that i must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. at our interests meetings we turn mean. how can i hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. i don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and i want to maintain that level of friendship. they look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. my first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. my second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. they'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. i have so much on my mind that i believe my mind is going to overload and explode. must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time ",1,1.591541 -2.766796 -1.362606 -2.79936 -2.797462 0.56387 1.39525 1.455553 0.856004 -1.374283 -0.151333 -0.590446 1.270151 -0.28279 1.848585 0.0 -0.04277 -0.255485 -0.520286 0.769455 -0.341734 0.778033 0.7036 -0.174408 -0.624052 -0.143234 1.180757 0.051704 -1.735759 -1.725703 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.62961 0.003227 0.836642 -1.109326 0.334526 0.238935 -0.883121 0.499909 -1.038726 -1.977191 -0.994928 -0.295008 -0.727057 0.196264 0.241417 1.248955 0.531977 0.938339 0.303977 -1.834628 -1.4461 0.143976 -0.772919 0.002214 0.823353 -0.954251 0.495627 -1.517455 -0.036131 -0.281449 -0.480161 0.149566 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.119931 -0.418348 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.312597 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.679223 5.023978 3.716835 4.368175 4.427979 4.876619,1440
"today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? it's only the 4th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. i stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. it's awful. i've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. i wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool i guess. i got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. i'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. this oatmeal cream pie is great, i'm so hungry because i haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. i hate when i don't know everything. well i don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. i hate when i can't understand something right away, probably because i know that means i have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. i swear that when i used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. i wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now i'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when i used to eat them years ago. who knows? or actually who cares. kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means i'm going to the chem. review at 5. it'll probably be really good for me so i shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. i can't believe that i'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but i kind of feel like i'm missing out on so much in san antonio, even though i'm not. i can't wait to get some good mexican food. it's been too long. what a horrible affect working at a mexican restaurant all summer had on me. oh well. the football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! i'm so excited, my first ut football games as a student in the student section. ha-ha. and actually i think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool. i saw something on austin's news talking about ordering the games on ppv. that's crazy. i really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and i can't watch them. like the away games for example. that'd be so cool if i could get tickets to the ou game. i hear that there's nothing like it, and i'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but i guess if all else fails i can order ir ppv for 40 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on abc or something. i actually called kenny today, after my first biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. i don't know why but for some reason i really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before i went down to san antonio this past weekend. it's cool i guess. since i'm here and he's there, but i don't know. i wish that we wouldn't of met, so that i wouldn't have to deal with it. but then again i don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. i wish that i could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that i wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. i like that boy. dang i just admitted it. i don't like him actually. i just don't know. i definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy ""karla"" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. sounds like a challenge. i'm pretty hungry for like some real food, i guess i'll go down to jcl in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and i'm exceptionally tired too. i ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and i don't think it even helped me that much since i barely got a b on the homework. man, i miss high school math classes. everything was definitely explained so much better, so yeah needless to say i'm pretty freaked out about that, i'm actually freaked out about all my classes. oh well.

"i can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course i let him in anyway. what is this control he has over me? i can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. all i see are blue eyes and red hair. deep, deep blueness. there i get lost into submission. is it me? is it all just something i do to myself? where are the lines i should be drawing. why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? i wonder if he's sleeping right now? i know he's home. maybe i should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? his room is so close just right down stairs. i know he look up at me every night through his window. he's sees everybody i let in. i'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? it will be an interesting year. i wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. although, it's hard sometimes. especially with the angel downstairs. ha! no pun intended. i just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. we're so different. i'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. i think that might be part of it. i read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! he asked me when i met him if i thought we'd be dangerous together and i said, ""i'm not dangerous with anybody,"" but i'm begging to change my mind. i wish i could see inside him. usually i can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. i guess i'll just start looking harder. if i go down there right now i know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. i'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship at least romantically. then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. who casts the spells on us? who laughs at our bumbling confusion? is it all a matter of having the ideal children? are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? if so, how does my body know? do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs?

"i have never had to write like this for a class before, but i believe that i have done something similar to this on paper -- like in a journal or something. i'm not sure what i am going to write about for twenty minutes, but i guess it will not be that hard. there's a really cool song on channel 15 right now -- i heard it while i was doing my hoomework last night. it's like a live version of a song by portishead. i think i'll go out and get the cd. when i have the money -- haha. this is a really cool group. i think i can get into their music. i'm a real music lover. i think there's always a song of some sort playing in my head. i can't wait to hear a lot of the live music downtown. hopefully we (my roomates and i) will go soon. music and art are really my thing, even though right now my major is biology. i'll probably end up giving in and doing what i want to do. i just don't know how i'll make it (financially). but enough about that. lets see. gosh, lake travis is so gorgeous. i really want to go back out there this weekend. it's so relaxing. i love being up here in austin. see, i'm from corpus christi - which is also a very pretty city - but it's just so flat down there. the land and everything. all we have is mesquite trees and cactus. the beach is great, but i grew up in a more rural part of south texas about 45 minutes or so from the beach. i can't imagine moving back to south texas though, not now that i've seen hills and trees. and no humidity! my hair does great here. my parents should retire around here. might be good for thier alergies. i don't think i will live in austin forever, but as far as texas goes, i think it's the only place i might live. i want to travel though. see all the places i've never seen. maybe i'll study abroad. who knows. gosh, my parents would die. see, i'm the only child. i've already had to come home like 3 times since i moved here in august. i miss them too though. a lot. i guess maybe i'm not supposed to go off on a tangent like that. i'm just suppossed to write about what thoughts come to mind. but i guess those were what came to mind. hmmm. i'm tired. yes, i hope i'm able to get more sleep tonight than i did last night. maybe i'll get motivated and get all my work done before. oh. 2 o'clock? probably not. but i'll get to sleep in friday and this weekend. i had better get motivated today. yeah, i guess after this i will begin studying and then go out for a jog. i always feel better after i excercise. and excercise is something i really need right now. there's just not enough hours in the day, you know? i'm taking 16 hours and 3 of the five courses involve a lot of reading. the other two involve a lot of ananlytical thinking -- something i don't enjoy a whole lot. well, not at all, actually. ok, times up. twenty minutes. wow -- that went by more quickly than i thought it would. and check out my huge run-on paragraph! i hate those. oh well.

"there are some very strange things on tv. i don't watch tv all that often, but when i do it gets stranger and stranger. i love to eat. i eat constantly. sometimes i wonder what it really is driving me to eat all of the time. crunch and munch is the snack of choice for me at the moment. buttery toffee popcorn with peanuts, it is funny to think why it is so good. but it is intriguing. why do people change? i often wonder why she did it to me, what did i do to deserve it? i thought she was my friend, but i guess i was wrong. without trust, friendship means nothing. i often think of this as i look at my relationships with other people, do i really trust them? i wonder why i sit and harass myself with the torture of scrutinizing every aspect of my life. why do i? i know there is nothing wrong with me, yet i still sit here and ask myself what i could do differently. i need to accept that people do change, including myself. i believe i am addicted to instant messaging. it is a remarkable invention. to be able to ""talk"" instantaneously with my friends all over the country is just unbelievable. i can carrying on a conversation with as many people as i can handle at one time, but usually i just stick to two or three or it becomes too much to handle. i don't even know if this is making any sense, but i don't really care. the thing with instant messaging is that i have an obsession with wondering who is on or who is getting off, i have to check every time i hear the sound of the door opening and closing, even if i have no intention of actually talking to anyone. why do i play mind games all of the time? i really do. i sit here and plot ways to make him want me or make him think i am mad or happy or whatever. i seriously need to quit eating this crap. it may taste good, but i know it can't be good for me. this is ridiculous, i really do need to stop eating.

"ok so here i am sitting here writing what i am thinking. crap forgot to look at the clock. ook 4:43. kinda took me a while. analog clocks. hey what did the digital clock say to the analog clock? look ma, no hands! yea that is pretty lame but it just popped into my mind. hah i almost wrote pooped into my mind. that would been shitty. does anyone care if i write curse words? because i think in curse words all the time. dammit my eye itches. alrighty that is a little better ok i'm still just writing not really thinking about what i'm writing or at least trying not too because i keep making all kinds of spelling errors. i can type fairly fast but when i do its fairly shitty. i keep making mistakes and having to go back and erase my mistakes so it kinda takes away from my train of thought. or stream of consciousness (sp?) as u call it. i'm not really a psychologist type person. i'm only taking this class because it sounded like the least boring of the 30 or so choices i had. plus i could tell my friends why they are so stupid. or, well, that was my original plan. i don't know now, but it still seems fairly interesting. i'm not trying to kiss ass there like i sometimes do, and am fairly good at by the way, i really think its interesting, for them most part. like the lie detector test. i found out how to beat on of those things. just lie a lot, then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine. and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth, you know kinda play stupid. lie when you don't need to. tell the truth but make it sound like a lie. convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth. heh my foot itches. reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment. whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment. it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying. and it still is. hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because i'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes. so you'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha! yoo can't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind? hihn? huh? what u going to do about that? this charis too low. there we go that is better but now it won't rock. htere fixed that too ok now this is linda wierd because my legds are pusing against the bottom of the desk which sucks because' i can't lean bakc as much. and my wrists are stargting to get tired because they have nothing to lean on. i have no where for mu wrists theya re ruined! damn my desk for now havign a wrist rest. ok this chari is too high now. and mt arpmits are sweating and i have no idea why. thta happens a lot and i hate it. it makes me look like a nervous fool evcen if i am. ok chair lowered back to where it origicnlly was ok now i'm not even looking at the words i type i'm just staring at my fingers as they type the words and not relallyt thinking about what i'm typeing that sit be interesting to see wat kinda crasyt shit comes of out omy head i know what kind of mistakes i'm makeing but i'm trying tnot tot chrorect thim and now i'm tryinf nor ro ecen hink just let my ifngers flow and let them do the talkjing not me oand now my eytes are closed that is not workingbla bla bla bla bla i'm still writing now how do u like that? ur not even going to read therse are you? i just know it your just doing this for some reason that no one knows yeet but it will be so obvious after u explain it that everyone or at least me will fdeel stupid. u know kinda like that lie detector tesxzt. if u had explained it before then it wouldnt have worked. if i knew how a lie detector test worked then it wouldnt really be that hard to beat. and since u said that they're so accurate, that is making us think that they work all the time so then if we ever get convicted of a crime, or at least on trieal then we'll think that the lie detector works and we won't be able to fool it but then you told ous how it worked and so now we know that is it is not har as accurate as u originally tol us that it would be ok maybe i should just randomyl type letters and see what comes out i'm fsitting here typeing words onto my computer screen and i really doint beel like isttint here typing words i really want to be sleeping of playing counterstaiek or fucking my girldfirend. ytes that last one idont know wny trs last but that sounds really good right now, don't u think.

" the first thing that comes to mind is that when i do these things i don't know what to write. i just sit trying to think of things to write. this to me is like one of those awkward situations like when you are with someone you don't know and have to make small talk. this is like tring to think of something to say to that person the only thing is, is that your the only person here trying to think of something to say to the computer. another thought popped into my head and that is that i don't know what to do in my speech class. i have to give an interview to someone and be interviewed by someone and i have no idea on what i want to do with that. i had an idea and the professor was going down the list of names asking us what we were going to do ours on and i had an idea and the girl before me took my idea so now i am left here with no thoughts on what to do in this situation. i will just have to go on and think of something else to do on this project, athough i am not to really worried about it. i wonder if while doing this writing experiment that the reader ever takes into consideration that some people might have periods where they just don't think about basicly anything. that they are just in a daze where no clear thought comes into their mind and they have absolutely nothing to talk about. i was just wandering. now a song that i hate has just come on that i heard for the first time while i was visiting for the first time that part the family that you don't talk about because they are imberasing. i don't think i spelled that word right, but anyway it was in arkansas and i don't plan on ever going back there again. now another song i hate has come on but i am in a delimma because of this contineous writing thing i can move my fingers to change the station. i now looked up at the clock seeing that i only have three minutes left and this is not as hard as i thought it was going to be, but my essay has been pretty boring because i am tired and had nothing to talk about. the reason i am so tired is because i have an eighto o' clock clase everyday and it really, really sucks. well, i only have 2 seconds left and actually i would like to talk for a longer period of time but i guess i will talk to myself on paper where you can read at a later time, bye.

"my neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. i went to kinsolving and the lab was closed, that stunk. i'm very tired because i did not get very much sleep last night. some girls on my wing and i were going to go to some frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. it turns out one of my roommate's friends is also in this psy. class, i thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. i haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at ut, i really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. the cowboys are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!! i worked for them for about nine months, so i am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 23 years or so. i was able to get him a bluebook autographed by troy aikman for father's day this year! i really enjoyed giving that to him i love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!! i love to make people happy and some people think i'm crazy for that, but i think it's great. that's another reason i have enjoyed my intern ship with the cowboys so much. when i get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the cowboys will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. let's see 7 more minutes of writing. my roommate and i were talking about our special talents, i told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!! yes, if i walk down guadalupe, i will fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 20 people that happen to be walking by!! that is something else, hey!! i just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. this is a man who says he cannot send me $100 a month, but can take a two week vacation to south dakota and buy a new car in the same month!! anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 2 more minutes of writing, i can handle it, hey i'll bet you can tell i'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! well it sure has been great talking to you. and as our good friend tex would say: goodbye and good luck.

"my stomach is really full from the waffles and breakfast sandwich i just finished eating. i keep smelling this minty sensation everywhere that i go. right after i finish this i have to go to thursday's website or pollstar to see when they are playing a show in san antonio. i feel slightly uneasy: school is starting off to be surprisingly easier than i thought it would. i have to find a way to get more shifts at work so that i can continue to pay to go to school here. there's this band called brand new that rocks. i've been listening to their cds for the last month non-stop, they're coming around here in the next couple of months and don't know if i should go or so just save my money. then there's this girl who i can't stop thinking about. she is my ex-girlfriend and she treats me horribly, yet i can't stop myself from wanting to be with her. a couple of days ago i went and watched thirteen"" (co-written and directed by a ut grad) with my friend lydia, who i hadn't seen in nearly two months. i know that every teenager on earth thinks that their life is the hardest and most complex thing to deal with, so i'll try not to complain about mine. my life has been pretty good, i've always done well in school and stayed out of trouble. i don't really party very much, i don't smoke or drink, which i get a lot of crap for considering one of my friends is the president of the hell raisers. people come up and tell me about their problems or i read the paper or watch the news and realize just how miniscule my ""problems"" really are. i'm excited about the experimentation part of this class and hopefully i'll have time to sign up for it after i'm done with this but, we'll see. lately i've been acting really weird and doing things i wouldn't normally do. i started working out on a regular basis, which was always something that i tried to avoid with all my heart. i'm saddened by one of my favorite rap groups, bone thugs n harmony, who have hit an all-time low. they've gone from selling out the erwin center in '96 to opening for the insane clown posse and stubbs bbq. the saddening thing about that is that icp are the worst act to ever grab hold of a microphone. it's not possible to think of anything more painful than listening to one of their songs. it's people like those two idiots that make me lose faith in mankind. and the fact that there are people who actually listen to that filth religiously is seriously disheartening. i think i have to go to the bathroom, but i got to wait until i'm done with this and i've checked on thursday. then i have to make sure that i don't have any tests scheduled for the same night as a concert. i already have one conflict on oct. 30, when taking back sunday will be rocking the masses whilst i whittle away taking a math test. hopefully i can get done with the test in time to hustle over to stubbs and catch their set, it's a highly anticipated one and they shouldn't let down.

"working out is stressful. especially if all i do is arms. man i am tired. i wish i could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout. i need to go to the bathroom but i can't since i have to right this. i'm glad that i finished the reading assignment over the weekend. oh my arms are so heavy! i like working out but sometimes it takes a toll. my biceps are bulging and pulsing. man i wish i could play a game right now. and now i have gone blank a little. its tough to do this. to think about what one is thinking. i need to move my mouse. there we go. now i need an arm pad or an extension to my desk. man i wish i could rationally think sometimes. or maybe i do. i really need to extend this desk. now i'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good. wow, now i'm getting thirsty, but its probably because i just got done working out. it says it is 76 degrees outside. let me actually check. it is. a shake would taste good right about now. jester 2nd floor was good today, but not like i had expected it. a lot cheaper though. its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than dine in dollars. i've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner. i usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner. so i wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner. it probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then. who knows and honestly who cares. the room next door to us has a very squeaky door. it slams hard. ouch my deltoid. i am hungry, or maybe thirsty. i really can't decide right now. ouch! wow 11 more minutes. this has kind of gone by fast. i thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment. and i'm so glad i did my readings the weekend before. it allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment. those 30 seconds went by fast. the people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me. up till like even 2 am in the morning i can always hear people outside my window. i wonder why they are up so late outside. usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind. well i'm going to get something to drink right now. i have had the grape flavor yet so i'm going to see what that's like. never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one. going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how i was sore, or maybe just tired. now i have a coke though. but i need to fill my food void. some applesauce would be nice. but i do love sour punch straws. mmmmm. they are so good. nah ill have applesauce. there are also some grapes too. green grapes! my favorite. i don't know why but i've never liked red ones or purple. withe they call it. my favorite color was purple because i loved the grape flavor so much. now i've changed my ways because i've learned that purple is a feminine color. now to get some applesauce. i have to have 2 at a time or its not enough. i'm a klutz. i always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to. i don't know why but i've been wanting to get fatter. or at least gain wait for a long time now, but i need to eat healthy because i have high cholesterol. i always wanted to gain weight because of football, now i just say it because i always have. when buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible. they are 4oz each. it says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple. yes! 1 minute! this applesauce is a little watery. i hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it. that really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat. but it goes good with french fries!

"so, i'm sitting here staring at the computer screen. i wonder what i'm supposed to write about. thousands of ideas enter my mind, but one completely stands out. my roommate is again in a fight with her boyfriend. how can one person have so much anger trapped up inside of them? how can one person be so hurt and so hurtful to or from another. i know that i sometimes get in fights with my boyfriend. but they are nothing like this. i just don't really understand her sometimes. she complains that they don't talk enough, but when they are on the phone they have absolutely nothing to talk about. what else is new, all she does is sit around in the room waiting for him to call all of the time. i go to class, come back, and there she sits still. i just can't do that. i mean, i'm dedicated and love my boyfriend, but not to the point of putting my own happiness and life on the line for one person. i don't think that i'm selfish, i feel like i have my priorities straighter. except i happen to be the one without the degree plan that everyone else already has set up. i don't know what i want to do with the rest of my life. there are so many opportunities out there, how do you know deadon what you would like to be? my interests change daytoday. one day i want to do this, then the next day it's this other thing. the only sure thing and deadmindset thing that i'm involved with is my boyfriend. we've been together for a long time, and i've never felt as strong about anyone as i feel about him. we make all these plans for our future together that i hope come true. but they are only things that i want right now. i would love to marry this guy, i've been settled down for over a year now, and i'm happy this way. we both adjusted our lives for each other. i just wish the time was here. but i can't help to think of that continuous thought in the back of my head, of what if. i am extremely superstitious. i believe that there is a reason why we met each other, and every event that has happened since, has. but maybe i don't always get what i want because i'm supposed to meet someone else while he is not around. i have never been happier in my life, and i am always afraid of change. this move down here to college shuck me up enough. now things are finally getting settled and i'm meeting tons of people, but i don't know whether or not i should dedicate my time to what i am giving it to. i make time for everyone, but not always for everyone. i keep a lot of time to myself. i hate having to turn people down, but it seems as if i am always doing that. tomorrow my friend invited me over for dinner, and that should be a lot of fun. we have kind of lost touch, and it should be good for us to get back into the swing of things. well, i think that has been twenty minutes. i hope you enjoyed my ""interesting"" train of thought.

"it is not as though they dit down and say ""hey, i'm going to change who i am today, just for the fun of it!"" and if they do they aren't serious about changing. i have changed. a lot. it almost scares me how i have evolved as a person over the past several months. my thoughts have changed, how i view myself and other people, how i respond to certain situations, my opinions, beliefs, morals, attitudes; they have all been dramatically altered since this time last year. the funny thing about this is the reason why. i always considered myself to be a person set in my ways, never to step out of bounds, never to go against what i thought was socially acceptable. on a small scale, i was my own person, unique in every way, but in the scheme of life, i was right there with every other middle class high school girl. trying to fit in, to wear the coolest clothes, listen to top 40 music, go to all the parties to make and appearance and be friends with certain people just because they were ""popular"". then i met cody, and i realized that there was so much more to life that what i was used to. the world wasn't one big happy carousel, spinning and singing and whoever got the prettiest horse was best. no, that's not how it was. there were problems in the world, and i realized that i had been ignorant to them, and it wasn't right. i came to realize that there is so much hatred and apathy out there, and it's tolerated. not accepted, but tolerated, and that's wrong to. cody taught me that it's okay to stand up for what i believe in, even if everyone else wasn't doing it, to do it for myself. not to condone the racism, sexism, homophobia and bigotry that goes on behind closed doors. if we ignore it, it will only fester and grown until there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. i began to realize then that it doesn't matter if you're wearing polo jeans, or if your parents just bought you a brand new mercedes, because in the scheme of things, it's all irrelevant and pointless. this message was made clear to me through cody and the music we listen to. it's okay to be different, it's okay to spike your hair and pierce your eyebrow, because the people who frown upon you for doing so are the people who are afraid of change, the same people that tolerate that same hatred i previously mentioned. it's okay for me to be different as long i know that i'm doing what's rights, and the two should never be confused. you can be considered a social outcast and still contribute more to the well being of society than some big shot in his three piece armani suit, (the epitome of luxury that most people in america idolize today) sitting behind his desk letting his greed for power and money boil into hatred to the point that he will step over all those ""lower"" than him to get what he want's. this isn't right. yet this is the american dream. what is wrong with this picture?

" ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people i never want to talk to again. the shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. i hope i don't misspell too many things. i am sniffingly so loud. i should go get a tissue. i never did learn how to type right on this thing. why did my thoughts just totally flip? wow, that's weird. brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. i really wish i could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when i'm emotional. it really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until i can see straight. but i won't be crying any more hopefully as i am cutting off those jerks from high school. i don't need than, nor do i wan them in any aspect of my life. they just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. wow, london tell them how you really feel! i hate computers when i have fake nails. i always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. my back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. i think it's time to switch positions. ah. much better. now my typing skills really stink. it's really hard to lay on the ground and type. oh i have a laptop. that would be stupid to do if i had a regular pc. i still can't get comfortable. the floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. that's better. i don't know why i didn't get on the bed in the first place. ahhh!! yes, i do i don't want to be on my white comforter!! oh no!! you know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. you would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. stupid back gives me problems all the time. i miss dr. jones!! i don't know how i'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever i hurt. it just occurred to me that i might be using aim abbreviations in this writing thing. that might not make me look too smart. oh, well. i don't want to go back and look at it. it would just take to long. god, my nose is still stopped up. my skin is drying out to. i need to wash my face and moisturize. i forgot how to spell moisturize!!! i had to retypr it like three times. you know for someone who is supposed to be smart, i am pretty dumb sometimes. i wonder if pennebaker thought i was dumb in class today. i zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. i wish i could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe i could pay attention in class. but no. i have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. i seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. i was going to use a bad word, but i don't know if that would be appropriate. i wonder if it would affect my grade if i did write a cuss word. is that how you spell cuss? maybe i should have just wrote curse. and why do i always have to fix the word just? every time i type just without paying close attention i put an extra j in between the u and the s. it makes me feel quite stupid. time just ran out. i'm glad because i want to just go to sleep and forget about people i will never have to see again.

"i just completed the pretesting survey. sigh, things like that make absolutely no sense to me. i can never decide exactly where i stand, and i can never define myself with the choices provided. always have to compromise who i am. i always end up generalizing all of those qualities i have fought tooth and nail to keep. starting college has been such a weird experience. a room full of people, but i am still alone, a street full of people, but i am on my own, a world full of people, i have nobody but myself. i am glad the ball has started to roll. college is beginning, and, so far, there have been no horrid surprises, i have not been ambushed by a detail i have overlooked. i now have to gauge the speed of that ball, and plan my life around it. i need to visit my family this weekend. that is a drag, i am just beginning to form this new life, just starting to assemble my new identity, and i have to disassemble everything, and hide it in the closet. family, sigh, the wonderful thing about family is you are sentenced to being around people who you probably will never get along with. parents are even funnier. you are sentenced to respect and obey these people you probably will never get along with. i bet you are assuming i don't get along with my family, that we fight all the time. right and wrong. i don't get along with my family, the key word is i. the person they think i am gets along with them perfectly. we haven't fought in 2 years, that was the last time i tried to be myself around them. then i realized that i had to either bullshit them and survive, or go down in history. so here i am, mr. bullshit. sigh. sometimes i wonder where the bullshit ends and i begin. i stopped wondering about that a while ago. it was too hard to tell. i hate every person who is in my life right now. my roommates are ok, but immature. my girlfriend, that's right, girlfriends, are not compatible with me, but i am not willing to give up having sex, to be perfectly honest with them. at least not until i can find somebody i get along with, and can have sex with. i don't know why i place so much importance in sex, but that is all i can think of when i see a slightly attractive woman. i feel so evil sometimes, but i am sure my parents would be proud. i might be a depraved heathen, but at least they taught me how to bury myself under selfguilt. good for them. this is the end of the twenty minutes; i need to go get my laundry out of the dryer now. until next time. ciao.

" ok. i don't know waht to type right now. im listening to alanis morissette right now and the song is about whether she is good enough for anything. sometimes i feel kind of like this; like im not good enough to do anything. now im stumped again as to waht to write. i talked to my best friend kelly yesterday and she is back home now. she went to taiwan for the summer to do an internship. then she went to california to ride a bus back to round rock. but she kept missing the bus back so she ended up staying in california. im really excited that she came back. i havent seen her in like four months and i didnt get to see her off when she left. i was really sad. sometimes i miss having a best friend here. kelly is my best friend in all but she has her schedule and family problems and a lot of times i just miss having a best friend to do everythign with. haley, one of my other friends used to do a lot with me. . almost everything. but this summer she got a job and her dad got a raise so now that she has more money, it seems like she is too good for me. i don't like people like that. there is someone at our room door. haley and i were suppost to go to breakfast one morning and had planned it all out. but then the morning of the event, she had one of her other friends, jennifer, call me and tell me haley couldnt make it because of a doctors appoinment. i was like, why can't haley call me herself. then she tries to play it all off. i don't really have anything to say to her now. i havent seen her on campus since classes started and weve only talked online about two or three times. thats not much compared to how much we used to talk. twenty minutes is a long time to continuously type. i guess its not too bad for people who type slow but for those who type kind of fast, this just makes for a lot of nonsense talking' typing. ok. this semester im taking karate' tae kwon doe. its really fun but a lot of work. i signed up for the class because i thought it wouldnt require too much work - aside from the work out - but actually this class has books and i have a three to five page paper due in it. its the only class i have a paper due in this semester. how odd is that?. oh well, it should be fun either way. this alanis morissette music is some really angry music.

"k. , now i'm writing, but i'm actually kind of confused about what to do. i never really had an assignment such as this one. i feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so i guess i feel some what good right now. i feel excited about school because i finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. i guess my hopes are kind of high right now. i was also excited about your class since i nearly did not get in. at first, the class was closed and so i gave up until i peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after i added your class. i also feel kind of stressed because i'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. on top of all of this i am now taking more hours this semester than i have ever had, so i guess i have my work cut out for me this year. i am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, i feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if i have now surpass the 20 minute mark or not. nope, still got quite a bite of time left. so, lets see what else i feel. i also feel somewhat lonely because i had to leave my family and friends at home. even though i have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. my goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 4. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. i like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. i found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. so, i hope that's ok. part of the confusion i feel is because of this class. i went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now i had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if i'm allowed by the computer. ah, my time is almost up and i'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone.

"i've done alot of self-analysis lately. i realize a few things about myself. i'm a bit obsessive and i believe that may hinder the growth of my current relationship the person i started dating is a wonderful guy, but i take all the small things to heart his dealing with a alot of coming out issues and that makes it much harder on him. the nature of the relationship itself is freaky even for me here is this guy. i've been best friends with him for three years now. he and i have been roommates for about two years and it's like all of a sudden the doors of our relationship have flown open. he is now doing things that before i didn't imagine with him. he was a friend now he's something. do i want this? yes, i guess. i have talk to numerous people about this, like renee. she is a wonderful friend. her whole entire existence revolves around one thing right now. sex! it seems to be a common search for people our age. what if you settle for less, because emotionally that person is so well suited to you. is that bad or good. i view that as okay. i need reach within myself and learn whether or not. settling for less is good or bad. i do know one thing. i do great work, when motivated. i become more goal orientated lately. setting one tasks and completing it well. it is time consuming but i believe it will be more beneficial to those i serve. i've been struggling to pick a major and right now i don't know. i'm so lost i really just need some direction. this school year has just been really confusing. my whole life has changed in a matter of one month, but i'm happier. happiness is really a weird word. i think sometimes it just adding a little bit of energy to a doomed project. who knows time to reconsider my thought and self image. life would be easier, if there wasn't some guy up there scrambling our thoughts. i don't believe in a higher being, but maybe there is a higher bean. hehehehe!!!! i used to believe in god then during some ""clarity"" i thought who would do right by making animals who feed off of each other. either emotionally, physically or mentally, finding those symbiotic relationships i guess is one of life's little hills we must all conquer. i love life!

"i have been asked to do this psychology assignment of writing down my train of thoughts and feelings for twenty minutes with out stopping. so far that was my first train of thought i know it's a boring intro sentence, but yet i'm not allowed to stop and think of how to write more eloquently. i guess that leads me to my next thought school. this is my first semester at college and there is so much going on. when you asked to write down our stress factor on a scale of 17, i believe i might have marked an 8. there are so many things that are going on, and i want to be able to organize everything in time slots. the only thing is that they keep giving me stuff to do. i suppose you would define ""they"" as professors with homework and s. i meetings, which i really want to attend. then i had my first sorority meeting last night, and they have so much in store for us this semester. i suppose i should tell you that i love going home not to see my family (will, sort of that too you got to love mom and dad!), but i have boyfriend back at houston. i was planning on going home all these weekends, but it turns out that i have something i have to do that is mandatory on almost every weekend. this boyfriend of mine is totally worth the trouble and stress of going home. i have had the most amazing summer with him just hanging out and doing fun activities. he makes me feel ten times happier when i'm around him and it's just really hard not having him here to help me adjust into this new life style. i do however, talk to him everyday and write him letters. the first week i arrived in austin, i can honestly say that it sucked because rush drained a lot out of me and then we had to start school with no breaks from rush week. i thought i would be able to adjust better in this big place, because i consider myself an easy going friendly person. there is just so much that is consuming my life right now that i hardly have time to stop and think about what i need to do. i love exercising and used to do it everyday, and now i haven't had time to do any of that this past week because of school. i just hate this time in my life right now when everything is so jumbled up in my brain. i can't wait for the day when i have everything organized and i don't feel too constrained to one aspect of my life. i also hate this time because you don't really know anybody. true, i've met people and they are all really nice, but i haven't gotten to that stage when you can say anything to them and not look stupid. i am really glad that i did join the sorority just so i can meet people, but there are 60 people that i can meet and that's just too much for me to build strong friendships all at once. i do have some friends from back home, but i hardly have time to visit with them because i'm so consumed with everything else. i just need to sit down and relax. i did go home for labor day to visit my boyfriend, and that was exactly what i needed just to hang out with someone who knows you so well. we did basically nothing and it was great not having to worry about anything. that weekend i think was somewhat a turning point in my attitude of college. it just made me realize that it is harder than i thought (adjusting wise) but everything turns out okay in the end. plus i was happy to know that i do have somebody who loves me just as much as i love him; and that when i'm missing him, he's thinking about me too. i guess it just made me feel not so lost in college knowing that i have a great person back home supporting me every step of the way. okay, twenty minutes are up.

" i wish travis would stop switching channels on the tv. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at ut. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. so in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. for a 19 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature? i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like kendra im gay and i'll be like i know its about time and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of pbs. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his alone time with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video ",0,-0.600765 -0.226722 0.288198 0.0038 -0.012233 1.619162 -0.737244 -0.750137 -0.389211 0.189604 -0.155623 -0.303522 -0.299211 0.027207 -0.453259 0.0 -0.04277 0.819875 -1.285228 -0.795527 -1.570244 -0.525469 4.198267 -0.889702 0.381778 -0.386211 0.558637 -0.662075 -1.568163 -0.909687 -0.442314 -0.788316 -1.275466 -0.906028 -0.753383 -0.40643 -0.310686 -0.796767 -0.140781 0.298415 0.025301 0.385608 0.911598 0.34048 1.877563 -0.30229 -0.522178 1.9661 -0.610887 2.806531 0.30169 0.524043 0.188231 -1.071247 0.681365 0.586608 1.66016 -0.359539 0.251015 -0.433484 0.708121 -1.035766 -0.480161 -0.362261 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.058372 -1.297083 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.349664 -0.37208 0.064257 -0.422267 0.490649 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.652694 5.174144 3.198047 5.023906 4.914641 4.824162,1665
"today has been the worst and most stressful day ever. all i want is for something to go right! i tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again i've messed something up! i was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that i thought was gone but realized after i had erased half o of it that it was really still there! aahhh! can something please go right? my ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. i don't even know if i'm supposed to push enter when i get near the end of the line but i figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. i just looked at the clock and i've only been writing for four minutes. why does time go by so slowly when it counts. speaking of timing, mine is the worst! i always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. whenever i like a guy i'm to shy, stupid, scared, immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me i have lost interest! or they never have interest in the first place and i find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead of the one who likes me! or in one case i'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when i like him. ahhh! actually i had my chance and now i'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship! ten minutes to go and i'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! i want someone who respects the fact that i'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . which reminds me as i look above my roommate's computer of another guy who i let slip through the cracks even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, i never acted on my feelings, wait a minute i did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. i wish i could play truth or dare with the other guy i like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, i liked you then and i liked you up until i found out there was no chance for us and i resented you a little! someday i'll get up the courage to tell him! it is about twenty degrees fahrenheit in my lovely room in jester east on the tenth floor. the air conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as i type. i have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface, i almost passed out at the draw for the football game against rutgers this saturday, i refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes i will. one minute to go and i'm starting to feel relieved that i wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon i'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. i'm majoring in psychology but i used to want to be an architect. oops, i got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two.

"throughout my life i have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future. for example, when first arriving at ut i was awe-inspired by the size of the campus, and the enormous amounts of students which attended. i was shocked by the different races which represented each other. i could tell that everyone was already forming their own little ""clicks"", whether it was based on their interests in music, race, sex, sexual orientation, everyone was already making new friends, and social gathering were taking place. while everyone was socializing i was busy worrying about the classes that i was taking, the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that i had. i was lonely, i was scared, and being from a large city, i was trying to adapt to an even larger one. although ut is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things, for example, the opposite sex,new friends, and just having a good time, while at the same time, studying. i knew coming to ut that i would have a good education, but i needed a way to find myself, who i was, and what i wanted to study, i came to ut wanting to be a doctor, but i figured that it may not be something i wanted to do. perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy, at some time in my college education, but whatever it is that i may become i want it to be something that i am going to be happy doing. i realized that high school is much different that college. college is much more demanding, and time consuming. but in the end it will even out someday. when i was a child i had dreams of being a great military leader. a policeman. a astronaut. or a physicist. as of now i don't know what i want to become i'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly. as a child i always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why i wanted to become a doctor. but now that i'm in psychology i've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind. but how it works and functions. in science i have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others. for example in psychology, it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression. or just find a way to make everyone happy, in the event that i would someday accomplish something like this, i would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle. knowing that i have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day. now that i am more relaxed here at ut it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster. finding the shortcuts. and finding which classes are the best. all the time when i first discovered what comes along with a great education. i have also figured out that i can become whatever i want to be. just as long as i put my mind to it. and test out my skills as a academian. coming to ut i knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me. i knew that with hard work and determination. i could accomplish whatever i wanted to. conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine. overpowering myself, knowing that i can't always tell myself what to do all the time. and just let my unconscious mind take over. often times when i become depressed i find that it is easier to listen to soothing music. talking with a friend. or playing chess with a friend. or playing cards with them. at times i just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily. when i do find myself depressed i always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind. and think about other things. such as playing basketball. playing baseball. or like i said playing a good game of chess with my friends. i havent quite yet found my niche at ut but it will come someday. and i too will find my interests in academics. and find something that i truly love doing. whether it be my major now. such as biology or even psychology. as a kid i remember pouring through my fathers materials. because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments. and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature. all along i thought i always knew what i wanted to do when i got older but i guess its an answer i will learn in time. ???

"i guess it is about time i start my work for psychology. although, i am quite bothered that my keybourd is vibrating from all of the bass coming from the neighbor's stereo. i don't know if you know this but you can hear here people talking loudly in the hallways at all hours of the night. all in all college is better than i thought in terms of classes and proffesor, except for calculus. but it is different in terms of people. i just don't fit in with large groups of people well. i'm one to do things in small groups or one on one. i am i guess you could say shy, not so much shy as quiet. i can talk to people i just don't talk a lot. even my girlfriend whom i've known for a year now. she talks all of the time so it works out. i miss her a lot, more than my family. at my age i was ready to move out from home, but i still haven't adapted to living here yet. i need to start getting more sleep, ithink i average 5-6 hours of sleep a night. usually i'm fine except for when i am in classes, just chemistry and calculus. i want to call to talk to my girlfriend i wqent home to houston and saw her last weekend i have not spoken to her since monday, and i really want to. i have clculus i need to be working on on top of this but it isnot do until wednesday so this assignmnet is more pressing. sometimes i woory about whether or not i am going to be able to hackk it in some of my classes once we have some tests, chemistry and calculus are pretty hard. i probably chose about the hardest major thjough, electrical engineering. i keep on think ing of songs in my head but that can't well be written caan it. i enjoy music, both listening and making music. playing guitar is one of the major strees relievers for me i do it at least 30 minutes a day now that i am in college i used to only play that much a week. i've been writing more songs now too. i hadn't written any for a while so i hasd a clear fresh mind to work off of. i have been devoting most of my free time to that i guess. i can smell the perfume on a stuffed animal in the room that my girlfriend gave me, she spraid her perfume on it last time i saw her. few people are really love at this age, i think. i know i am i'm eighteen years old and i've already met someone who's d i'd love to spend the rest of my life with. she is the first girlfriend i ever had. i'm quite picky when it comes to those sorts of things. i'm suppossed to be meeting new people and building new friendships here at college, supposedly the best times of our lives, i hope that that is wrong. i'm just not socially fit for the college way. everyone on each floor knows everyone around me, but i don't. and i don't want to i just know that i wouldn't like most of these people, i am also picky about friendships. i don't like just hanging out with people for lack of a better thing to do. i just want to have a feew really good friend, instead of knowing everybodies name and that being it.

"trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. when you ask someone ""what do you want to eat?"" most likely they will say, ""i don't know what do you want?"" well, if i did know what i wanted to eat, i wouldn't have asked you. it is a simple question with a simple answer. right now i just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, ""i don't know whatever you want"". well, that's why i asked you, i don't know what i want to eat, that's why i asked you. i guess that i wanted him to make the decision for me. i honestly don't know what i want to eat. it's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but i'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. does this mean that i'm lazy because i want someone else to make a decision that i can only make for myself. maybe i'm not lazy; maybe it's just i want someone to help me make that decision. that seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves.

"college is so cool. i really can't remember the last time i felt so many emotions at the same time. i've already met so many incredible and different people i can't even begin to describe all of them. i am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people i have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. my boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. i hate jealous people i wish everyone would just, i don't know go along with it. i ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that i have already met from camptexas. that was like almost the most fun i've had in a really long time i'm so glad i decided to go and wasn't to scared. i was so scared about coming to ut because it is so big and i just didn't know if i could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. i'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. high school was such an almost horrible experience, i hope college is so much better. so i'm in this room with these two guys, one who i met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but i have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. he is just the hottest guy i have ever seen. so i met this really cool guy from tarytown in new york which is like the place i've been obssessed with since forever. he is a guy i would really like to hang out with. this other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with britany spears i really can't stand her but i think it is just because i am so jealous that he likes her more than me. and drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and i was just thinking about jealous people. the music is blasting in my ear i don't know who it is. drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. i really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates i need a really good girl friend to hang out with. or maybe i'm just ment to have guy friends. i guess it would be okay with me i get along with them better. i think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. which is really a relief because i though it would be really hard. i've seen so many interesting people. i miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. i would never trade this experience for going to utep that would really suck. i really miss my friend bianca and anne. i think for labor day we are going to san antonio if anne and lianna and vero come up. i was thinking about noodles the other day i wonder how she is. this is got to be one of the funnest assigments i have ever done. i really think i might double major whith something in psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks i guess i could really write forever i need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for biology and probably go to sleep i'm really tired.

"well i'm supposed to write and i don't really know what to say. i'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch tv. i wasn't doing anything productive so i thought i'd get this writing assignment out of the way. do typos matter? because i keep erasing, but i don't think it really matters. ok i left one in. so it's really hot in here. and my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. but oh well. i'm waiting for the cartoon home movies, to come on. i don't usually watch cartoons, but i saw this one once and it's really funny and i liked it a lot. wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. i think i'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. i'm so sick of studying. my roommate is talking about a little girl in a missy elliot video. what song is this? i have no idea. i'm hungry, but i can't eat and type at the same time. my side itches. hold on a second. aw there we go. much better. so i don't understand why i have so much work to do in my english class. it's ridiculous! it's making me so frustrated. my other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! i have to read 22 chapters in jane eyre by tuesday. oh i like this song. probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because i'm trying to type, but it's ok. i seem to be doing ok with it on so far. i'm really tired and i wish i could just go to sleep but i need to study some more before i do. i have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. wow, i complain a lot. i don't mean to, but i do. ok. running out of things to say. talk about smells. can't smell much. it's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. damn! only 8 minutes have passed! twenty minutes feels like forever. we did a stream of consciousness paper in creative writing in high school and i remember how much my hand hurt while i was doing it. i need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. and from driving from college station (no i wasn't at a&m) to san antonio and then to austin today. that could do it to you! well i want a pretzel. they're sitting right next to me but i can't get them. when is this thing going to over with? i wonder what you learn from this? how weird and random people are? i think i'm a pretty random person. i used to say that word a lot in middle school. i hated middle school so much. i don't know why. it was just horrible for the most part. and high school wasn't much better. i like college a lot more than both already. well my show should be coming on soon. i can't wait to watch it. i hope it's a funny episode! i always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's not funny and think i'm stupid. not that i care, but i want people to know that it's a really funny show. i need to be studying for english. no, not english, music. english just popped into my head. hmm. ok only 6 more minutes. i think i can handle this. wow, it got quiet in here. and really really hot too! at first our a'c was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. and now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. katie just discovered longhorn delivery. i love that thing! i used to use it all the time when i used to come visit friends in austin. we were all pretty lazy. i'm becoming less lazy here i think. i have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. i want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. i'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since i left. my parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. i think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. i hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. i've been warned it's almost 11:30 and home movies will be on shortly! i'm excited. i think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! well my time is almost up and i'm glad. oops, i hit the caps lock for a little bit. ok 10 seconds. and i'm done!

"ok i have been a little nervous about this assignment, not too nervous but a little. i'm kind of a quiet person so writing my thoughts for twenty minutes is a little intimidating. i don't really like how a lot of the stuff we do in psychology is over the internet. i guess it's convenient, but the internet messes up a lot. it is working today though. i just bought tickets for jimmy eat world over the internet. they are one of my favorite bands. my best friend, kristina, is coming up here to go to the concert with me. i miss her a lot! i need to clean my room. courtney, my roommate, has cleaned up a little. i don't think she cares too much that i am messy. she's messy too. she is from my hometown, so i knew her before we lived together here. we are getting really close. i'm glad we decided to live together. i'm glad i didn't wait til the last minute to do this assignment. i need to do my calculus and physics homework too. i also need to, well i don't need to but i want to go get a dvd called waking life. it is really good. it is a movie that makes me think because it questions reality. i like movies like that. i've been thinking about doing stuff with movies as a career, like visual arts type stuff, but that's only if i don't get into the architecture department. i need to take this psychology course because i will need to know how colors affect people's emotions if i am going to major in interior design. that really intrests me. i need to call kristina and tell her that i got the jimmy eat world tickets. she was at my friend jory's house the last time i talked to her. i miss jory a lot too. i haven't seen her in a long time. me and kristina and jory have been friends for a long time, since seventh grade. i miss them a lot. i need to call my friend cherry too. she lives in oklahoma because that's where she is going to college. i have about four minutes left. i hope this is the kind of stuff you wanted us to write. i guess it is because this is what i'm thinking about. i hope it doesn't matter that i didn't capitalize the word i. i never do even when i write unless it is in a paper i need to turn in for english class. my senior english teacher is a really nice lady. i really admire her. she is very encouraging. i miss her too. bye ",1,1.779317 0.731947 0.558006 0.946552 1.397392 0.951584 -0.71768 -0.619892 0.189354 -0.768419 -0.210883 -0.590446 -0.263787 -0.193058 0.130942 0.0 -0.04277 0.947351 0.664114 0.92295 0.949234 -0.408463 0.821107 -1.108615 0.150158 1.158805 -0.431783 -0.306913 0.363325 0.255326 1.431838 0.547529 0.040387 0.292095 -0.610659 1.054814 -0.139596 0.946505 -0.57986 0.919785 -0.21972 -1.713969 -1.359948 -0.321255 -0.503881 0.366818 -1.093488 0.430958 0.349627 0.671386 -0.259253 -1.396551 -0.195307 0.90934 -1.394915 -1.053601 -0.182086 -0.954251 0.678313 -1.106436 -0.372037 -0.73132 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.675191 -0.221637 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.102244 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.761296 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.322718 4.85848 3.914686 4.762404 4.899728 4.894946,1578
"i want money. i like money. what is the easiest way to get it? winning the lottery is too hard. maybe i can get a wish to come true. a wish. where do wishes come from? i hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards? where would one find a leprechaun? if i found one, how could i catch it? it must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. they must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- i wonder if they drink. a drunk leprechaun. funny, the life of the party. granting wishes for everyone. what wish do i want? what else? money, happiness power? power is good. maybe i could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. i could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe i don't. i just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. two kids. maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it live off interest. that sounds good. i could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. i like sleeping. but the time goes faster when i sleep. do i want to go faster? no? yes? maybe? definitely maybe. i don't want to miss anything, but i want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. i'm too lazy to have to work for a living. i don't know how i'm going to get through it. all of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. but i only just started. preparing for my future. the future is a fantastic place. it can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if i know what i'm talking about. people die. kill eachother. why? to what end? everyone dies. what difference does it make when? i would prefer to die later in my life, though. i guess i want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. in the next millenium. nostradamus says the world will end. soon. i want to see if it happens. that would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. not as it is known, but in some form. a science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. as long as its well after i'm dead, i don't care who has it. the world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. media tells us its not coming, they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us there's no cliff, that were running towards an open pasture full of wildflowers and pretty white bunnies. but i know the cliff is there. thats something else i want to se before i die, or as i die. will the world survive? will man kill the earth first, or will man kill man first? one way, nothing survives. the other way, the earth survives, and possibly a few men, to carry on the race. i know who i'm rooting for. i want man to get to that cliff and go right off. unless it can slow down, or run a different direction, but for now, the cliff. but that should be after i'm gone. i don't have to worry about anything. if only i could catch that damn leprechaun.

"it is really really very very cold in my room. i do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. i am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. i am glad i brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one of those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww i just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. i wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all i have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn't all that fun. i need to borrow duct tape so i can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is cold. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe i should figure out the whole bus system so i can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and i do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs i would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time i am done this i will go work out for awhile. but then i will have to take another shower. don't know if it is worth that. because then i will also have to dry my hair and i hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and i am sticking to it because i hate putting makeup on. it's a pain. a waste of time, if you will. the cd stopped. i should put another one on. now i'm going to have 'yo's a ho' stuck in my head. it's not a bad song just not a song i would like to have stuck in my head. i always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it's weird. i don't know where they come from. last night i had a dream that i was yelling at erin. in someone's driveway- until she walked out on the street. i am unsure of what we were yelling about but i don't think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. i have an itch on my leg. it's itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn't a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. i wish i were staying in blanton i would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever i felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. i guess i could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. i can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first i thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. i guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 1984. i don't like it. i mean, these people are all almost 18 years old. and they are church of christ - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, i think that is their problem. not the dorms'. i definitely could not live like that. i don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if i only wanted to take classes i would stay at home and live with my parents. but i wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so i guess that is what i have to do. it's a shame i am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 550 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so i wonder how many they will have when he graduates. brrrr my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. i need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don't ever talk to them it's really a shame. i need to clean the water filter pitcher so i can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 3 glasses of coffee a day. i don't drink any caffeine. i did one day and i was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. i don't understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up? on tv people always say lets go get coffee"" or ""we need some coffee"" and it's always after some traumatic event or really late at night. i think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. i guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? i wonder why andy called this morning. i called him back twice and he didn't answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of ""i am a. d. d. "" doesn't really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. i would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. i wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 2'3 of a "". "" well i am going to end this the way i started it. it is really really very very cold in here.

"i'm currently thinking about what i just finished writing to dr. pennebaker about, my broken relationship. it was so beautiful, and the worst part is that the feeling, that beautiful feeling is still inside me. i feel it everyday: in class, before i go to bed, when i wake up. i remember the feeling of being with him, and i miss it. i miss him so much. i hate having taken him for granted. i hate the fact that things could have worked out, had i simply admitted to myself that i had fallen for a guy. that's all i needed to do. all i could do was ignore him, laugh at him, all this while trully knowing there was something else. i did all of this knowing that i meant none of it. i was fighting it! i was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth, all guys are the same. they're all jerks. be careful who you fall in love with. don't fall in love in high school, it's too soon. you have your whole life ahead of you. "" i knew they were only trying to protect me, i knew they were saying this because they themselves having been guys, knew what it is guys were after. but no, not hugo! he was different. he wasn't horny or all over me, or asking me weird sex stuff. not once did he do this. not once did he push me into something i didn't want to do. not once! we dated for a year, and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other's foreheads and cheeks. this was it. and god did he do stuff for me. i hated saying i needed something or felt a certain way in front of him, because he had always go out of his way to help-always! for valentine's day, he designed a shirt that said, ""monica, will you be my valentine?"" i remember that morning, walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something, knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me. i hugged him, nodded, and smiled. that was all he needed. i don't know what i wouldn't do to have those feelings all over again-with him!?! i dream about laying beside him, while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders. and just watching him breathe, watching his chest rise and lower, as he breathes. wow! such an amazing sight. now, all i have are our memories, most of them of me being a 'bitch' to him, treating him so unfairly. maybe he does deserve better than me, maybe this is all part of god's plan. but you see, i know god knows me and he knows i have a big heart, but am just afraid to show it. he knows this. he knows how sometimes, it's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection, or something or other. but what now? should i wait? i guess so. deep down, i have this feeling that it is not over between hugo and i by a long shot. i know it's not over by a lot. i remember how hugo treated his parents, better than i've ever seen anyone treat their parents, with such respect and love. i've always had this thing that a guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother. his dad also, that man is really such a good person. he really does have a lot to offer to his family, and i know hugo too is this type of person. i only hope he knows this about himself. i only hope he knows everything he is worth. i only hope that he knows how i truly feel about him, how i've truly felt about him this entire past year. i hope he knows that behind every crude and hateful action or word, there was an enormous amount of love just trying to get through. there was an enormous amount of love just trying to beat all the hate, and although it might have been a little late, it has been released. it has gone through all the hate. it lives in me today, right now, right this instant as i am typing, and will live in me for a very long time, if not-eternally.

"during the weekend, i love to go to mall. to buy something that makes me feels good. if i have a chance to go in the mall, first, i would like to eat something in the restaurant because i get starve. i love to eat chinese food. sometimes i choose sweet sour chicken and fried rice. that is my favorite food. if i have a second choice that it would be pepper steak and white rice. when i am full, i start thinking of what i need t shop around other place to buy what i need. at this time , i need to buy fall season cloths. all i have right now is one pair of jean and one sweater. that is not enough to wear for the rest of the season. all i need is one more extra sweater and another pair of jean. and then i would like to buy something to decorate my house. i would like to have of book holder because i have lots of books. whenever i see interesting things on tv i would like to go to the mall and buy it. in my kitchen, i saw a microwave is not working anymore. on tv the commercial shows they are having a big sale in jcpenney. it cost about only sixty dollars. i think that is a good deal to buy a microwave for sixty dollars. i try to get a new laptop. but my budget is not enough to buy another computer. they are a pretty good deal for a dell computer in a market place. the computer market is having a pretty good mark down of price now. but when i get everything together, it cost over one thousnad dollars i need to spend all of it. i think the computer is popular consumer in the market. but i make a mind that i don't want to spend not much money, because it is not worth it. spending is not the way to feel better. how are you going to control your mind is better way to concern it. we are so busy living in collage life. everyone needs a rest in the weekend. shopping in a mall is good subject of good things to relax your mind. control you're budget and thinking of controlling your mind is the best way to think.

" i just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so i could read the things i need to read for my classes. the shower sure did wake me up! a girl living on my floor, whom i have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. so it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. this anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. so now i am here, listening to music and writing my stream of consciousness because i figured that this would be the best time since i have multiple feelings in me right now. in addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. he recently is taking a break with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. i told him, yeah, i know what you mean. i had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual. so instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. it took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. talking about them just made me a little sad. like i said, the break was really bad, so bad that i felt like there was no one who could understand what i was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. anyway, i tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. if only i could help him out with his sadness, but i know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. a break from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. i am content that i have no one tying me down, but i do miss the boyfriend'girlfriend relationship. if i do meet someone, then that is fine. if i do not, then that is fine too. when i entered college i promised myself that i would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. a huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. i have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud! there are plenty of fish in the sea. yes, college is great so far; i recently joined kung fu. it feels so good to be doing something you love again. i had to quit due to, once again, strict parents, but now that i'm back in the sport, the stress is less. i love watching it, and there are really athletic people in the class too. martial arts has always been a big interest to me. to be one of the few girls in the kung fu class is another bonus. not only am i surrounded by athletic guys, i also feel like i am special in a way, like i am unique. and i am better than most of the guys already. flexiblity and grace is key in wu shu kung fu, and i've got them both.

"i don't know what to feel or think. i am so overwhelmed with everything. i have felt this way for the past two weeks, but it just seems like it is all crashing today. i think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow. i feel like i have so much to do before we leave. i have so much homework everyday, and so much with my sorority, and i just want to have time to hang out and take it all in. not saying that i never have time, because i do, but not much. anyway, today we signed for our apartment next year. its so crazy that you have to do that this early here. but i am so excited about it. i'm living with my roommate, my suitemate, one of my pledge sisters, and both of her suitemates. it's going to be so awesome. so i had to pay that money today and in a couple of days, we have to pay like 600 dollars again, so that is a little crazy. i can't wait until i get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right. like i'm having a blast and everything, but i feel so busy. i missed my first class today because i was so behind on reading in another class. i'm hoping i can control myself with that and not miss too often. i feel so behind in most of my classes. three of my classes have been all reading, and that is so hard for me. i'm such a slow reader. i just need a weekend where i do nothing but homework and study, but i won't ever have that, because there's football here, and i like to have fun on the weekends. so, i love my sorority. they are all the sweetest group of girls. we have such an awesome pledge class. i'm living with one of my pledge sisters who i have become pretty close to her. i love her she is awesome. we had our pledge retreat last weekend, and i got to know so many more of the girls. i can't say too many good things about all of them. and i love the actives, too. the seniors have been so sweet to us. our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever. i love going there and feeling so loved by everyone, it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place. anyone of them would do anything for us, and that makes me feel so good, and safe. did i mention that i feel like i'm doing homework nonstop. haha. i really need to read tonight, i have to stay ahead. or rather get ahead. that is the one thing that i heard over and over again from college students: stay ahead on your work. i need to try harder to do that, because in high school i was such a procrastinator and i can't be like that here. i really need to do good, but does not everybody. especially since i want to get into the ppa program. my problem is, i can study when no one's here, and when everyone on my hall is sleeping or in class, but when they're all home, i love talking and goofing off with them. me and my suitemate love to dance so we always make up dances in front of the mirrors. i know, we're dorks, but we have fun. our hall in my dorm is so awesome. its crazy how close we got in such a short amount of time. i feel so lucky. even people on other floors in my dorm notice it, there like, i wish i was on your floor yall are so close. and we're always like, yeah we know. haha. but oh well. so me and courtney are going home tomorrow! i'm so excited. i want to see everyone so bad. i'm really excited to see my sister and my dog. i'm excited to see everyone, but i saw my mom and dad and one of my sisters last weekend at the football game. i have not seen my oldest sister since i moved down here. she is pregnant and due in october. i am so incredibly excited. its crazy. i say crazy a lot, but maybe because that is what my life is right now. and i can't wait to see my dog , ellie, either. i love her so much, and miss her so much. she is a dalmation and 10 years old and so cute and lazy and just likes to be pet. she is my favorite. i need to decide what i want my mom to cook for dinner tomorrow night. i am so ready for a home cooked meal. i wish i was staying a little longer. we're leaving tomorrow afternoon at like 1230, and then we're coming home on friday after the homecoming pep rally we're going to, because there's a football game here at 11 on saturday. and i'm not missing a football game here. i love college football, and i love texas football. it is so much fun. i have to go stand in line for ou tickets in the morning. i think i got a pretty good number, from what i here, so how awesome would that be if i got tickets my freshman year. that's going to be one crazy game, and its going to be so cool to get to go and actually be a part of the school. its going to be totally different than watching in still in high school. my birthday is in 2 weeks. i can't wait. i'm going home that weekend. so that will be really fun. i love birthdays. i'm so anxious for my sister to have her baby, its due in like 4 weeks, so you never know. she may have it early or she may have it late. her name is abby. and she is going to be the cutest thing ever. i can't wait to be an aunt. i hope she has chubby cheeks. i'm so excited. yay!

"my knuckles are aching i'm going to pop them, lot of clicking on the keyboards in the computer lab, i keep hearing a long beep ever now and then and it is really annoying, i wish i could type better and faster and not have to use one finger, my joints are still aching i want to constantly move to pop them, my head itches and my armpits are moist and sticky, i keep having to raise my arms to keep the stickiness down and more my shirt out of my pits, my toe needs to pop and my right ring finger itches, i wonder what jenn is doing i bet she is with gus, gosh do i hate that guy he just gets on my nerves and doesn't deserve her or treat her right, but then he is cool when i'm around very annoying, it rained earlier so it was really humid after psychology, but now the air conditioning in the library is just what i need, the back of my shoe has no fabric on it so where my sock is not present my shoe rubs blisters into the flesh, another chair squeaks as some shifts their weight, a guy is talking on his phone which i always thought was a bad idea and now he is done, the weird thing about this assignment is that all i'm really thinking about is the assignment and having to think things up, i feel like it doesn't accurately establish what i'm think because i i can't type as fast as a thought comes up, my eye is burning and i feel a tear coming up its like an uncontrollable itch that i'm going to have to rub for a while, another phone goes off, its amazing how many phones there are and how everyone has their own little ring, now someone won't answer their phone and it is still going off, my knee itches, i scratch it, a zipper is undone, another person leaves the computers, and another one sits down automatically, to guys are talking and kind of annoying me, walking around with their smug looks and acting like they own it all and don't have to abide by any rules of silence, that same beep again, i scratched my knee again, i wonder what i'm going to make for dinner, i'm really hungry right now but i still have my lab, stupid labs all at weird times and all out of whack, some one coughs over the loud and oddly rhythmic type emulating from about 50 computers, i shift my weight because my ass is falling asleep and cause my chair to creek as everyone takes a pause to listen look and become annoyed, more squeaking, and now my forearms are sore from resting on the edge of the table to long, i really worry about problems with my hands from typing and using a mouse and also from popping my knuckles, carri's dad has i guess a calcium deposit on his knuckle from clicking a mouse too much its pretty deformed looking, but funny, the library seems to weirdly old yet modern, a lot of the signs make me think of my elementary school and just stuff from then like the walls but its so enormous and imposing i completely stop thinking about it, i sneeze and cover my mouth but now i type so i spread my saliva everywhere i feel bad for who ever uses this next, knuckles again, some guy is looking out if the window and i want to know what he is thinking and what he is looking at, i was thinking about this one think dr. pennebaker was talking about how we are all programmed to react to movement and sound, i guess i always knew and tried to avoid it but i don't think many people actually think about it, i think its actually pretty cool because i'm now thinking about how it is one those derived characteristics we got from our ancestors i guess who hunted or had natural predators just being able to react when ever something moved or made a noise, probably a good thing not to evolve out of, 311 rocks evolver is a good step up for them, i notice i get really startled easily when i'm alone in my room engulfed in tv or a computer, my mom and anyone can come in and say hi and ill jump like the dickens even though it was not that big of a deal i wish jenn felt the same way it would be nice and also bad because ",1,-0.283057 -0.361247 -0.789144 -0.600397 -0.896326 -0.281985 0.808853 -0.153781 0.308571 0.44331 5.788842 -0.590446 -0.104342 -0.74528 0.264056 0.0 -0.04277 -0.255958 -0.337527 -0.182625 -0.405297 -0.742368 0.063414 -0.752948 -0.624052 0.213001 0.052178 -0.279043 -0.697833 -1.434034 -1.100231 -1.136887 0.565175 -0.193836 0.434694 -0.466118 -0.323008 0.41042 0.040945 -0.809355 -0.065054 0.006448 -0.179231 0.972997 0.221156 0.273402 1.52049 -0.354874 0.206798 -0.162777 -0.053837 -0.783402 -0.712 -0.491785 -1.518843 0.139502 0.415453 1.222588 0.727937 -0.990205 -0.262343 -1.083691 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.198292 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.343159 1.847086 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.455411 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.094043 4.421961 3.954858 4.720427 4.444962 5.18804,1929
"i am so completely upset with my mother. we used to be so close and now she has turned evil on me! she's mad about my cell phone bill, well then why did she buy it for me? i called her the majority of the time anyway. it's not like i was calling danny or christie! i think i- aggh, she seriously thinks i have nothing better to do up here then listen to her bitch about money. i'm trying to earn a college education so i don't have to worry about money. not that a degree will magically erase all of life's problems, but it will always let me have something to fall back on. i wish i didn't have so much to do. i have a t least 2 chapters to read for each class, and i overslept this morning, so i missed geography! oops, i'm seriously not too interested in how the prehistoric man evolved into what we are today, but it seems rather important that i memorize it all now for the sake of the essay test yet to come. what's that all about anyway, essaytests? why not just give mc tests like the rest of the world? how boring would that be to read 300 essays over geography? feel kinda bad for that man. i think that college should come with a scheduled in nap time. everyone gets tired, it should just be one extra hour where you take your mat and blanket just like in kindergarden and go to your assigned building and sleep! if you show up you get a c if you doze off and on you get a b and if you knonk out you get an a! sounds good doesn't it! it could count as an elective, and those with the hardest classes and the furthest to walk would get to register first! i'm so smart i scare myself!! just kidding, well. i still need to find brown shoes. brown dress shoes, i have this brown dress to wear to this 75th anniversary party, and i don't have shoes! i feel kinda like the girl in clueless. ohmygod, no shoes whatever will i do? seriously, after i enactmy nap time plan, i am going to create a brown dress shoe company. i will make a fortune, because i will be the only person in the world that makes brown shoes! one day. i have a monster headache, i think it's my contacts, i should probably change them, has it been two weeks? i don't think so! i'm a responsible person, i just forget to do things sometimes! i had to got to the postoffice today. that was neat. i had no idea what i was doing and i felt like a dumb teenage girl who had never been in any sort of public ""official"" place. i'll try to stay away from there. well it's been 20 min! goodbye!

"well i'm a bit nervous about this. not that i really have any reason to be nervous, but college in general has been all new to me and a bit scary and overwhelming. i'm really tired right now, but i can't go to sleep because i have so much to do. my body is getting so run down. i really ought to take care of myself, i know. well, i did go to yoga today. besides, if i go to bed early, my roomie will stay up and make noise, something that makes me unable to sleep. unfortunately, only i have early morning classes. not her. but i love jenny. best friend, ya know. oh well. i wish i could have more time to study though. then i would have more time to sleep. then i would enjoy life a bit more, i think. i liked hearing in psych today that everyone is stressed first semester of freshman year. i truly did think i was the only one. well yippee! i'm not alone! although, i don't think everyone is juggling 15 hours, with work, organizations, and a lot of time-consuming friends! but i guess a lot of people have their own time problems. like if they are in a frat or sorority or something. those apparently take a lot of time. that's totally not my kind of thing though, so i'm glad that i'm not doing it. also, being in sports takes a lot of time i'm sure. band too. brandon is in band. he says it's a lot of fun, but i think it wouldn't be my thing either. unless they sang in band. in which case, i would really enjoy it. or dance. dance is awesome. i really miss it. but you know, when i went clubbing this weekend, i really hated it. i hated how guys treated me like a piece of meat and basically violated my personal space and being. i felt like crap. i really hated it. and the thing is, i really wanted to hit the library that night, but nooooo, they said i would enjoy the club because it was salsa dancing - one of my favorites. wouldn't you know it - they had like one salsa song. man, that was upsetting. it turned out to be a horrible night. i mean, horrible. jenny is going to bed now. that's a first. she always goes to bed after me. seriously, that's a first. i hope i don't wake her by typing. actually my comp is kind of quiet now that i think about it. besides, she claims she is not disturbed by little sounds. so good. i don't think it'll be too much of a problem. my head hurts. and this light shining on my keyboard is actually making my fingers hot. that's kind of creepy. i don't think lights are supposed to do that. oh well. i really have to use the bathroom now. hah. i bet that's a psychological thing. i only feel that way just because i know i can't leave the computer because i've got 12 more minutes left. how does this thing work? how can this computer tell me what my psyche is like? i mean, its a computer! how is it able to read what i have written, and then analyze it and give me a response? hehe, maybe the tas have to stay at the computer 24-7 so they can write in the responses. hehe. sorry, mr. ta. i know that's not funny. oh my god it's late. i'm talking to the non-existent ta, i'm so tired. well if it weren't for all that studying i tried to finish, it wouldn't be so late! but of course, even after spending almost every free moment i had today, reading, i still am not even anywhere near catching up in reading! it's all because of that stupid, stupid sociology class i dropped! i'm seriously upset about that! i mean, that class was by far the hardest class in terms of reading assignments. if only i had add'dropped the class sooner, i wouldn't have wasted all of my precious time on that one class. and then i end up switching sociology classes. man. i make myself so mad sometimes. well, hey. i am a freshman and new to all of this stuff. i guess it'll just take me awhile to figure all these things out. ut is so huge. i don't know if i will ever get used to the size. actually, i'm not sure it's fully hit me yet anyway. but how on earth did i end up here? i was headed for famous, private colleges in the northeast, that were small, which was my main want in a college. yet i've ended up at the biggest! alex is calling on my cell. poor guy. he is had such a rough night. but hey bub. i'm doing my homework right now. i hope he doesn't think that i'm ignoring him. well i am, i guess. but i do plan on calling him back. although that would mean sacrificing more sleep, but oh well. he needs someone right now. i think that's also a problem i have. i spend to much time with my friends. too many friends sometimes. sometimes it seems like there aren't enough. strange how that is. well i know online (aim) i definitely have enough friends to talk to. that's so hard. aim always sucks me in because i get to talk to people who live far away and that i never get to see. i waste so much valuable time on that! ugh. i procrastinate too much. well, no, that's not true. i spend a lot of time doing important things. and i guess aim and hanging out with friends are my way of relaxing and taking a break. although they really aren't breaks. because they require so much emotion, and attention, and energy! so then i need even more sleep! but that's just something i can't ever get! same with in high school! ugh. i was such an overachiever. all that for nothing though. ut didn't even look at all the extra work i did. replacing lunch for a class. not having any free time because of all the organizations and officer positions. so much going on. and all ut looked at was the fact that i was in the top 2%. whoopee. now i'm in. i think that makes ut a lot less prestigious. for that very reason, ut was my backup school. because it was so easy for me to get into. ooh, time is almost over. last thoughts, anj? no. i keep thinking about sleep. hehe. i can't get it off my mind. maybe that's a sign. but i need to call alex. eeks. jenny is moving. did i wake her up? oh, i can continue? nah. i think this is enough. besides, i need sleep!

"the class is very interesting. the psychology class i took in high school was rather boring. i planned to be a psychologist, perhaps clinical. after taking the class, i was turned off at the idea. this class has renewed my interest and has caused me to begin thinking again (finally). at this point, i just looked at my watch and realized i have only been typing for three minutes. i am not sure what else to say. the first idea that came into my head was my car. i own a 1971 dodge charger. it is a nice car and is also quite fast. it used to belong to my father, and he gave it to me. we got it out of storage in 1993. at that point, we began to restore it, a job that still isn't fully complete. my high school experience was a strange one. i spent my first three years in texas. for my senior year, i had to move to oklahoma. while there, i realized that i matured mentally. i thought about the differences in society, and how people only a few hundred miles part can vary so much. i am glad to be in college now. the classes are not what i had expected them to be. to succeed, one must be very self motivated. i am finding it slightly difficult to get things done at times. cafeteria food is another factor on my mind. first of all, most of the time i don't like the food. next, when i am hungry, there isn't anything to eat. the cafeteria is closed for some reason. i don't know. nothing more is coming to mind, other than the dull glow of my computer screen. my time has elapsed, so i will finish by saying that. i can't think of anything to finish with.

"today if the first sunday that i have been here alone and it is interesting because i don't have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. i can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before i would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and i need to take a shower. i didn't get up till about 11:45. the mtv music video awards and not very exciting and i am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. michael jackson does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they don't seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. i wonder if this is going to get through because i cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class i have ever been in. i hope it is the most interesting. i need to check how much money is in my account. i came with alot and am still wondering how much i will leave with. dana carvey is a funny guy and i figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. i miss running track. i need to go and workout but will when i'm done. hanson is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it i know that i can. i am really infatuated with this girl and hope that i run into her again, actually there are two that i am. eddie murphy is a pimp. i cant believe that princess diana died. i think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. i do not know how long i've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. i feel like beavis and butthead because i am verbalizing all of my thoughts. i stayed up till three o'clock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by aerosmith, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. i still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. i need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because i miss listening to them. i still seems i haven't written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. daisy fuentes is hot and i'm glad that she is not bald. what is marilyn masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and i had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe that's why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. i kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because i have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. i have done absolutely nothing today and i thoroughly like it. i do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. i wonder how many people only take showers every other day. i wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes.

"well hello there, i just decided to start my writing assignment. i'm bored since my roommate, travis, for class so i decided to do this assignment today. i hope it isn't boring. it seems like an easy assignment, and since i'm not the best writer i'm grateful. i'm not the best typist either. it's a lot different typing something to hand in compared to typing to your friends online. my nose hurts and i'm tired. my throat tastes bad too. hmmm what else. this is kind of a weird assignment. i have too many thoughts to write them all down, and i can't type fast enough. i'm struggling here as it is. for every thought i write down, a couple more are being wasted because of my bad typing skills. i keep having to go back and fix all of my typos. i have to call my friend today. i'll do it after i'm done with this. i saw a funny download about some coffee bean that was like the matrix. i liked it a lot, but i can't find the site where he got it, so i guess i have to call him. also i didn't call him back last night either. i'm using the idea where you type it in notepad first then you paste it to the web, but i'm not sure if it's coming out the right way. i don't want to do this again, so i hope it works. i have to go turn down the air cause it's freezing in here, i can barely feel my fingers. there, it feels better already. i wonder what george is doing now too. he went out with me last night. i don't have anymore classes today, and i want to do something cool. i do have to do laundry. i'm not sure if that is how you spell it though. the bag is getting big and smelly. i have to clean before my old girlfriend visits. she is very nice and beautiful. i'm mad because we broke up. long distance relationships don't work, but we still liked each other a lot. so far i haven't seen any girls here that i want to go out with. i'm not sure if it's because i really like laura still or because my standards are a lot higher now. this is kind of fun just telling you everything, i'm doing my best now not to remember something really embarrassing that i would have to type to you. i think this is what a diary or journal would be like if i decided to keep one. i always wanted to do that, but i don't have the time. in second grade our class had to do one and draw pictures of our day too. i liked doing it and i tried to keep doing it but it just wasn't the same. i just lost the motivation to do it. it's always fun to read my old second grade one though. i was such a dork back then though. not that i'm mr. popular now though. it sucks here because at high school i knew everyone and had lots of friends. now i still have some of my friends but it will take sometime before i know what's happening on the weekends. i still really want to meet a girl here, but i just haven't seen any that i really like. i just don't want to go up to random girls and ask for their number either. personally i think i'm selling our if i do that. i'm not sure why but i feel stupid, like i'm trying to be somebody that i'm not. i just glanced at the clock and i have about a minute left so i'm going to stop now. i'm pretty impressed with my work here. i hope you like it, if you read it.

"i'm at my grandmother's house and it's pouring rain. i was supposed to go to this meeting for the texas sweethearts but since it's raining i'm not going to go. even though the social events aren't required its going to bug me all night wondering if the current sweethearts are going to hold it against me. even though i know other people probably won't go i still feel like i will stick out as not going and i don't know if that's a good or bad thing. i really don't know. i couldn't be any more tired. i waited in line for 5 in a half hours to get a ticket to the texas-ou game. it was so chaotic. it's amazing to see how much people will pay for those tickets. some people were going as high as $300 for one ticket that they sell for $75. luckily i got one and i'm so happy. i had to go to work after that and it felt like i had just gone swimming because i was drenched in sweat. i looked so bad and i went in 2 hours late. i thought i was going to get fired. i'm going to stay at my grandma's house since it's raining, i wonder what i'm going to wear? why do i care so much? people go to school looking ten times worse than me and no one cares, but i can't get myself to go to school without makeup. i wish i wasn't so self-conscious. it's weird, you always think you look fine until it comes someone else's turn to judge you than you get nervous about what they think. who cares? that's how i wish i could feel. even though i wear sweat shorts and t-shirts to school i still care if they match or i wonder if i wore it last week. why can't i stop caring about what people might think about me? i bet no one even pays attention to me. i really don't know if i'm vain for thinking that people look at me or insecure because i care if they do. i can't believe my boyfriend hasn't called me yet. i met this girl yesterday at the sweetheart meeting and she seemed so cool. we talked and got along and she drove me to my car and we were going to go to the social together. when i called her though she didn't seem the same she was just like oh, it's you or i don't know. maybe i expect to much out of people. it just seemed to me that she was being fake yesterday by the way she was acting towards me today. i can't wait until time is up, but it actually hasn't seemed that long. i didn't really think this would be this easy. i guess you can tell things to a computer and it won't tell you to shutup after you complain to much. i wonder if i should read for my class tomorrow? i feel so exhausted like i haven't slept in days and today wore me out. i feel like i could sleep for three days. hopefully pretty soon i'll catch on to this whole college thing. i have exactly 45 seconds and i really don't know what to write so i'm just going to say that i am soooooooooooooooooooooooo happy that i got a texas-ou ticket again because it the best thing that has happened in a while.

" so here i sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is i'm really thinking, well. i'm thinking of days that seem so far from where i am, the hope of the past i guess you could say. i'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, i'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago, what is your purpose for living? . i told her i had none. that today i awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. this was a lie of course, i have purpose, a goal, just one that i am now comming to relize i can't reach. so what do i do? i think thats what i'm think about most, what now. i'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and i wonder what story they have to tell. i need a cigeret. hold on. god bless nicotine. it is wonderful drug. many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am i going to do today about it, nothing. i can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. i'm considering what i should do about the z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. god i hate her friends, and all there insocients and nieveness, if thats a word. i really don't think i can handle there crap, and i deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly i don't know what to do. i'd like to go off on him tell him what i think of him and all his crap but i don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. i need to go buy books. but i probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. anyway. so there i was in the mists of a great opertunity and i didn't let it pass me by and yet i'm still here. whats up with that. what is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. a whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but i really don't feel like typing them. ok. now what. i see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do, never felt so alone, never felt so alive. but then again. but there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but i just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. a regular kobi oshi maro, no win sinerio. well crap! what to do. i have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. what to do? well there is always another option, a path less taken. away out. i just don't see it, i need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. what to do? ok, best case sinerio i don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly i'll get shit. i do something and things are only worse. i leave, and i make everyone pissed. give and i hurt, take and i hurt others, forget. if i could forget i think i would, but you know, that really never works for me. i can hide, i can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something i'm good at. i have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. so i go, i say hello, i leave. thats what i'll do, and then, i'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. ok so now what. i'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. i really don't have anything to say either. i mean really what is there to say, i'm sad, i'm not at the top of my game. but that will all change, and i think that frustrates me. that there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do i do to influence change, how do i minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally i'm very good at that, but lately, i guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how. but i see them in other peoples lives, maybe i've lost disipline, i let go for to long, and need to take up the ",1,0.083167 -0.76791 0.660278 -1.416957 -0.346036 -0.515497 -1.863596 -1.248237 -1.245 0.693229 -0.162249 0.350289 -0.841482 -0.20099 -1.105327 0.0 -0.04277 -0.257669 0.178612 -0.795527 -0.02578 -0.19289 -0.760379 2.374191 1.074683 0.032036 -0.120166 -0.714561 -0.131895 -0.494963 -0.822444 0.468277 0.365737 -0.57742 0.992819 0.374565 1.810213 -0.378425 0.90476 0.65615 2.106064 0.388235 1.221968 0.702346 0.601491 0.133215 0.83627 -1.06231 0.390182 -0.937713 -1.148102 -0.555704 -0.820717 0.81285 -0.359587 0.01428 -1.058713 -0.45205 -0.502565 0.725469 1.156254 0.306176 0.585922 -0.745201 1.382986 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.133855 3.480006 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.264182 -0.224065 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.57579 -0.451544 -0.408772 1.47 4.837885 3.998704 4.052689 4.781008 4.754687,1861
" well, i feel good about the fact that i am getting this assignment done well before it is due. today is one of those days that i feel really motivated to do my homework, as opposed to those days in which i don't do anything worthwhile. the excitement of college is starting to wear off and i think that the reality of the fact that i am here is finally sinking in. i really hate the way this typing field doesn't automatically move the sentence down to the next line! i really don't seem to be thinking about anything interesting right now. i am just feeling average, not extremely excited or unhappy. i really cannot think of anything to type. i think my mind is clearing itself like it usually does when i sit down to right a paper. no stray thoughts seem to be coming to me. i am fairly excited about this psychology course. i think this course will not only be very interesting but helpful as well because i plan to go into medicine. boy, this twenty minutes is going by slowly. i think i might be typing too much too fast. perhaps i am supposed to sit and wait till a thought comes to me before i type. i have tried to type in my current thoughts and feelings. my roommate is typing on his computer as well, annoying. now he has turned on his fan, which is fairly loud . he switched it off. still no stray thoughts. i guess composing these sentences are thoughts. this assignment is all i am thinking about right now. four minutes to go. three minutes to go. i have to go out and buy an answering machine today. i have to get back before nine so i can make the upper east jester floor meeting. free pizza will be there! i hope its double dave's. oh, they have good pepperoni rolls, i don't know about their pizza. well, it has been 20 minutes.

"i wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 69 degrees in my room. i had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and i'm generally a hot natured person. the thought of winter coming makes me really excited. i like summer, but it just stays too hot. maybe i should have gone to college in colorado or somewhere a lot cooler. i don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. i'm just always hot. i get it from my dad, he is the same way. we are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. joseph was another person i could do that with, but i never see him anymore. he should come down and visit, i know he likes it in austin. i am surprised that i am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. i don't even live in the same town anymore, i'm 3 and a half hours away, why does it matter. maybe if i had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, i wouldn't care as much. so far, i have been really disappointed with the college parties i have been to. they are nothing like the ones on tv, which i know tv isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). i almost wish i hadn't brought my tv, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. i need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. i would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so i might as well make myself as popular as possible here. the more people you know the better off you are. if that's true, i'm in trouble. the friends that i had down here before i moved are still my friends, but i want to find my own group. i feel welcome among my other friends, but i don't feel at home. i have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. the fig is stupid. when i signed up for it, the only reason i did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. there is one girl in there i'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. i tell myself i'm going to talk to people when i sit next to them in class, but every time i end up convincing myself not to. in my hometown of boyd, tx, there were about 350 students in my high school, so i knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. now i'm going to a school of over 50,000 students. no one would even know if i didn't show up for a month. in boyd, i'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. i sometimes just watch the clock when i'm bored, like in church. this weekend will be the best one so far. i am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. plus, i want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that i find attractive. i'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. dress to impress. i never go out looking worse than i want people to see me as. it's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. i am nothing special here. there is nothing that i can do, or that i know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. that has been a really humbling experience.

"looking at this assignment i'm trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that i want a good grade. like every other student, i don't like doing homework but i writing so it is okay. i have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend. i know i should have done this earlier but i am a procrastinator and i often wait until the last minute. i am slowly changing that habit because i know i can't procrastinate if i want to do good in school. my feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because i don't know what i am suppose to be feeling. i am just writing what comes to my mind. honestly i don't even understand the topic. all i know is that i'm suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind. i know this has nothing to do with school but i keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston. i was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldn't let her come up to austin. it is okay because i know i'll see her next weekend. i was going to write this earlier like on friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so i didn't find time to write this assignment. so far i like the class because it is the only one that interests me. all my other classes are boring. the is the only class that i enjoy the lectures in. i'm not saying this just to make the professor happy. i'm saying this because i mean it. i am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now. oh yeah, i think the experiments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade. i thought about writing the research papper because i think that might be easier but i think the experiments would be funner. i have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice. i also met some of my friends that i already knew who came here from houston just like me. i have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it i am. i don't know how long i have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind. i thought i would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that i am not. i just keep writing until i don't know what else to write. well things are starting to stop coming into my mind. all i am thinking about is how i can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop. will i think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting, anxious, lost, suprise, and not understanding. this has been a interesting paper because i have no idea what i have been writing. well i guess ill push the submit button now.

" oh boy, the first writing assignment. i hope i am doing this correctly. i can't really think of anything else right now. i sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. i am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can i say. i am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. i don't know what i feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so i guess its a little warm in here. i can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. i guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 20 min of writing sure will suck. well, i still don't know what to think. i'm still bored. i'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company i enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and i occasionally see her on the weekends, although i've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now i'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. i'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but i think i had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when i when i bought it using his credit card account. i guess i thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but i ignored his call because i am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, i like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy i know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although i'm a passivist, i hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. i thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, i think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. i wonder how they're doing. its been a while since i last talked to almost any of them, and i just wonder how they're doing. maybe i should go up there sometime. although i have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. i'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now i'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. i think his parents weren't too happy about it, because i've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but i ignored his call as well. now i'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy i've know for almost 18 or 19 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. i'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase i know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although i'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, i know he'll be happy, and for that reason, i too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, i hope that this will end soon. and now i see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and i, which i don't thin she should do. i think i'll stop her when i'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till i'm done. yippie.

"it was very frustrating to get on to the web site. however, the weekends are fun. i get to see my friends that are not at this school. this weekend i went home to see one of my friends who signed with the kansas city royals. i also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. one goes to tcu and the other goes to tomball community college. he was supposed to go to georgia to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. now he is writing other colleges and the yale coach called him. if he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. i also got to see my boyfriend. he goes to baylor. he was my best friend first and now we are together. it is great. however, i miss him a lot. he is the sweetest guy i know. anyway, right now i am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. it is really a pain. i need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my ethernet card. it is not compatible with my laptop. i am right now in the school of business. however, i am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. my dad thinks this is a terrible idea. my mom thinks i should do what will make me happy. i guess i need to get as much information as i can about the type of jobs that i can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school i will have to complete. i will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. i really do not want to go here next year. i want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. i will probably stay in the state. i will probably go to a&m of baylor. oh well, i guess i have a while to decide.

"i don't have to right in paragraph form or write any sentence structures or even spell right. i don't have to put any grammar or punctuation on this assignment and i can talk about anything. i don't understand what the point of this assignment is and i don't care as long as i finish it. so i guess i'll just keep typing and typing and typing. right now, i feel an itch so i'll scratch my arm. i'm typing on my friends computer, so he can't use it for at least another seventeen minutes. i don't think understand the point of this assignment. i could do this: and nobody would care. this assignment is just to type for twenty minutes about whatever i think and i keep thinking this over and over again. i don't know what i'm doing and i don't care as long as i finish. i started at 2:28p. m so i'll stop at 2:48p. m. man it's another fifteen minutes until i finish. i'm tired and i want to go back to sleep. i need to do my laundry, clean the bathroom, do my homework. that reminds me i have so much homework to do. i don't understand anything in calculus and i'm worried about that class. my final is fifty percent of my grade!!!! i don't understand why some teachers would do that. it's like the semester grade depends on this one test. if you were making an a in the class, before the final, you could end up failing if you really screw up on the final. what kind of class is that??? i don't know but i'm scared. i have to study hard for that final, but first i have to understand the material we're covering right now. i'm so behind. but the good thing about the final is that it's my only final and i have a week to study for it so i should do o. k. i hope i get a b in this class. i don't want to do any homework, and that reminds me that i'm behind in all of my classes!!!! i have to read so much and i don't like to read. i think i'm going crazy. i need to write this assignment do the second writing assignment, read for theatre, do calculus homework, read for this class, do a peer review sheet for english, and chores around the house. so much to do, so little time. only 9 more minutes to go. oh, and the pretest survey to see what surveys i will be used in, was messed up. i didn't start reading the top of the survey which tells you what answers to fill in until the middle. so i think the survey thinks i'm a girl, since i answered some female only questions. except i checked the male box when it asked whether i was male or female. but it kept on asking me questions that were very feminine. i hope i don't get in trouble for that. but i doubt it, since there will probably be other people who will do the exact same thing i did. there's always somebody else. i hope i don't get put into some strange category or something. what i didn't understand about the survey was that why did it ask some of the same questions over again. i think it had to do something with me answering female only questions. i don't know if that's why but i answered most all of them except this one question that asked if i was more guilty about eating than most girls. i was like: ""hold up, what's going on? this survey thinks i'm a girl!"" damn, well whatever it's o. k. everybody makes mistakes and i'm not going to come down on myself because of that. my friends staring at my assignment right now and saying this is an easy assignment. well i guess it is, it's just that my fingers are tired. i don't want to type anymore, and i have 2 more minutes left. yippee!!!! after this i'm going to take a break and then do writing assignment number 2. after i finish that i'll take a nap and start on calculus. oh man, so much work to do!!! i should have started earlier instead of playing these first few weeks of school. well my time's up. so goodbye!!!

"tonight i get to go to a date dash function with my new sorority. some of my friends set me up with a guy that i have never met before. i can't wait to meet him. i hope he is nice and at the same time, good looking! this week has been good. all my classes are going well, so i feel confident about them and life in general. lunch today was especially good, since i haven't eaten a real meal in a few days. i love college. it's so good to not have to worry about a curfew and letting my parents know exactly where i am going to be, etc. i love my roommate, and we have almost the same schedule, so that works out perfectly. last night, i typed an extrememly long letter to a friend that i hadn't talked to in a few weeks, so my fingers are still kind of tired from typing then. that's ok, though, because i am getting some homework done early, so that i don't have to worry about it later on. that is definitely a good feeling. i am also feeling excited because i saw two guys on campus this morning that i know from high school. ever since the first day of classes, i had been wanted to see someone i knew. it just happens that those two that i saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that i know. lucky me! this gum that i'm chewing is from a blow pop that i finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. those things never last long at all. i have a problem with one of my classes. see, i swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and i want to continue in college, but every time i want to do something, the class is in the way. i've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. that is very stressful. i don't know if i should change it to an early time because then, i would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. but then at least i'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. but would i have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like i usually do? no, i don't think i would. let's see. which is more important? i guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. i just don't know. wow, i have like nine minutes left. this isn't such a bad assignment. psychology is actually really fun. i've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. i hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because i'm not that great at analyzing and stuff. i took psychology in high school, and it was way different. my teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. it was the easiest class ever! i am going home to houston this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. we are all going to go see clay walker, my favorite country singer. my ex-boyfriend will also be in town. i haven't seen him in over two months. he goes to west point in new york and had to leave in late june. i talk to him every once in awhile, but i miss him so much. we are still great friends, and i can't wait to see him again. we dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. this gum is really ready to be thrown away, but i'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. i have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. those are never stressful, since the t. a. just helps us with some problems like our homework. he's a nice guy. the first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but i'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. at least i hope so. getting to know people is good, but i really needed some help with a couple of those problems! well, i guess it has been twenty minutes, so i better go. hope anyone who reads this is having a great time! :) ",0,0.669915 -1.327514 0.540126 -0.617251 -0.344417 0.460682 -0.102759 -0.776741 -0.295248 0.447096 -0.172049 -0.104134 -0.380359 0.505735 0.353466 0.0 -0.04277 -0.701652 -0.498713 1.448934 -0.135995 -0.742368 -0.617448 -0.10271 -0.164426 0.395585 -0.291271 0.542372 0.6031 1.427833 -0.498945 0.624537 -0.660375 0.516554 -1.017959 -0.466933 -0.578133 -0.028186 0.037711 -0.162472 0.906153 -0.429205 1.492406 0.239033 1.592902 -0.862494 -0.04922 -0.406002 -0.71475 -0.303702 -0.270727 1.820371 0.165339 0.08783 -0.067859 -1.209612 0.181686 -0.954251 0.908603 -0.479581 0.294023 0.205129 -0.480161 -0.045244 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.125815 1.226175 0.050986 -0.23436 -0.135947 0.428888 -0.153687 -0.422267 0.075888 -0.451544 -0.178563 0.450862 5.117838 3.686835 4.935007 4.948824 4.430933,366
"today is labor day. this weekend i went to my family reunion in noccona, tx. my cousin, tracey, is recently engaged. i am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, i am a little bit jealous. i know i am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. my brother has been married a little more than four years. when he first married, i did not think too much about it. now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. my parents have been married 31 years! i cannot believe it. in today's world where divorce is a commonplace, i am proud of my parents for sticking together. my parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a yorkie. her name is brittnay, and i love her with all of my heart. i was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. i think i miss her more than anyone else, probably because i get to talk to other people on the phone. brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and i cannot wait until i see her again. college life is so much different than high school. i t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. i really do not feel older. for some reason, i always feel young. when i think about all the petty gossipy things i worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. once people enter college they change so much. for instance, i have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. however, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. i am really concerned about my grades. i really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. i want to be a child psychologist. psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. i love children, and i also love helping people. i figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. when i become a mom, i want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. this way, i can spend lots of time with my own children. i also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. if i worked all day, i do not think i would have time. this summer i started cooking, and i found that it is quite enjoyable. it is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. i would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. i also need to find a job. i did not realize how much money college consumes. i feel bad asking my parents for money. plus, i worked at the pottery, a local shop in midland, for a little more than a year, so i am not used to needing money from my parents. my mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. i love my parents'family very dearly. they are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that i have ever known. my family is also very generous. i just hope that i will turn out to be the kind of people they are.

"i need to learn better time management skills. i'm so glad that i can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. oh wow! what's up with that teacher? i do feel sorry for her though. i know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. afterall, i was only on the computer last night for four hours. and i can't believe i allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! but you know what? i figured out that i can get a lot of work done as long as i do it outside of my dorm room. i also figured out why people say silence is golden. (though personally, i don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) oh my gosh! i totally found a gift from god today! i was sitting in the study lounge in jester only to stumble upon a study group for 408k. and it was definitely a blessing to finally get into teranchi's class. i can't believe theresa and my new friends are in there. though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. now i can email theresa or maybe call up katherine. (i talked to katherine today infront of jesta pizza and she's taking 408k too. ) i got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 408k homework. the only thing i'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that coco and rubes are in this new class as well. i'm not sure if i'm at a stage where i could answer questions as i'm trying to learn them myself. and though it sounds kind of bad, i really need to get an 'a' in 408k. maybe i can review it this weekend and then i might be able to help them next week. oh wow, next week! i have tests coming out of nowhere! but today was refreshing considering the fact that i'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. if i can do that in one day. time management here i come! it's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. well once i'm done with this maybe i'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. oh yeah, uh huh! i kind of wish i was a speed reader. i wonder if i'd actually get to party a lot more. dude, screw the parties me and henna are going to build a fort. how cool is that? that's just too cool! oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and pow there's your fort. oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous.

"i enjoy my life so much right now, but i am also at a really tuff time in my life right now. i love austin and ut, but my boyfriend lives back home. things are great between us, but it is so hard not being able to see him everyday. i miss the little things, like just being able to drive 5 minutes to go to his house, now it takes me over three hours to go to his house. i guess though that when i do get to see him, that the time we spend together is more valuable. i never realized how much we took for granted the fact that we used to live so close together. now just to hear his voice costs money. i miss him so much. i have faith that things will work out between us, it is just going to be a long hard road through college. we have a lot of growing up to do though too. we both have a huge jealously problem, which is part of the reason we broke up the first time we were together. whenever trusted each other enough to let the other one go out with their friends, so we were always together, and eventually i guess we just got bored of each other. i think the biggest mistake we ever made, was breaking up because a lot of things happened during the time we were broken up that puts strain on our relationship now. although i have to thank my parents for sending me down to provisionals this summer, because when i left, adam realized that if we did not work things out soon, we were never going to be together again, because i was not going to wait around for him. i love adam so much, i thank god everyday that i met him. he has been my best friend for three years now, and i couldn't think of anyone that has helped me through as much stuff as he has. he has always been there for me, except for when we broke up, and he only left because it hurt him to be around me. other than that adam is the person that has helped me through the toughest times in my life. no matter what happened during the day, adam can always make me feel better. he can make all my worries fade.

"here i go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the texas hill conutry. useraly the frist thing i notce are the ceder trees, and while i like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. this is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.

"well as i was clicking on the button that allows you to begin, i noticed that i forgot the last digit of my social security number, aka, ut eid. well for whoever care, it is 7. my i'd number is 449712047. there now i can get credit for this assignment. anyway, i don't know what to write about. i'm sure that after a while your stream of consciousness"" i totally spelled that wrong, will take over. i bet everyone writes this at the beginning of their assignment just because they don't know what else to write about and aren't bored enough to be honest yet. so i am really mad about my laptop. last night is just turned white and shut down. i tried turning it on this morning and it wouldn't so i took it to the its or something like that. it is the place where they are supposed to fix your computer. well they didn't. nope they just gave ma 1 8oo number to call which took me 20 minutes and i still didn't talk to a real person. i always type didn't instead of didn't. that is annoying. so i took the battery out of my computer and it works now but i still need a new battery which better be under warranty because i just got the thing in may. so i go to check my e mail and what do you know, i have another freaking virus on my computer. i am about to scream. seriously, i am using my roommates computer right now. it is the second one since i got here in june and it is pissing me off. i mean i am not even one of those internet surfing kids, i just use it for research and e mail and papers and stuff so i don't even know how i got the dang thing. so now i have decided to type with the correct hand position so my typing is considerably slower and my spelling considerably poorer. ya screw this. i wish i would have paid attention in keyboarding class. man, i am only half way done. so this is my roommate's computer. she is sleeping right now. don't get me wrong, i love the girl to death but she is freaking emotional. it was her and her boyfriends 1 year anniversary today. i don't think he is good for her. my arm is starting to hurt. i know why it is because here in jester you have no freaking desk space and the fridge is shoved into your back. in kinsolving it was heaven. i miss it there a lot better community. my professor was talking about freshman insecurity or whatever today. he was right. i don't consider myself to be an insecure person but college will do it to ya, especially when you don't know anyone. i bet there are people like me who can just sit here and type crap, never letting on to what they are really thinking about. i obviously already have a little, but to tell you the truth, i am really thinking about how bad i am at typing. i don't know why i think i have to type fast for this. it isn't like you are counting my words. actually, it is just making it harder for me to continue my bullshit, excuse the french. why do people say that? i think my dog back home is depressed. i know she misses me, i'm the only one she liked. she is always at my neighbor's house because they let her in and feed her. the sad thing is, i think my neighbor is trying to replace her husband with my odg. they just got divorced, one of the super religious couples you would never expect to. she is such a softie anyway. ya i def think that she is using my dog for company. i don't know why though because she already has two dogs of her own. ok well i have this meeting to go to tonight. it is for the lassos, no wait, the lonestars. i can't forget to call my friend lindsay or is it lindsey so we can meet to walk there. ya i am about to nope, i just did sneeze. god bless me. i think everyone should believe in god. he is great even if there is no proof, that is where faith comes in right? right.

"right now i am in my friend's jester dorm to do my writing 1 with her computer. i will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the u. t. campus are always full. it is really annoying when i have to wait to use a computer. i just don't have time to wait, since i have so much homework to do. i feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. people told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. i am still not use to living in the dorm. it is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. i miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. i am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. my leg and arm muscles are aching, since i played basketball and worked out at the rec center yesterday. i like the facility there. there is a good variety of things to do. i plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. the boyz ii men new song called ""the four seasons"" is in my head right now. i enjoy listening to the song. it sounds very sweet and peaceful. the song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at u. t. i am now listening to the movie called ""space jam. "" my sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. i saw the movie about half a year ago. i thought it was a very cute movie. it is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. my favorite basketball player, michael jordan, is one of the main characters in the movie. i like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. it is so cool when michael makes a slam dunk. he really does fly a little. i hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. i hope i won't be very nervous when i go into my classes. i have four classes to go to tomorrow! i am really excited about seeing my senior u. t. cousin tomorrow!

"it seems to me that the purpose of this assignment is not really to examine our mundane thoughts that we perceive but the logic behind the way our mind thinks. since most my time is spent analyzing my thoughts and their processes i think that i must examine more of the logical progression. this entry to me simulates making an entry into my journal. i look at that and realize that everything in their is exactly what you want. the most interesting things that i think about and that lead into other realms our my interactions with other people. today at dinner i saw my ex-girlfriend from high school. she wasn't just a high school crush but the relationship lasted for over a year. after our break up things went down hill to the point that we don't ever talk to each other any more. she sat down with my roommate because she was with a mutual friend of ours. it is odd the way that the alliances from my old group of friends turned out. my roommate and i can see because we have been friends for a long time and we never ran into the point where there was never any conflict between us. one of my other friends who i used to love more than any other person in the world is still a good friend but not quite ion the same level as we were once on(over my girlfriend we separated because he had just broken up weigh her a month earlier. that brings up a question that everyone tries to answer: is friendship or a relationship more important? all three of us were best friends but i bet with my ex that we could go to a higher level and stay there. the question that developed inside was it really a different level or another aspect of the same. i almost lost a lot of my friends for her, but those friends are the only ones still around. i wonder if this philosophy or psych? does it really matter. the problem i think with a lot sciences now days is that the focus is so small that their lack of background in other subjects prevents us as moving as far as we might. how can a man consider himself able to study minds without the back ground of the philosopher. he must have explored his own thought and beliefs enough if is to ever have the hope of trying to understand others. schools inside psych seen contradictory. how can one just study the physiological aspect without considering the developmental. psych in its self probably should not be a major but the aspiration of the one who would devote himself to biology, philosophy, and sociology. the thing that irks about most of psych is that they seem to indoctrinate their own school of thought onto the tablet of their students mind. i believe in an approach that provides the conflicting theories in order to allow the student to make up his own mind. the problems with a lot of classes and student is that they do not teach the children the ability to come up with conclusions for themselves. how is the man who can purely memorize the data of other smart. he is a machine that must have data read in to perform a certain task. those that can create an idea or image to provide those others is the one who deserves praise. he is the man who provides others with everything they receive in life. even in the arts we have gotten to the point where it is simply regurgitating knowledge instead of creating it. those students who take band tell me they have a hard improvising because they were just taught to read the music. the door to true knowledge is creativity and self-examination.

"okay so i'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory hall, realizing that i cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep deleting. it is so hot in here and i hate macintosh comps. i wish i had a laptop in my room. i wish i had money. my roommate brought a computer, and a tv. i feel like the poor one in the room. i actually decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but i just wanted to get away. i just barely got back from houston at about 10 and i need some alone time. what a weekend i had. my friends tiffany, and diana and i went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called emblem281. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very fun group a kids and i was really excited about the audition. i first and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing and flag work i excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says, oh you're going to make it"". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and diana made it and not me. it is because i don't spin rifle and i know the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. i really wanted to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what really hurt the most is the fact that i feel i fail at everything i go for in life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. i tried out for drum major and was told i'd make it no questions asked. i made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told i'd make the all-state band no questions asked. i wanted to be section leader for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game, and didn't make it into emblem. wow. i feel a lot better. it just sucks to be me right now. but i always pull through with god's help. or do i just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. i think i should shower tonite instead of tomorrow morning. i wonder why do we itch. what is the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? i think about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or something. i forget. i must go to sleep soon. i have to get up for dance class at 8. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these groceries so i don't have to worry about walking across campus to eat all the time. i love her so much. even though money is tight, she always makes a way for me. i will never forget the strings we had to pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little assignment makes me feel i should get a journal. i just hope i have done this right. ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!

"i finally got to see matrix: revolutions. i don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful. it's funny, everyone i've talked to that loved the 2nd one hated the 3rd one and everyone that hated the 2nd one loved the 3rd one. i'm in the latter category. i've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now. i think it might have to do with our expectations. i loved the first one. i was waiting for the second one to come out ever since i heard they were making a trilogy. i had good expectations for reloaded, and i went to the theatre to see it on opening night and i was disappointed. the interesting thing is that about a month earlier, x-men 2 came out. i liked the first one a lot, but i wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 2nd one to come out (like how it was with reloaded). my expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent. i hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect. when i went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away. after about an hour and a half had gone by, i checked my friend's watch because i was worried the movie would end soon. enough matrix talk. i just got back from vegas, and i got to see david copperfield. hmmm. it might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an ""illusionist"" and all. i saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that i'm very proficient in visual media. i think it might be because i've seen all of those goddamned behind the scenes ""documentary"" stuff for the extended versions of fellowship of the ring and the two towers. in a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use. maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface. i had a point to this. copperfield. yeah, it was fun. i found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological ""illusions. "" what i mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show. again, it might've been better if i had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks. the older audience members must have been stumped. kenji's very cute. he's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, i don't know. next hour at the most. whenever i'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my cd book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot. instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me. big difference! before i'd moved the computer onto where it is now, i had it closer to the bed on ryan's desk. ken would spend most of his time while i was on the computer on the corner of my bed. er, sorry. amanda's bed. i still can't get over the time when i talked to her (a very rare time since the kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and i took her old apartment) and i was so excited that i'd bought this silky linen for, and i quote, ""my bed. "" ""you mean my bed,"" she said. ""i bought it. you're only keeping the things in that apartment while i'm gone working on the campaign. "" bullshit. when we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, ""oh, i have to go now. i need to go to my mom's bed. or what i should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though i sleep in it every night. "" yeesh! she's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent. i hope she'll get over it, because i really resent the fact that she believes i'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers. for some reason that really bugs me. ken's awake and about now. it's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while i'm typing. my times up anyway, so tah!

"right now i have a flood of emotions coming down on me. maybe i'm just to sensitive. i feel that i close myself up when i'm around my friends. why i do, i do not know. there are some friends of mine that i can just relax and worry about what they think of me. my other friends, i just do not know. it's not just that, but when i am around a group of certain people, i can not open myself to them. the reason why, is that in the past, when i have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. i am very sensitive to things of that matter. i do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when i do not talk to them. i act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. things have changed since junior high and high school, but still i have to watch my back. who knows what they say or think about me. i need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. i think i am a nice person and i am openminded about certain things. i feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then i will be there to listen. whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. i still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. the reason why is that i do not think it is anybody's business. well, i do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. we are not perfect. humans have their little flaws here and there. i will admit to my flaws. there are some that i am embarrassed to admit which means i need to work on them. speaking about working, i need to work out. i worked out only once this week, and i need to work out more. over the summer, i worked out almost everyday. well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. it was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. even so, i still got my three to six times a week that i wanted to get. my clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. still, i have some more work to go. it's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. i have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and i have not been as sick as i was in the past. exercise and a good diet works. it can work miracles, and myself and thousands of people out there are living proofs. i can not afford to get sick right now, especially since school has started. if i was to become sick right now, i would be behind in all of my classes and that would not be fun. that would be bad. let's hope that i do not go down that road.

"i don't really want to do this assignment, i think it's tedious and i want to go to sleep. i haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. i want to study, but i'm totally lost at what i want to do because i have so much work to do. i think i will study psychology first before i study my ee book. i miss my brother, he's so cool. looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. this music in the background is cool, i'm glad i burned the cd today. i hope my dorm mates don't get mad that i'm turning it up so loud. i don't really care that much though. i want to go do something besides work. everyone around here is studying, but i am not. i feel like i'm forgetting to study for something. i wish i went to see that movie last night, it sounded really cool. my neighbors are great, but i don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. i don't understand why i don't trust anyone. i wish i could trust people more, but i think i trust too much already. i don't know. i think i'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. houston seems so far away from here, i miss my family. i don't understand why people don't miss their family here, i seem to be the only one. i try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. i want them to be near me. the houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. the concert i went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. it was strange, off all the concerts i went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. it must be the type of music it is. i wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. but, i hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. i don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. man, my trash can is full, when i'm done i think i'll throw out the trash. why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. i hope that my computer doesn't crash again. it's built well, but i seem to be slacking off on computer studying. i don't know as much as i did or wish to. i love computers so much though. i wish i could be rich like those million or billionaires. but, then again, i don't want to be too greedy, maybe if i could just provide enough for my family. i think i wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what i do. i hope ee is what i like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. i don't think i like writing this. my hands are getting kinda strained. i think i'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, i still have another assignment to do, wow, i'm glad i remembered to do this assignment, i don't want a bad grade only 4 weeks into the school year. okay, i think i want to finish this up. thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, i hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. i think ill stop now. bye.

"right now i am sitting at home checking my email and different things. a lot of things are running through my head. i need to read for my classes, i need to go to work, and i need to clean the house. i am interested in this psychology class and i like dr. pennebaker a lot. he is funny and keeps class interesting. i look forward to class and believe that i will learn a lot. my sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. i am worried about getting everything done and think that i have to much to do. i am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad i don't have class on friday and this weekend on monday. i am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. i am sorry that i will miss the ut football game against stanford but the last one i went to was extremely hot and i was drenched with sweat. i had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. i love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that i attend a university with so much pride and support. i love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. i saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that i couldn't believe it. it is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. i don't need to buy any more ut clothing, etc. i have to much stuff already, but every time i go into the bookstore i buy something with ut on it. i feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and i don't even know if i am doing this right. i am just writing what i am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. i think it has been about twenty minutes so i am going to end the assignment. i enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. it felt like i was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and no one will probably read it anyway.

"okay dokey here we go. just thought i would get this assignment out of the way before i'm overloaded with other stuff. or either put off until the last minute. i hate when i do that. must not do that any more you know you can tell yourself that repeatedly but that doesn't mean that it is going to happen. my past shows oh well. man my stomach hurts just got done eating a salad and now omg pain. why is that these days it seems like my stomach can't handle anything without getting upset gross. oh well listening to a new cd i got this weekend and i'm liking it. the band was really good live too ill just have to go out and see them again sometime. omg this is a lot of writing for only 3 min. i feel bad for the people who are going to read all the students papers. 20minutes of writing never seemed like so much well. now that i'm actually doing it i'm sure that there is going to be a few pages worth. once for another ut experiment i had to do this too and it was hand written for 20min i much better prefer the typing (is that even proper english. note to self again. work on grammar) ohm well at the other ut experiment that i was doing. i was in high school and they put me in the back o f the library (never can spell that word) and told me to write about whatever it is we wanted for 20min. well there i am sitting writing away thinking to myself wow i've been writing for a long time. why haven't they called me up yet. but i never saw the start time. and sadly i ended up writing for 40min. that is a lot especially be hand. these days everyone it seems is so dependent on computers. good at times bad at other. only 14 minutes to go. this has to be by far the most enjoyable assignment i have received so far. i think i enjoy writing it seems to be relaxing. i think i shall start writing in a journal again. although i only seem to write in my journal when i'm angry and htne lock it away until another god awful days comes along. maybe i should start again but this time maybe daily or so. everyone says it is a stress reliever. ha-ha this cd is cute. the lyrics crack me up at times. he is talking about how the bank classifies him as ""poor"" because he doesn't have much money in the bank. and believe me i know how that feels. grrrr i need to get some source of income. seriously. well my stomach is feeling better i wonder what the deal was. omg today after class. since i'm to stub run to wait for the bus i walked up the huge hill to c panking and today for the first time with a back-pack full of books!! omg the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up. i thought i was going to die ha-ha but i guess its a good work out plus the what 50pounds of books hahira damn good work out. man 9 minutes to go. good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because i think i am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world. but and english teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence. hahahaha ironic. he was a great teacher though i really miss his class. he had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes. more mature eyes . ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while . woke the class up. great teacher. i've actually loved all my english teachers in high school although i am horrible at writing and reading. but their classes were challenging and fun. everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me. although now at ut i'm a little scared. i hope i can handle it. i think as long as i can make it past the first year i should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years . right ha-ha. you know what this assignment reminds me of. the new tv show the days. how the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute. didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing. aww poor guy since he was a doc at such a young age. don't you ever wonder if kids like that miss out on their childhoods. i feel bad for them. seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now i know they are going to be exposed to the real world. and they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did. the real world is harsh. man if i could be 13 again i sure would. yet when i was 13 i remember wanting to be 16 and then wanting to be 18. and not that i'm turning 19. ohm depressing. last year to be a teenager. although i never really did all the teenage stuff. it was all to immature for me. but soon i'm going to be 20 and that means. reaching adult. you can't be called a kid anymore. all though i love to call people kid all the time its the greatest. people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary. well 20min up. i bet i look like i have add. prob. do. ha-ha ",0,-0.226036 -0.006945 -0.080135 -0.175271 -0.400392 0.231428 -0.166954 0.32451 -0.338662 1.25744 -0.200978 -0.590446 -0.191505 -0.790837 -0.314344 0.0 -0.04277 -1.432325 -1.215985 -0.474425 -1.410717 0.193496 -0.130569 -0.302175 0.099264 1.236755 0.034108 0.213728 -0.25082 -0.427479 0.082578 -0.9688 0.118767 -0.066507 -0.447171 0.154346 -0.698292 -0.103239 -0.50622 -0.584631 -0.656143 -0.595759 -0.08908 1.025816 0.948677 0.41969 0.549881 -0.41322 -0.37132 -0.207118 0.854847 1.171792 0.439058 -0.679288 0.440572 -0.129307 0.778734 -0.52658 -0.219407 0.200605 0.25731 0.023267 -0.177538 0.080944 -0.27293 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.578541 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.119982 0.673066 0.046932 -0.297284 2.614187 0.496931 -0.214088 4.458342 3.940596 4.563636 4.6656 4.87427,2279
"well, to begin with i am simply thinking that i don't think i can type for 20 minutes without my fingers cramping up. but that is ok i suppose since i doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students, i don't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts. confusion is a funny thing. it comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often. at least i think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often. even when you know exactly what to do, sometimes you can get confused because you don't want to do what you are supposed to. sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. (in a manner of speaking) i am thinking that i am tired of writing about confusion. it's kind of like thinking about thinking. i heard that it is bad for you to do that. i think it destroys brain cells. but then again, a lot of things destroy brain cells. drugs destroy brain cells. i don't do drugs because i don't think i have very many brain cells to spare. wow, only 5 minutes have passed! that is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and i don't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and i am taking no chances with that kind of stuff. i know how sneaky teachers can be. i know how sneaky students can be. some chick was all cheating on out math quiz today. i don't know who she was, but she was just flipping through her notes. the teacher had no clue. he was too busy daydreaming. i could have cheated also, but i don't like to cheat. i think that if my best isn't good enough for the professors at ut, then too bad, i'll go to community college. i would rather have a degree from acc that i earned than one from ut that i cheated my way to getting. i think most people would agree with me but who knows! i tend to think that people are good. but that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once. take for instance my good friend tiffany. yes, good ol' tiffany. i loved her to death. we were really good friends. we did everything together. then one day i found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend, john. that was quite a shock to me. i was so depressed. i didn't even want to get out of bed. i did, but it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do. i was really very in love with him and i thought that he was in love with me too. i guess that is just one example of how stupid i am. so i guess i learned from my experience. people aren't as good as you would want them to be. but then again maybe i didn't learn jack. because the next guy i went out with was a jerk too. well, he actually was a decent guy. at least that is what i said to everyone when they told me he was a ""player"". oh gosh i still have 7 more minutes. well anyways, they told me he was a player but he said that he thought i was the most beautiful person he had ever met, inside and out. that was it, i was hooked. that is all i have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that i was special. he made me feel pretty and he told me i had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person. i loved hearing him say that. i was willing to risk everything. i even compromised my friendship with my roomate. see, she said they were just friends, and so did he, but then when him and i went out for the first time, she was very pist off. i didn't know why, but it became a suspicion of mine that she secretly liked him. i asked her about it, and she denied it. but i still to this day do not know what to think about her liking him. i mean, she did encourage me an unususal amount to break up with him. not that it would do her any good because he really would never go out with her. but still, i wonder sometimes if she ever did like him. she is a strong willed person and i thought that she would just come clean and admit it if she did. but the thing about strong people is that most of the time they are often weak. they are just good actors and can hide it better than the rest of us. i think all humans can have the same amount of strenghth. i think that if you just pretend to be strong, then everyone will think you are strong. it is from this facade that you can draw strenght. take for instance omar. i act like i don't care about him at all when really i still care for him a lot. now, since everyone thinks i am strong i just pretend that i don't care about him and it helps me to deal with it when we are around each other. i guess i kind of slipped the other day when i got drunk and called him on the telephone at 4:00 in the morning. hey, i hope nobody reads this because this is some embarassing stuff and i really don't think that anyone should know about my loser life except for me and the power macintosh. ok well i am pretty much done now. i guess that wasn't so hard after all. i hope the next assignment is this easy. not that my hands aren't going to cramp up when i finally press submit. ok, i'm done.

" i miss my family. they mean a great deal to me and and love them very much. without my best friend, sam, here with me, i wouldn't be here writing this thing. i have never been away from home for more than 10 days and it is something that i know will take some time to get used too. this weekend i will get to see my family and one of my other best friends, ben, and his family. sam and i are going to meat them at lake lbj friday afternoon. wakeboarding, my family and friends, it will be great, i can't wait until friday. ut is a lot harder than the junior college i used to go to, its on whole other level and thats why i'm here. its time for me to go to the next level and do what i do best, create. i have met a lot of really good people over the last 2 weeks, my friend sam introduced me to ruf, its a bible study for college kids, its good me and i like it. sam also introduced me to ultimate frisbee, its totally sweet, i'm thinking of playing intermurals, last year the ruf team won the damn thing. i feel more alone right now than i ever have in my life and i think i'm taking it pretty good. i talk to my family everyday and that helps, but when i walk in my door there isn't anybody there who loves me or who asks me how my day was it hurts. its something that only time can heal. i'm at the age when its time to leave the nest so to speak and i've been ready, then questioned myself, then proved my readiness again. my desire to create and express myself grows everyday, as soon as i gain ascess to a darkroom my work will be some of the best i have ever produced to this date. i have never had these intence feallings and i think they will show in my prints. i also have the desire to write a song, my friend garret, that i met through ruf, and is also one of sams roomates, writes songs and plays the guitar. i know i can't sing and i know i can't play so writting seems to be a good choice for musical expression.

"i finally got into this thing. that took forever. i hate asking questions so it took even longer. i think people are always thinking weird things about me, which i know is bad , but i always do. the good thing is that everyone i've come in contact here has been really helpful. i really cant wait for this weekend. the weeks are so long. i haven't made any new friends here. i have a lot friends that came with me from high school to ut and to other schools in san antonio. i see them every weekend. i'm being really antisocial right now. the thing is that the friends i have are really close to me, and they know everything there is to know about me, and vice versa. i spent the last two years of my life with them, it may not seem like a lot but it was two very important years of my life. i feel really comfortable around them. i m not good at meeting people so i cant imagine being at the same level of friendship with other people especially in college where everyone just does their own thing. so i look forward to every weekend. people around me probably think i'm weird sitting here just typing continuously. i'm sure, actually i'm almost positive there are weirder people here. id really like to finish this already, but i just looked at the clock and i still have time left. i'm going home, back to el paso next friday. its going to be strange. i never expected to go back so soon. i was with this girl for about 5 months before i left, and it was really serious. we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. she was supposed to move here, but she had issues and commitments that were obviously more important. she cane to visit last month for about 3 weeks before school started. we got in a big fight and she left on really bad terms. it was my fault, but i couldn't have her leave on good terms or it would have hurt more. so i acted like a jerk and we fought the last week and a half she was here constantly. anyway i'm really afraid of running into her, because ill be there for a whole weekend and we hang out a t the same places. i think its really funny how a lot of people here think el paso is so small. its as big as austin, and no one knows it. ki heard someone say that they though it only had one high school. it actually has 30-40. oh well it rally doesn't matter, i'm glad i'm here now. i really like it, i cant believe i'm in college and actually grown up and that i actually have real responsibilities. but i very lonely. i miss her so much, and she wants to try the whole long distance relationship thing, but i cant. i really loved her. i've never been so close to anybody in my life, and after everything we shared and as close as we were, it seems like ill never experience that again with anybody. and if i do finally find someone and then we break up i have to go through this whole pain thing again. i know its normal to feel like this, i just moved away from a city i've lived in for 18 years and i just broke up with someone i was prepared to spend the rest of my life with, but its all a little overwhelming. the thing that bothers me the most is that all this takes up too many of my thoughts, and it takes away from what i really should be concentrating on. i really want to do well here at ut, i have a lot to prove to a lot of people. i'm sick of always having this sob story attached to my life. i went to an all boys private school that was small compared to other high school, my graduating class was about 150. everyone knew that i moved out of my house and how i had trouble with my mom, and everyone feel sorry for me, and i'm sick of this whole drama thing, my life is so full of drama. i went over by a few minutes i guess that's all ",0,-0.517405 -0.419508 -0.15922 -0.237716 0.456913 0.72082 0.476295 -0.081424 0.112337 0.303204 -0.136437 -0.590446 -0.667269 -0.262357 -0.509121 0.0 -0.04277 0.390051 -0.090396 0.919293 0.152184 -0.742368 -0.039639 -0.471265 -0.624052 -0.500469 0.430138 0.188345 -0.173221 -0.980335 -0.468561 -1.122421 0.834968 -0.158794 -0.001874 0.240384 -1.383914 -1.301879 -0.101422 -0.951377 -0.017147 -0.649562 1.232509 -0.693828 -0.563581 -0.589948 0.277808 0.465154 0.113314 0.651343 0.688178 0.658238 1.573805 -1.416432 -0.938201 2.276715 0.540391 -0.954251 1.845082 -0.442153 0.993621 -1.329207 -0.480161 -0.377537 -0.181143 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.197881 0.385066 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.144419 -0.422267 -1.434981 -0.451544 3.218859 -0.317363 4.906469 4.273797 4.732216 4.663633 4.593807,152
"don't get me wrong ut is great but there's still something missing: my girl, maria. sometimes life just don't make sense. one minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. man i wish i was still with my girl, or shall i say ex. things are messed up. all cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. the hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. i had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. what's 230 miles got to do with it? too bad she is a year younger or that i'm a year older. things aren't fair in life. speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. he started dialysis today back home in eagle pass. funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. i miss the bastard. it was weird seeing him cry the day that i left. here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. my mom didn't fair much better either. she had the water works going. that was the toughest part of leaving town. i won't miss eagle pass much. just some of the people i left behind, maria included. things change, i went down to watch a eagle pass football game last week. it was against our border rivals del rio. trust me these two towns hate each other. they did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 11. damn i say we like if i played or something. anyways we beat them down last year by 11 in their place too. good old? del rio, always an easy win. austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. all the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. look in class sometime. i sit way in the back in seat 7 front row and there's always seats next to me open. if someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. i don't bite and i do shower. i guess people tend to hang with their kind. my kind doesn't exist here. the hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. they either want to be white or black. i can't go up to them and say something like ?que onda? cause they don't know spanish. its messed up. my spanish is decent but i look like a god compared to some of the hispanics here. oh well i'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. at least we can still ?cag? it together. it's a tex-mex term from eagle pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. i'll tell you more about the origin another day. oh yeah cowboys suck. come on pull it together men! win one for the gipper, do something. the team played horribly in the second half. hope they do better next week on monday night football. man this is crazy. my foot itches, damn athlete's foot. should get something for it. typing late at night is fun. i need to go download the new obie trice album, too bad its only on mirc right now and i can't get it yet. in due time i suppose. i still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. my roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. i'm glad i'm not taking any science course this semester. life is good though. small problems aside i don't have much to complain about other than calculus, but i'll be fine with it.

" i am sitting in my room. there is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. the sound of musics floats in from the next room. paint smells intoxicate me. i feel slightly light headed as i have for the past several days in my apartment. the sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. my mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. i wonder whey she looks so upset about it. the air conditioner begins to run. i have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. i cannot tell if i want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. the phone rings next to me. i don't pick it up because i am worried i have waited too long to finish this assignment and i won't get full credit. i fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. funny how the time just slips away like that. you are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. you wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. my nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. the green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. they look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. it makes my sheets look pretty though. the mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. everything is starting to fade. my mind and eyes start to slow down. everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. i want it to slow down. everything should be slower these days. i like it when it is lazy like on sundays. i watch tv until i feel like eating something. i can smell my mama start to cook dinner. she always makes such good food for me. i smell cheese melting on something. i think it might be broccoli. but you can't smell brocolli. i keep spelling that differently. i wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. how funny. things like that when they happen. like when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. i realized i haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but i have to have it in by five. i think i will try to do it again in a minute. i hope this isn't too bad.

"many why's are predominant. why do i seem to feel unwanted at times? why do i seem to feel betrayed at times. why do i seem to feel like a failure at times? why do i seem to have lost a yearn for optimism? many of these feelings come and go but many do stay implanted in my head. my head is just a constant waterfall. tons of ideas rushing through mixing at a point which creates pandemonium. my head is a maze which produces many blocks such as this wall, why when my mother phones me i become bored all of a sudden? i love her dearly and i know that she must be lonely with all her kids off to college. it is because she misses me and because she loves me. why can't i make that extra effort to make her feel wanted. what can't i give her the same feeling that she makes me feel. emotions run one-sided in her phone calls. i feel a superfluous feeling of want and she must not feel any. corrections can be made to this but i just don't try. how can i think that i am determined to do well in college? how can i feel that i will be persistent and successful in life? if i can feel determined, persistent, and successful in these things, then why is it that i feel determined, persistent, and successful, right before i speak to my mom in order to make her feel wanted and then i fail. is this a preview of what is to come in my future, not only with family relations but also with life experiences. will i continue to think ""i can"" and will i continue to fail? how can i practice my ways to perfect them. how can i execute my feelings and my hopes. how can i make them come true. how many times do i have to continue to tell myself that this is the way its going to be or that that is the way it is going to be and in the back of my mind i know that it will never be the way that i intend it to be. does this mean that i am a failure? what does it mean? should it be something to worry about. will my mother some day get ""fed-up"" with me. can this defect ruin my entire life? is it a defect? why do i think about this stuff? is it just conscious nature? why all these whys i don't know, but what i do know is that there is purpose for everything, and maybe my purpose of life was to wonder why.

" i suppose i should go to the student health center tomorrow to see about this stupid blocked up ear of mine. i walked in there today, but it looked like there was a division for international students or something, and i, as usual, didn't bother to ask around. i'll just give them a call or something to verify before i trek over there next. i wonder if rick checked in at target for that television shelf mom saw. i'd like to go check for it and hang around with him this weekend, but i may be going back to houston. it'll be good to see mom, dad, and anna again. it's great up here, but it's obviously considerably different than it would be staying in the bed i've slept in for eighteen years. it's funny how that sort of thing works. something so simple as a bed or a rug that has always seemed inconsequential can suddenly seem important once it's gone, though i suppose that's the way it goes regarding most things. taking things for granted is much easier for most people. i really wish this bloody ear would unclog itself (bloody being the british exclamation, mind you. i have a tendency to drop into foreign exclamations some times, and i'm sure a writing assignment such as this wouldn't be particularly indicative of the situation surrounding the term. yeesh, i rant quite a lot). i'm sure that last sentence is probably improperly punctuated, but i'm going to let it slide this time. anyway, now i'm coming to the problem i expected would happen. i have nothing of real substance to put into the paper, though in essence that in itself is enough to fuel the writing. this is a stream of consciousness, after all, and noticing that being unable to come up with anything to type is just as fulfilling (and even as clich')as any other topic. huh. i seemed to have remember the alt command to activate the accented 'e'. ahh, the little oddities one remembers from the subconscious. i find it incredibly amusing that i am typing this as though i were talking to someone as opposed to writing my traditionally lengthy essays. english class has taught me well, it would seem. okay, i love this coleman fold out chair and all, but the positioning at my desk is somewhat irritating. it's just a bit too low, so i have to set my ketboard in my lap to type, and the annoyance is exacerbated by the fact that my arms are bent when typing. it's uncomfortable, but not so much that i cannot type. i am going to arbitrarily place another paragraph now. this one has run on for far too long with out a break, irregardless of the fact that it is nothing but constantly flowing ideas. there, much better, even though i momentarily forgot that tab changes the command field in internet explorer. i had to space over to start. oh well, this is better now anyway. it's sort of a strange quirk i have that originated from my junior english class. mrs. eppich managed to ingrain certain formats into me, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. hmm, scalp is itching. i think i want to go to the gym in the basement tonight. i haven't been in awhile, and since my ankle is better now, it will make things much more productive that my last excursion. and my computer just skipped on my nightwish cd. that is annoying, though i supppose it's to be expectedf given the fact that i've got a few programs running. five hundred and twelve megs of memory can only support so many applications. listening to this music is great, though. there are so few metal bands with lead singers worth a shite (yes, there's another term from the british isles i like to incorporate)despite the fact that many of them have very talented instrumentalists. most symphonic metal bands have superb synth and guitar parts, but i have a grudge against bad vocalists. that's why i like tarja so much. i mean, you can't go wrong with an operatic soprano and good instrumentals. hansi k'rsch is also good. never before have i heard a growling voice with as much musicality to it. okay, i took a rather long pause there to serach the character map to find the command for the 'u' with an umlaut. i like to spell things properly, and hansi's last name being german, i figured it deserved to have the proper notation. language is important. it is the tool we use to communicate ideas, therefore i think we should respect it and use it properly lest we forget how to speak to each other in a distinguishable fashion. it is for that reason i dislike dialects of english that butcher it. those dialects are more about the attitude of those who use them than the language. my time is running short, so i'll just type this last sentence until it's out. oh, hey, look at that. it's not strictly a twenty minute paper. well, as much as i wouldn't mind continuing this, i do have some work to do elsewhere. i prefer to direct my writing and creativity towards my novels and stories anyway. i'll finish them one of these days. really, i will. &lt;'excuses&gt; i really ought to just sit down and write them. oh, i suppose not everyone will recognize that command in the brackets up there. it means 'end excuses', basically. it's a habit i picked up in irc, which is an internet relay program. technically, though, it's part of writing html. the backslash is the command that signifies the time to turn a variable off, or something to that effect. i could be wrong. i never really got into html or any other sort of coding. i don't have the patience for it. heh. look at that. i've already continued typing well past the timer. anyway, i suppoe as a final note it should be said that all my 'ahh's and 'heh's and so forth are just onomatopoeia. and now my machine is gritching about ie. bloody stupid microsoft. ahh well, i suppose i'l just submit this now before i get shut off and lose it.

"what's on my mind? right now i am in my friends room, one who i met this year. her names is si nae kim. the thoughts on my mind as i type are, ""mmm. this chocolate is so tasty"". i love chocolate and i choose to eat it as much as i want to until i come to the realization of how fat i am and how much fatter i am going to get if i continue to eat chocolate the way that i do. there's this thing that my friends and i call a train thought and this is when one thought leads to another. the thought about chocolate making me fat leads me to think about my eating habits in college. my mother warned me not to eat unhealthy foods, not to eat late at night, and not to snack during the day. that statement replays in my mind over and over again, every time i pick up something to eat. yikes! well, now i'm just thinking about how i can lose all this weight. should i go work out, jog, do aerobics, or should i just read my books. i am just so lazy that i can't ever seem to go workout. on tuesdays and thursdays i only have one class from 3:30 to 5pm. i spend the rest of the day either sleeping or attempting to do my homework. these activities don't take up my entire day and i do have time to workout. however, i am just too lazy. now the thought of how tired i am has just hit me. all day i have been reading, trying to catch up on my assignments that i have fallen behind on. my eyes are puffy and i can feel them starting to close on me. my body is giving out on me too. trying to right this paper, which i almost forgot about, is taking a lot of energy from me at this point. it's interesting to see exactly what's coming out of my mind so freely. i can't wait to read this after i'm completely done. hmm. i wonder if this paper is actually going to be graded in any academic point of view. i wonder how hard the test is going to be. i wonder if i really have to read all the chapters or if i can just rely on mr. pennebaker's lectures. i hope i don't fail psychology class. i hope that i pass with an a. wow, i feel like i'm just babbling now. will this paper get too long? my mind seems so boring up there. the things that are coming out on paper right now are so boring and useless, but this is what i was told to do. i'm trying really hard to type without stopping but it's hard. well, i have about five minutes left. what else is on my mind? should i go to my biology discussion class tomorrow? we didn't really do much the last time and it isn't mandatory. oh well. i wonder how my family is doing in houston. i wonder if my sister misses me. actually, i know that she misses me because she told me so. i wonder if i'm going to meet any one cute anytime soon. i wish i had a boyfriend, but then again, it is kind of fun being single. then i don't have to worry about being held down. this is college, a whole new world of opportunities to meet new people, to discover myself. wow, i'm so overwhelmed at the thought. i don't know if i am completely used to the whole college idea yet. oh my goodness, i met my exboyfriend today. what a small world. i thought that i would never see him again. oh, you probably don't want to hear about that stuff though. i wonder how my best friends are doing back at home. i miss them a lot. i feel like i left everything behind. i feel like i'm away at camp or a long retreat. i feel like that life almost never existed, that the whole thing was just a fantasy. i feel like i've been living here, in austin, for a really long time. wow, my thoughts are really random and still boring. what a boring life i lead. argh! i kind of want to go partying, but i'm afraid that i'll get addicted and then i'll eventually fail out of college. what a bright future. yeah right! i love dancing, i really regret not taking it in high school, but hopefully i won't make that same mistake again in college. college, where the doors open up to new adventures. this is the real deal, this is pretty much when everything counts. it's going to lead me to my future. well, my time is up now so ta ta!

"i don't really know what i want to write about. i am about to start watching football. i used to like pro football a lot more, but now i really just don't care. i would much rather watch college that pro. i am downloading some music right now. i am ready for this paper to be done so that i can go and watch some football. i hope that this class isn't too hard. i don't want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major. when i was walking to class today i was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier. but it will be ok, i'm just going to have to study. the other reason that i don't like that class is that i don't know anyone so everyday i come in a couple minutes before class starts and i sit down. and the only talking that i do is small-talk with someone that i don't know. that gets old after awhile, saying the same thing over and over again. it's always what classes are you in and how's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing. it just gets really old. 20 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock. i am ready for the weekend to start. football weekends are the best. this weekends tailgate is going to be a blast. there are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling. this is getting old, because i'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and i am about to fight him. he keeps on laughing at me and i don't like it. here's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder. he is not as much of a prick as the other one. i don't want to fight him right now. he just walked out of the room. my other suitemate hasn't walked in yet. he probably won't. he is pretty weird. he sits in his room and plays video games most of the day. other than that he just spaces out and watched tv. he doesn't party either. i feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff. i think he knows one person up here. but they don't really go out and that is no fun because i know that he is not having a good time up here. but maybe this is just the normal thing for him. he doesn't seem like he was a real social person in high school. i only have 4 minutes of typing left here so then i will be done and be happy. i'm listening to some new austin music right now. this paper is almost done, so i am happy. my friend just told me that his dad drinks o'douls, that would not be fun. my dad drinks real beer. now my paper is done.

oh, no you time it for me. wow 20 minutes is a long time. i don't even look at the screen when i type. just the keybopard. my hands are tired. my favorite channel is tlc. it's great. right now a story about conjoined twins are on. my boyfriends is back in plano. my thoughts jump around faster than i can type i don't have any thoughts anymore ihad to turn off the tv all i could do was listen to it maybe that is why i ran out of thoughts maybe that is why people say tv frys (or is it fries?) your brains i don't think tv makes you studpi there are plenty of educational shows my sister learned to read through sesame sttreet, i don't miss my parents much is that bad? it was kind of annoying living at home with them my phone is rinignfg am i allowed to get that i guess i can call them back in like 15 minutes i think it is the guy i met from they gym who was calling. college doesn't feel like its satarted. it still feels like summer fore me. i only have class every other day so its kind of hard getting into tht study mode. am i writing too much. am i suppose to just write a few thoughts as i have them or cointinuously type. i hope its continuosouyl type cause that is what i am doing. do ya'll actually read this? i wouldn't really want my real stream of consciencce read. ithink thoughts and emotions are very personal and should only be expressed or shown in needed situations or with a person you trust. what if my real stream of conscience was that i wished somebody would blow up ut ( which it's not i promise). ya'll would redflag me and secretly watch me, so i don't really like doing this assignment. i don't mind it actually. it's pretty simple and something interesting to do, i guess a way to learn about yourself. i don't like writing much. i use to keep a journal but i was too lazy to write in it all the time. usually when i wrote in it it was when i was pissed off, so everytime i went back and read it it seemed like i was a really angry person all the time. i wantred the journal to be like a memory book. but, if i was feeling any strong emoitons ii didn't feel like writing in it. i guess i probably talked on the phone. my cell phone gets horrible reception here. it is hard to talk to my boyfriend back in plano cause he always breaks up. he's not really my boyfriend anymore, but he really is. i don't think that makes sense. ten more minutes. so. my nails are shiny i'm tired of doing this. i don't get why we are doing this either. if mine is this long and there about 300 people in each class and say there are about 5 classes, that's 1,5000 papers. nobody probably reads this. it is probably random spot reading if anything so this will get submitted and overlooked so i don't really see a point in this i wonder if everybody has around the same stream of conscience. i bet a lot of people are writing about how they have to do this assignment and they don't see a point to it really. i don't know what i want to be when i grow up. i wanto to make a lot of money. i was gooing to do psychology but everybody is doing it. 1 out of 3 people i ask are a psychology major. it is very interesting and i loved it in highschool, but future wise there's not much you can do with it as i see it. there is a teacher or a psychologist or maybe a social worker. and if 1 out of 3 people are doing it at ut and there is about 50,000 people, wells that's about 17,000 pyschologists and teachers alone from ut, there is still to mention tech, and other schools where most people are doing psychology too. i think everyopne should take psychology though. but i think way too many people are majoring in it. actually, i think majoring in it fine so that way you can get an extensive look at how human nature and the mind functions, but i think that knowledge should be applied to other fields. so everyone should study pyschology, but not pursue a field in it. i really want to be a person who does case studies on dreams. i think dreams are so interesting. i had a dream about roseanne the show and that i met the cast. it's really weird. i remebr thinking i should get their autographs so i can put it up on my wall. sometimes, though, i think people see too much into dreams. i think people on drugs have deep dreams, or maybe they are having reaaly fake dreams. like their brain is just so confused it is just sending randome imaages. i don't now. i think drugs let ypou tap into another side of your brain. i think they can open your mind. i think drugs like x can open your mind, but i think that you should learn how to open your mind without drugs. i think no one should do drugs on a regular basis. i wonder if a lot of philosophy and psychology teachers have done drugs. i personally think they have one time or another, and if they haven't i wonder what their thoughts and reactions would be like to drugs. oprah did a show about x users, i only saw part of it. some of them said that it opened their eyes and that if they were doing their work and had a mental block, the drug would help their thoughts flow. oprah was still like that's very bad . i guess it is bad, they should learn to let their mind flows without drugs. it's sad if the only was you can open your mind is thru drugs.

"people laugh at the same things over and over. there doesn't seem to be any diminishing of reward. no matter how long a joke has been around, no matter how old the recipient is; the same things seem to make people laugh. why is that? maybe it's because we like hearing the same stories over and over, associating them with our memories. like ""star wars"". nobody today looks at star wars and says, ""man, check out those models! no strings? how did they do that?"" or, ""man, that hark hamill is a great actor!"" but most of us can remember a time when we would have said that, so we just watch it over and over and over again. nobody would do that with ""schindler's list"". and the fact that schindler is now in star wars just mucks it all up. that's why everyone thinks episode one sucks they're beyond the point where they want to see any more of that. the fact is that they're all fairly crappy, especially return of the jedi. good god, was that awful! but people go back and say it was the best, because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids. come on, ""care bears"" was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves. why did we ever like that in the first place? well, it was the 80's nothing else was on. how did the end of the 80's manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? suddenly, everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science, or at least enough to talk about them, which was not at all. you barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something. i've seen ""very intelligent"" high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues. they bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument, like the bible. what the heck does isaih have to do with campaign finance reform? all the people in the bible lived under a sovereign government they didn't even have elections! there weren't even ideas at the time to compare to these, because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the roman government, and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government. since most of them got ripped off by being murdered, it's not like they can very well put forth a campaign. the romans had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didn't like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of 35. might as well have been anarchy, but then again, you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart. of course, we know how well that strategy worked, considering the glory of the current roman empire.

"okay here i am after i've been spending tons of time trying to get a book i need. i'm not worried about it anymore. i will focus on my other homework. i need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. maybe i won't eat lunch. tonight i have a party to go to and i am excited. i need to tell my friend what time we will leave. where will i park? maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. the radio is on and i'm listening to country music. it's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. i am going home tomorrow. i can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. i will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. sleep is a priority as well. oh, and i'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. wow, i forgot about the chance that i will get a home cooked meal. i need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. i'll come home monday evening. i need to wash my car while i'm there. i hope my roommate is occupied enough while i'm gone. she can come home with me another time. i hear people in the hall all the time. it's amazing how many are up as early as i for an 8 am class. no one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. my eyes burn because i'm so tired. i took an hour nap yesterday, but i don't have time today. i can't get my ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--i'm very frustrated. very chapped! i am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things i need to do. i know though that i can get it done, just one thing at a time. plus, i am doing one of those things right now. i wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. i'm an hour away, not bad. i hear this song ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" and it reminds me of eddie murphy on the old saturday night live. he did buckwheat impersonations. i have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. i hope this doesn't sound like a letter. i am beginning every sentence with ""i"" but that's okay because i am supposed to notice how ""my"" thoughts flow. i wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. i just wish i could get my ethernet hooked up. i like america online, but it's tying up my phone line. that is also making my anxious right now. i guess the faster you type the longer the paper. i wonder what the other students doing this have to say. i wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. i hope i get some mail soon. i check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. i know people are writing'sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. that's my optimistic side. i hate the cold floor under my desk. i'm in jester, but i have carpet that i brought to go between the beds. i'm thinking of my friend in alaska that will come at christmas time. will we have time for me to show the good stuff about texas? my throat tightens to think of it. i stress easily. i feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that texas is the coolest place to be. it won't be as pretty in december though. great, i have about 5 more minutes. my hands are slipping off this tiny space. i have no room on my desk. i want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. it would be so ideal. i am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. i feel like i'll lose the urge to do my math homework if i sit here any longer. oh, i can't wait until the party. matchbox 20 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! i need to remember to take my camera. i also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. all of this by 4 pm--i believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. i wish i could go to sleep. i hate it when i can't focus because i'm so tired. i value sleep more than money it seems. if that makes any sense. i am ready to go now, i feel the pressure of having too many things to do. i will take care of my math homework first. then biology and art history. psychology is halfway done now, but i need to get the book. no one has it. that is also causing a little aggravation. i hate to not be fully prepared for everything. okay, my 20 minutes are up, i feel better having done this.

"now the computer is making noise. i wonder why it does that. i have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. i guess that is what it is doing but i am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is quentin and i am in psychology 301 with pennebaker. so far i have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. i am not for sure if it is because i find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and ' or interesting in his way of presenting the material. either way i enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. i am starving too. i wonder what we are having at the phi gam house for lunch today. it better be good. i am starving. i have had a bad headache all day too. i hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because i haven't eaten lunch yet. i t will probably go away when i8 eat. it usually does. tonight i have a lot of homework to do. chemistry is keeping me very busy. i had no idea that chem204 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. i wonder if i will play catch with scott again today. it will probably be good for me if i do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. i wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. i wonder of pres. clinton is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with monica lewinsky like he did. that was really stupid of him. i can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. i bet hillary is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what i saw. that sucked that i had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. i wonder how long aikman will be at he is supposed to be out for 4 to 8 weeks. i think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. i never knew he went to ucla until this weekend when they said it during the horns v. ucla game. i wish we would have won that game, but i really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. i hope that is caries over to the kansas st. game. if we would win that game it would be so large. i wonder if we are still going to be in the top 25 pole after this weekend. i hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. ricky did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. i wonder if all of my friends had fun in cali. while they were there for the game. i hope i get to go to cali. for some reason in the near future. i have never gotten to go there before. i think i get to go this summer with jenny and her family if they still go. that would be fun. mom and dad head for england in about 2 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. i wish i could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, i want to go on a cruise sometime too. i think that would be the most fun. i can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. i have seen pictures but that is all. i hope i can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows.

" i havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like i could write for a very long time. i do that though, i have a journal and its handy. i like to go back and read what i write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and i hope more people use journaling to express themselves. some people use online journals which at first i thought was odd because i write personal stuff in my journal. i wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then i started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. that reminds me of george, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. george makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. i am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and i swear he has pms. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and i didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. i don't know if i belive him but i really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. he is such a confusing boy. i mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, i knew what i was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now i feel bad like i'm just judging everyone i know. grr. that's a noise i make, i make many of them. i make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because i can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. i just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. i wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because i was of the opinion that i was getting an apartment so i wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man i was wrong. i visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while i was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions i'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now i miss them a lot. i was listening to avril lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home. and i realized that i have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out my cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. i like to claim that at least i'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like i tend to do. i took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said i was an estp? i think. anyway, part of it said that i would tell people what i think. i don't know how correct that is because i am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much all my friends will say crap. jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together i was quite angry. and still when i think about it i get angry at her. why not at him? i don't get that. but when i typed his name i accidentally wrote sew. i am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because i keep thinking of things. like today as i walked across campus i was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. i've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but i just. didn't. and now, even though i'm busy with papers to write etc, i really want to get creative. lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. i can't remember how badly it ran but i should probably check that before i buy one. i don't know how much they'll cost either. i think $150 at walmart? but i don't want a plastic one. i'm sure i could break it and i'd rather have machinery than plastic. i think i should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but i said that once and she said no way. whatev. i'm tired. i tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 i think. i don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks. and i've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that i hate my job. and this isn't like the first year i worked at culvers and i was just a lazy bum. i am good at my job, i do it well, i used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has been really hard to make myself go. and its not like i'm just going to call in sick, i just don't want to go. i want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. i don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, i know i'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago.

" right now i am in my dorm room recovering from classes and preparing for an evening filled mostly with studying. my ears are receiving the wonderful sounds of jack johnson, jackopierce & dave matthews, and also ceili rain ( a camp allen classic). i can not say that i am smelling anything particularly because my sinuses are acting up after a game of soccer last night. i guess there is just something about the grass down by the lbj fountains that fires up my histamines. i am feeling a little anxious and stressed right now. i woke up at 10:00 this morning just as my first class was starting. this class is small and very much attendance based, so i could not simply skip it. i had to rush out the door and i believe that this rush has caused me to feel as though in race all day. the stress comes from the inability to finish a project for that class as a result of my oversleeping. i know the professor was not proud and i am afraid my grade will suffer as a result. i want to keep my grades up so that i will be able to easily transfer to any school because right now i do not believe that i will be able to cut it for 5 years in architecture school. for now i am committed to finishing this semester and evaluating things from there. my mind just wandered back to psychology class today. dr. pennebaker really angered me when he suggested that one of the greatest christians of all time and that spirituality and religion are all frauds and conjured up by our temporal lobes. he said that paul saw a vision of christ after he fell on the road to damascus because he probably hit or damaged his temporal lobe. well paul saw a blinding light that caused him to fall and afterward he was blind, which would not be caused by damage to the temporal lobe. furthermore, other people had received visions of what was to happen and to receive paul into their homes as a result of the events. there i've said my piece. i just realized that the music i'm listening to makes me miss my friends. one is called please come to boston and it talks about trying get together with old friends as this person is moving on with their own life. it has the same effect on me. i want my friends to come visit me on campus, but for some reason it would feel like a step back for me to go visit them. the other song is one from the christian summer camp i worked at for the past three summers. it just takes me back there with all of my friends and the summer love. we still talk occasionally, but only over the internet and not on the phone. i really prefer talking face to face if at all possible and then the phone and lastly the internet. it just seems so impersonal to talk on the internet with instant messages. plus you can not fully express yourself; sarcasm for example is hard to decipher when written. wow, i actually wrote for twenty minutes and enjoyed it. this was actually a little therapeutic to express myself like this.

" well. i just finished my first week of college. i can't believe i'm already here, but i wish i was already out. there seems like so much to do but i'm starting to get things under control. i think. my friend helen is at a&m and shes going to jump for the track team. she is an emblem of success. everytime i think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person i am. i guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when i make them, because i know better. hopefully i can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when i'm forced to do it. tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the si class, but that's okay i think i'm going to need as much help as i can get. tonite's church. thank the lord. sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. i love church, but sometimes i feel so . . i don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. i know that's not true. only i lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and i wanted to scream out. i've been caught in that trap beofre. which i have and thank the lord i no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of god did i get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. oh. el patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because i have to right a paper on it and i need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! i can't wait to be home tonite. i've been up at school since before 7 am. only to realize that my 8 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 12 noon. oh well at least i got some studying in and i was able to finish my english homework so that i wouldn't have any tonite. praise the lord. anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man i hope he gets his own phone soon. i miss him. i wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but i don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course i understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. i don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like i know what's right but i wish things could be different. i don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to san antonio and pick up stephen (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh lord please help me to find favor with him on this situation. wow. twenty minutes is a lot longer than i thought it was going to be. it's like writing in my journal on the computer. what dr. pennebaker said today about when your depressed, to write what your feeling down. i totally agree. i know no matter what i'm feeling it always helps to write in my journal and shed a few tears of course! i like journals soo much that lately, i've been giving them to my friends for their birthdays. my time is clicking down. i really hope i can find a job soon and hopefully my friend lauren found one today.

"it is really hot in here. i wish someone would turn the ac down. i hope i didn't miss anything in calculus today, but i can get the notes from nicole. i need to do so much stuff this week with little time to do it in. i need to email david and reply to all of the emails i got yesterday. i need to hang up my pictures in my room, but don't have anything to hang them with. i still haven't cashed the check from mom, and i'm running low on money. college is sooooo expensive and there's always too much to do. i hardly have time to do everything that i need to do. i have to pay for all of the clubs i want to join and speaking of that, i have to write essays and fill out applications for tx sweethearts, spirits, the children's hospital, and go to a meeting for aed. i have a meeting at the adpi house tonight and wed night!!!! all these meetings--at least one everyday'night. i also have so much chemistry homework tonight. i keep falling behind in all of my classes. as soon as i catch up in one of them, i fall behind in another. but last night i did a lot of homework, so that helped a little. you know, everytime i am trying to write a thought, twenty more come into my mind. i wonder who looks at these writings and if they get bored of hearing everyone's thoughts. i have to do seven minute abs tonight because my roommate and i are going to for two weeks to see if we can get a six pack. my fingers are starting to tingle from typing so much, so fast. i wonder what's for dinner tonight at the sorority house. i hope it's something healthy. i haven't been eating very healthy since i left home. not that i ate healthy before but at least i had complete meals, not just pizza or junk food. what else am i thinking of?. maybe if i look around my room. i really need to clean my crap off the floor and desperately need to do laundry. i normally go home to do it but i do not have time to go all the way home and waste time there, waiting for it to dry like last time. although i did promise my brother that i'd bring him up to my dorm to check it out since he hasn't seen it yet. and i really want to see my dogs. i think i miss bear more than anyone else. probably because i cannot talk to him over the phone or email him like i can my parents. russ calls me nonstop and really gets on my nerves. i feel bad when i'm mean to him but i have so much stuff to do and don't really have time to talk about nothing to him. uh, oh, my sweetmate just got home from yesterday. she stays at her boyfriend's house almost every night. gretchen told me that she came in at 7am this morning making tons of noise. she doesn't care about other people and is so self-centered. i hope she doesn't come in here and read this. that'd be very bad. i need to go to tops to get my pictures from last friday night. i had so much fun and want something to remember the night by.

"right now i am thinking about this writing assignment. i am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort i will have to put into it. it appears to be low effort on both fronts. i have two conflicting thoughts now. on one side the easies gives me more time to relax. it is night now and i am not really in the relaxing mood. i want to go out and do something but somehow i am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than i was living with my parents. my expectations of independence have not been meet yet. i am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that. i tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out. speaking of throwing things out, the trash is damn full. this assignment is already starting to bore me and i just started it. i wish i didn't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that i could dedicate my time to. i find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging. when things aren't challenging, i must event a challenging task or at least a large one. physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed. now i workout for relaxation and for selfimage. naturally i am shy. this bothers me because being shy involves things that don't make sense to me. i really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if i don't remind myself of these things talking to someone isn't a natural reaction. i am pronature in many respects. i am against the taking of medicine to the point won't take aspirin. i am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods. i am surprised i haven't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing i am more surprised at is that i have had none. and now that i think about it i haven't had any for a long time. i used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it didn't matter any more. i got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed. i was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed i haven't. i don't let anything affect me anymore. i have been away from my mom, dad, brother, sister, and dog and i don't really miss them. talking about the past too long also bores me. i like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement. it gives me excitement because i look forward to bigger and better things. right now i can't define things. things used to be money, wife, good friends, and children. i dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear. bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind. i have had a spiritual awakening. i not religious, in the sense i don't go to church. but i try to communicate with god in more subtle ways. i have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen, something good will happen. i never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe. the first night i was here i left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when i came back it had been found and returned to me. i left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me. when i came back for it, it was gone. i emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and i was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars. luck is one of those things i don't have. i would never rely on chance more than i had too. it was not luck my book was returned. i am glad i am at ut or for that case away from home. my mom is very pessimistic and impatient. these thing irritate me to the point where i like avoiding her. a categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in god but they don't truly. they are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me. i have a friend who is always lying. i think he does it to make people envy him. but i don't think he realizes i don't envy people i just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them. my mind is at a blank now. i am only thinking about the humming of the computer. time is up.

"why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and i to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 4 years, and all of a sudden i have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, i don't think so. i mean, it is a nice gesture, i guess. i would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, i hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. i eamn, i did come here to expand my horizons. i do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. so, i decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. why? it isn't like i am enjoying this. i would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. i really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. but, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and i love that. even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. she is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, i could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. it was almost as though i could read her mind. my foot itches. tomroow, i am going to church for the first time in about 6 months. i don't know why i stopped going, maybe i got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. i am not really sure, but i am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because i definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. no, that is not the right word, i am not lonely, maybe just scared of what i am to become being spiritually dark. why did that happen? i don't understand so many things, but i am trying. i have also been going with holly, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. i really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. i miss my mom. i hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. he is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. he isn't very attentive, but very creative. i miss my family, we were very close. except for my dad, he is a jerk. i wonder sometimes if i will ever find it important to speak to him again. i don't really think so. he does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. he doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every bad move, without noticing the good ones. i am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but i am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. maybe it will come in time. i hope that i am not studying the wrong things for class. i often wonder how i am going to make the grades. i mean, i know i can, i am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. especially coming to college for the first time. i never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. once again, i am so glad to have holly here to keep me in my comfort zone. it is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but i am struggling with all of these new people. i have not found the time to really get to know anyone that is new yet. it is like they are all aquaintences. i am sure that that will all change, once i am in the swing of things and i do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. why are we doing this assignment? am i part of some sort of research? i would like to know, i feel like i am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. maybe i am just another research rat. why do they always do research on rats? i don't get it? if you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? i mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. but i do not like that animal research idea at all. give it up. we are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. we should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. why should we impose onto other species? what if it was the other way around? wouldn't we think. ""why do they even care? it isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?"" people are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. it almost ruins the whole experience of life on earth. or mars for that matter. do we care if there is life on mars? unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? technology is killing man, man is killing himself. life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y2k crap. oh well, i don't understand. why am i thinking all of this at one time? pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as i am typing, but i suppose i am thinking it for a reason. i got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. why? i asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. i mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. i think i deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, i am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. i miss the punk rock scene in houston. i am sure i just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. i found a club that i am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. i am extremely excited about that. i wonder if i am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. i wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. then, all of the thoughts will explode and i will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? i definately think so. well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. i want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. i can type extremely fast for some weird reason. i am done. enjoy me *cara* ",1,-0.066925 -0.577445 -0.425932 -0.678878 -0.3035 0.485753 0.186194 0.22555 -0.007723 2.241969 -0.189535 2.334508 -1.265634 0.672266 -0.372936 0.0 -0.04277 0.406241 -0.342478 1.372418 0.008241 -0.370688 0.231209 0.73896 -0.04952 -0.971619 -0.031228 -0.357048 0.614746 0.198419 0.402985 -0.146248 0.782594 -0.016915 0.493306 0.697406 0.665484 1.006291 0.83518 0.297291 -0.430951 1.245157 1.727815 -0.162206 -0.22743 0.016044 0.04868 0.560236 -0.209308 0.485313 0.671004 -0.966261 -0.307189 0.495975 -0.339961 -0.234471 -0.538791 -0.954251 -0.421635 0.817304 -0.660064 -0.471844 0.721713 -0.088991 -0.329271 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.114728 1.56544 -0.073676 -0.23436 2.636327 -0.37208 -0.222461 -0.049581 -0.961253 -0.451544 -0.121011 0.423717 4.930489 4.380411 4.68305 4.795752 5.032687,1009
"okay, i just started writing or well i guess typing. i am still kind of emotionless because i just woke up. you know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. i'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. i am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. i have a pretty good feeling because i got to this page alot easier than i thought i would. right now the only thing i really think about is a situation i am in. i am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and i don't really know. the big problem is that this guy i dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the army) to kaline which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if i am seeing anyone new. i don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that i am waiting for him. knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone i happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. this is something i normally would not mind doing, but i really like this guy i am dating so i don't know what to do. my bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. i probably need to have that checked out. i am having to shift positions right now because i am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. now my nose itches so i have to rub it. my room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until i have the chance to take them home. my hands are starting to shake a little so i must be getting hungry. my roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. i kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. you can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. i really miss my cat, black jack, i have had her since i was two and she is beautiful!!! i think my twenty minutes are about up and i am really hungry, so i'm going to end this. bye!!

"hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. i have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because i have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. i have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. i am also scared that by tomorrow i will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. i have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so i guess i should go. i kind of miss my room at home. it is hard to have to share a room with someone. this is the first time i have never had a room all to myself. sometimes i wish the room was just mine but i am ok with it because i know it is good to have a room mate. christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. i really need to work out but i cannot because of this sinus infection that i have. when i run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. how that works, i don't know. i was thinking about it. how can sinus fluid hurt your face. i could ask the doctor, but i am too lazy to listen to the answer so i won't. hmmm. whatever is on my mind. i really have a lot of studying to do. it is 10:00 in the morning and i woke up just to study. getting this done though makes me feel as if i have gotten something accomplished. i like that feeling of accomplishment. everytime you do something you get a check. chapter 1: check, chapter 2: check. the check feels really good. i don't know why it feels so good but it does. i am kind of concerned right now about the time. this clock on the computer is really off but i am using it anyway. i just have to time 20 minutes right? i have ten minutes left. i have rally never known how to spell the word minute. i don't even know if that is right. for all i know that could be the for minute(as in small) i even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless i was talking about music, it wasn't. so for now i just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though i just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling i typed it wrong. i am actually a good speller, i promise. i just get confused sometimes. this it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. i guess i will type about something interesting. hmmmm lets see. i really want matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. the one where is records every five minutes. (see there that word is ageing) i really would like to know what is going on in my life. so far this is what i think is going on but i am not really sure. i am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. i need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. i am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: i stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. i don't have a football ticket. i think i might go to fort worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. he is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. i thought i might cheer him up. it makes my grandma up set so i though she could use some cheering up too. and this is why i need to take the recording test. because i hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that i do not realize. it has been 20 minutes- good bye.

"this song is really sweet my computer is slow but it's cool it's doing pretty well for me i should start typing next to each other just in case i run out of room. well that's better. hehe. i don't believe monica did that. actually i'm not sure if i can write that type of stuff on here. it's kind of personal and what if someone reads this. i don't mind if pennebaker or matt reads it. but what if it's someone else. never mind about that. start thinking and type what your thinking wenshi. great now i'm talking to myself. that's funny. well. the songs over. what's next. prem is a really sweet guy and i am very lucky to have him. i'm also very lucky to have friends like amy, phong, thang,julie, janet, sean, and so many more. and especially lucky to have such a mom and dad and three brothers that really care. they take care of me. they do lots for me. wenjen upgraded this computer that i'm using to type. isn't he so nice. what a brother. it's really cold in our room. i feel like i'm talking to someone. and tell them everything about myself. but i don't think that is what stream of consciousness is. i don't know. well i'll just keep typing until time is up. oh yeah. i need to call janice and ask her if she has an extra cable for our tv in the room. good thing i wrote sentences right next to each other. this assignment would of been really long if i didn't. i know i don't have to worry about spelling and grammar and all but it kind of bothers me. it's not much the grammar and punctuation but spelling and spacing of words. i guess i'm just anal or something. who knows. i think other people like my friends and family know me better than i know myself. geez that shouldn't like that but i think that's how it is. oh well. hmm. what else should i think about. that's weird i'm thinking about what i'm thinking. hehe confusing. i miss my friends from high school that aren't going to ut. i miss my family too. my hometown isn't that far away compared to others but i still miss my friends and family. wow i don't know how others from out of state or even the country do it. it must be hard for them. i'm worried about mommy she's home all by herself. everyone is at a different place. wow. but in october all of us should be together. i can't wait until that day comes. it's going to be so cool. it hasn't been like that for more than a year. my goodness only 13 minutes have passed. i have written a lot in 13 minutes. geez. and 7 more at least. wow. i wish all papers in all my classes would be this easy. i mean it's not easy but easier than other writing assignments. you don't have to worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and just about everything else. just need something on paper. what kind of paper is that. i think i'm in paper heaven. hehe. that's like the coolest thing. i wish other teachers would be so generous. what happened to my music. i didn't pick this to be in my file or play list editor to play music continuously. but it's still a good song. i didn't even know it was in the file. that's pretty cool. actually kind of weird. hmm. i wonder how long it's been now. my hands are kind of getting tired and hard and tense from typing all this continuously. it's actually tough to type so much because you are thinking of so much at a time. it would be easier if i could type faster or my thinking would be less. hehe. that's never going to happen. i have been told i think a lot. and my mommy says i have lots of wrinkles under my feet. she says that means you keep everything to yourself. it's true for me. i don't know about others though. i think that's a cool but weird saying or superstition whatever you want to call it. it is funny too. well. what time is it now. let me look real quick. i started when the time said 1:10 and now when i looked it's 1:29. just one minute away from the minimum time. i'll type a little longer so it's not like i stopped right at 20. well the music stopped. you know what i just realized. i did pick all those songs i thought i didn't pick. that's funny. oh well. well. the playlist is out of songs i have to start it again when i'm done typing which should be ok to be now but let me check just in case the minute isn't over. i don't want to cheat and make it 19. 5 minutes. let me see here. it's 1:32. so i've been typing for 22 straight minutes. wow. my right arm is sore. it really hurts. i guess i should stop now. well nice typing for my first writing assignment in psychology. i'll be writing another one soon for the second writing assignment. well see this page later. hehe.

"as i sit here, i wonder what i got myself into. i came from a school of 300 people. i graduated with a senior class of 76. the university is such a huge place, i wonder if i'm going to fit in, or should i say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. it's not that i don't like my classes that i have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but i wonder what the future holds. my birthday is today, and i am finally 18. it seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. but now that i finally made it, it's no different. my mom called this morning to wish me a happy birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. her little baby girl is now 18. she asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. my grandparents also called this morning. they live across the street from my old house, and i was continuously over there visiting them. she told me that she still thinks that i'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. she says it's like i'm gone for the weekend, but i'll return soon. and my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. every time i look at him, i see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. raising 8 kids is no easy job. the day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. i was going to read for the mass. i went up to the podium and i looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. i was so proud to be a part of that. i was thankful that god allowed me to be there and have that feeling. and now when i talk to him on the phone, i get that feeling all over again. i miss him dearly. sometimes i think more than i miss my mom or my brother. now, my step dad, i don't miss him at all. sometimes i look back, and i don't know how i put up with him so long. he is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. he married my mom when i was 6 years old. i didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. he was just a total control freak. nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. from getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and i had gotten into a name calling fight. he's a dick, that's all there is to it. i never brought friends over to spend the night; i never wanted any guys to come over to see me. my escape place was at my grandparent's house. i would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. all he would tell me was that i could come up there and live with him any time i wanted to. on weekends i was hardly home, i was usually spending the night at holly's house, she is my best friend. now that i'm at college, i don't have to put up with him anymore. i don't plan on coming home anytime soon. my mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. talking about what comes to mind is difficult. i feel that i have burdened you with all of my family problems. don't feel sorry for me, i don't. life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes.

"i am writing in the flawn library. this is my first time using the computers here at the university. i was a little afraid because i did not have my e-mail address yet. but now i do and i am feeling a little better. i still do not know how to e-mail someone yet, but hopefully i will learn. the only people i would e-mail to would be my dad or some assignment i have to do for rtf 305. i am not very good with computers. that is one of my weaknesses. i feel a little out of place here in the computer room because i feel that i am the only person that does not know how to use computers. i guess i will keep asking questions until i finally figure it out. i wish i learned how to use computers earlier in my life, then maybe i would not be at such a disadvantage. computers could come in real handy. like for this writing assignment, for instance. in rtf 305, we have to go to the web page and ask questions in a discussion between fellow students. that sounds like a good idea. i am feeling tired today. i got enough sleep last night. i do know what my problem is. it was hard staying awake in class today. hopefully tomorrow will be different. before i came to the library, i was supposed to go to a si for rtf. the only problem was that i went to the cma building instead of the cba building. that upset me because i was really looking forward to going. there is one tomorrow, but i have psy during that time. however, i will be going to the psy si today from 4-5 p. m. this time, i know where the building is. i think these si classes are good ideas because it is a follow up to the lecture that students receive in class. so, if i missed something, i could go to the si and re-learn what i did not understand. now, there is no excuses for not understanding material. i did an assignment like this one in my typing class last year. it was the same exact prompt: let your mind flow freely onto the screen. that assignment was only for five minutes though. right now in the library, there is a long line for the computers. i hate waiting in lines. today i waited in line to draw football tickets to the ut vs. rutgers game on saturday. i hope ut wins the football game. i am a big fan of football. in high school i was in band. that means that i got a free ticket to go to every football game. however, our football team was not that good. i think that psychology will be an interesting class. i like learning about people and the things they do. i am looking forward to an interesting semester. i hope that the class is not too hard. some questions that come to my mind right now is why do students have to do this writing assignment? what kind of research is this? what will this writing assignment tell about students? i will also be doing the experiments instead of the research paper.

i'm wondering how long it's going to take me to find a girl i really like and if girls look at me as cute or a skinny dork. i miss my dog and the country life i use to live in. i'm scared of not making the baseball team and not completing my goal of pitching in the majors. i'm pissed off at my parents for not getting me a new car for graduation. i'm wondering if people act like they're cool with me when i'm around and make fun of me when i leave. i wish i had perfect teeth so i wouldn't have to get braces. i'm wondering if i'll ever forget my first love and if she'll ever forget me. i wonder why people look down on pot smokers even though their parents probably did it. i wonder when i'm a upper classman if girls will want me more and if i'll look different. ,0,-1.763005 2.628383 1.798673 2.312123 2.017354 -0.850412 -1.60799 -1.803822 -1.421089 -1.900627 -0.086039 -0.590446 1.833091 -0.535685 -0.820546 0.0 -0.04277 1.587181 2.769976 -0.795527 2.708312 -0.742368 -0.282977 1.187744 -0.624052 -0.209312 1.59959 -0.521815 -0.372428 -0.366397 0.296875 -1.430891 -0.125128 0.746677 0.105711 0.383294 0.79845 0.035868 1.04346 1.479312 -1.038726 1.210208 -2.064894 -0.499075 2.40104 -1.542652 -1.093488 -0.110447 -1.817532 -0.932058 3.654469 -1.542623 -1.303311 -0.740642 -0.85749 -0.592484 -1.052448 4.097296 -0.134721 -2.401117 -0.209713 1.995223 -0.480161 0.881171 1.070809 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.532773 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 2.923687 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.194237 5.028206 4.103517 4.609474 4.531596 4.444126,311
"i really could care less that i'm doing it at this moment. however, i care about my grade in the class, so that is why i am typing. lately i've really been curious about the ut environment and atmosphere. it seems to me that everything that an authoritative figure has to say is always an understatement of what is actually expected. for example, one of my professors indicated within a span of less than ten seconds that we should read over chapters one through four for the next session. when i got back to my dorm room i opened the book, thumbing through the chapters, and realized that this man expected the class to read a total of one-hundred and fifty pages in two nights!! i don't consider myself lazy, but this seemed like quite an astronomical expectation for such a subtle suggestion. college life seems to be okay. i have a lot of free time, but when i really think about it, time flies so quickly that my free time is gone. i like my math class but can't stand the discussion lectures. i feel that they are a complete waste of time, until we actually cover material that i haven't seen. when this occurs, i'm really in for it because i'll be forced to attend the lectures. i really have a hard time understanding the ta, because he gets so excited about math that he talks too fast. people who get excited about math should do the world a favor and jump off a cliff. just kidding, don't come searching for me because i said a morbid thing like that. my sense of humor is pretty violent. i like it when people have desensitized themselves enough to understand and enjoy that sense of humor that i possess. there is nothing that i can't stand more, however, is someone that totally does not understand my sense of humor and thinks that i am some sick individual. typing for twenty minutes really sucks. i think i am getting carpal tunnel disease. i've never experienced so much pain in my wrists. i think i am going to slit them right now. with a dull razor blade. then i'm going to cut my arms off and beat my roommate over and over with them. once he has experienced maximum horror, i'm going to chop off his leg and leave him there to wither and die and horrible death. then i'm going to go dive off a bridge onto i-35 and do triple somersault face-plant onto the oncoming traffic. hopefully i'll traumatize someone in the car and cause them to go off the deep end. i'm just kidding. would never do such a thing. anyway, classes are going pretty good, i'm getting a real good taste, as a freshman, of what college life is all about. i really enjoy having a mission or goal if you will, to get to class, and actually completing it on my own without parent supervision, or guidance, rather. in general, i enjoy the individualistic atmosphere here. however, i have become quite disturbed with the fact that no one talks to one another, perhaps because of pride, shyness, commitment to fulfill an independent lifestyle. whatever it is, i'm troubled. i have repetitively made eye contact with numerous females on numerous occasions, but they don't look back. i smile but they don't respond. what a bunch of robots. i've never, ever, ever, ever had trouble communicating with the opposite sex before. new challenges await me. oh well, time's up, hope you've had fun over-analyzing me. oh wait, my name doesn't really matter, i'm just another statistic, or another number. got to get used to it.

"i am currently sitting in the computer lab in the lobby of jester. i have just finished my final class for the day, so i figured that i would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. i have never taken any kind of psychology class, so i don't really know what to expect. hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and i wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. i liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that i was still in it. i sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. i went home for the labor day holidays and partied with them, but now that i'm back in austin everything has changed back again. i haven't really met many people since i've been here, but i can say that there are quite a few weird people. hopefully i will get use to austin soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. i've already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since i moved in two weeks ago. my parents aren't too happy with me right now, so i've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. i keep screwing up on this computer and don't really know what i'm doing. i never have been too good with computers-even though i have taken several classes in high school. i can type rather quickly, but that is about all. my fingers are getting tired of typing because i haven't typed all summer. i guess i need to get use to it since i'm going to be doing a lot of it now that i'm in college. i'm not too happy right now because i have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. i just brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but i can't get the cd-rom to work. the stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so i haven't been able to hook up the ut connect package that i just bought. i think i made a few people mad when i went to purchase that ut connect package because there was a long line and i sort of cut to the front on accident. i was just trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought that i had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. even though the guy that i cut in front of looked kinda pissed, i wasn't about to turn around and get at the back of the line. last week i waited in it over an hour and even though i feel kinda bad for that guy, it was worth it. my eyes are getting tired of staring at this screen and i'm for my time to be up. i guess i still have a few minutes until dinner starts so i'll write for a little while longer. i didn't get much sleep last night because i just couldn't fall asleep for some reason. some friends and i watched the movie the program, and that lasted until about 2:30, and i still couldn't go to bed after that. i didn't have to wake up until 10:00, but i only had like 5 hours of sleep. hopefully i can go to bed tonight with no problem. my hands are getting a little sweaty from typing so much, but i really do like to type. i'm not all familiar with the internet and the web, but i would like to be. i'm in an english lab class, so that will probably help me out a lot. i'm sitting next a guy that can type about 400 words a second-at least that's what it sounds like-and it is kind of getting on my nerves.

"well, i'm not exactly sure what to write about. i just finished my prescreening for the psychology experiment stuff and i now have to 1. 5 credits for it. so i only have to get 3. 5 more i guess to get the 5. i hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long. i hate typing when i have rings and bracelets on. i really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. i don't know how i'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes. i just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. i have so much homework to do this weekend. i guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. i guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. i also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. i have to go to dallas to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, i really don't want to go though. we never talk anymore and why should i go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to. oh, i met these friends at ut. they are so great. one of them really. her name is sarah and she's really nice. i think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one i have this year. she lied to me about everything and i think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. the other day i heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm. i don't know what they were talking about, that is just what i heard. carol is talking about sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. she thinks sarah is so cool. i wonder if what i eat is actually eating a lot or if i'm just eating a normal amount of food. i try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn't always great. oh, kinsolving isn't all that great. some of the food is good, but i can't stand eating there every day. they need to have food on this campus other than chicken. i love chicken and i used to want it all the time, but now since i've been here i've been dying for beef. the other day i was so stupid. i was talking to carol on the phone and i said, ""i'm tired, but i don't want to lay down. i'm bored but i don't want to do anything. i'm not hungry, but i'm dying for meat. "" i bet i sounded so stupid. i drove home today from austin. i really didn't want to becuase i haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but i really need to start driving again. i can't wait till i get to go to casa ole again. i can't believe austin doesn't have them here. that is like the stupidest thing in the world. i take that back. the stupidest thing in the world is that ut doesn't sell dr. pepper anywhere! how can they do that! if you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like dr. pepper the best. my mom just woke up. i finally found one places on campus that has it though. the union has dr. pepper at the taco bell. i haven't checked anywhere else yet. my dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today. i can't believe that happened. they live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. my dogs are fighting. i have two dogs, milo and brewser. milo is a red beagle that is brewser's son and he turned a year old may 15, 2004. brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on october 11, 2004. it's weird to think of their age. milo is really crazy and brewser is really calm. it probably is because he is so old though. i felt so stupid today in biology. we had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, i sort of knew the answer but i didn't have it completely right. the second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. when i was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in ""if, then"" form. meaning that this would be an example, ""if we put this together, then this should happen. "" in this class though, its just a statement. no ifs. no thens. no questions. it just made me feel stupid cause i could pick the hypothesis out of the group. there there was the last question that she asked and i had no clue about it. all that really scared me though because i am afraid of not making it in austin here at ut. out of my high school we had 106 seniors. out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or army. out of those 59, 35 went to atm. i can't get over that. only 2 of us came to ut and that is me and my ex boyfriend, nathan. i am afraid of what all my atm ""friends"" would say if i couldn't make it here. i really don't know what to talk about. i keep making all these stupid noises just because i can't think of what to say. my sister is now watching who wants to be a millionaire and my dad just ate some m&ms. my mom is out feeding milo and brewser. oh, milo is actually mine. i was too young for brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's. carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in temple. the dog's name is bart. carol is laughing at me because she is reading what i am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. i have to say, that since i've been writing it, i have to agree. i think it's kind of cool, but i really don't see the point in having to write this all out. well, i understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. oh, well. i'm getting credit for it. oh, i might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. i'm going to try to get to tickets to the austin city limits thing. sarah and gabby were telling me about it and while i was in class today they tried to go get tickets. gabby got one but while sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her.

"i love this song so much. well, actually i love the band. our lady peace, where did they come up with this name? it doesn't matter but it's just a question. i can't help but think back to freshman year of high school and remember the times that these songs remind me of. those were good times. ahh, well times change and new things come along. geeze, i'm so hungry. i can't wait to go eat with mom and dad. they are so great. i can't believe how much money they've spent on me and sam for college so far. wow, that's a lot and i'm so lucky. this next song is so good. i love this whole cd. music is such a great thing to have. it expresses feelings that you can relate to and it is a great way to relax. school is so different. i don't know what to study and there is so much reading. i feel so overwhelmed. oh, the football is is tomorrow. i'm so excited about it. they better win. and the red sox i hope will keep on winning. i want them so badly to go to the playoffs, even if they are the wildcard. they deserve it. isn't it funny how you come to like something? for example, how i became to like the redsox. i know i came to like them because of michael. it's funny how you like something or show interest in something that the person your dating likes. i couldn't help but like them because he did and it gave us something to talk about and be interested in. i like the redsox now and it came from him. he is such a great person. i can't believe we've been together for this long. almost 3 years is such a long time, but it has been great. he is sweet, funny, kind, nice, beautiful and he makes me feel good. he is my best friend. i can't wait to go get my pedicure today with andrea. it will be good to see her and spend time with her, she is such a sweet girl and is always willing to talk to me. it's weird not seeing all my friends from high school. i miss them so much. i can't anna had a baby! she is such a great mom and everything, but she is missing out on so much not being able to go to ut or saint mary's like she wanted to. i'm glad she is determined to still take classes at acc though. she is making the best out of her situation and i'm so proud of her. and ella, her baby. what a beautiful baby! i love her so much. i can't wait until she can play and talk. i want to play with her and just be able to have fun with her. i want to spoil her even though she isn't my baby. i'm getting so tired just sitting down. i want to do something, maybe, vacuum the room. it's getting kind of dirty. i want to eat! i miss my animals. i want them to live with me here in the dorm. i love petting them and giving them attention. i'm glad i went home yesterday. even though i go home at least once a week, i miss being there. i miss my brother, parents, and the animals. andy is so funny. he has no one to play with or antagonize. he tries to wrestle with mom and she can tell that he misses us. this is the best song on this cd. it is so pretty.

"right now i'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me. there is so much reading that i have to get done and so little time with all the classes i am taking. right now i am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done. right now i am hearing dead silence as my roommates and i are all studying in the same room. i am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me. right now i am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but i'm trying my best to stay awake. as i type, i'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if i'm ever going to get that done tonight. at this instant i'm noticing how there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much i miss them. i'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day. i am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how i am going to pass them. i'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits. right now i also feel sad because i really miss my family. it's so hard for me to be away from them because i'm so close to them. i especially miss my little bother and little sister. they always make me laugh. today my day was tough. i hardly understood what was going on in there so i had to stay after class and ask questions. as for my critical thinking seminar, i had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about. right now i'm hearing no noise at all and it's just making me tired. i feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it's making my eyes dry.

"my mind is fried from the test that i just took. did i do well? did i screw up?. did i get tickets to the football game. jeff was supposed to have a friend draw. i hope our seats are good, because today has been a rough day. i hope jeff likes me. this writing assignment makes me feel really funny because of all my sporadic thoughts. i wonder if this is one of the papers you decide to read, or if it is just going to end up in some data bank somewhere. i hope psychology is going to be a semi easy course because college at this point is a little overwhelming. my roommate just walked in, so i guess i should mention her. allison or ally, whatever i feel like calling her at the time. she fun, makes me laugh, i could use that right now. the test was easy but what if i just screwed up on it because it was my first test. i guess i will know by today what the event will be. the pressure to make good grades is getting to me. i want to have fun and do a little bit of everything, but i don't know how to fit it all in. i want to party with my friends, but i also want to do well. how far will that get me in life. what if i bust my butt and nothing happens. i'm beginning to notice a pattern in my thoughts; they are all questions. does that mean i'm missing the answers, or does that mean i worry too much. here i go with the questioning again. i'm trying not to be clich'd and do the average, i wonder if so and so likes me, but it is ending up like that. all of my life is in a state of not knowing. for everything that i have learned, it seems like there is much more because everything that i know doesn't answer all of my questions. that's where i get my nosiness, i guess. i classify myself as an ambulance chaser. the time is flying a lot faster than i thought. scooby doo is on tv, that is kaitlyn's favorite show. she's at home in dallas. i miss her so much and that reminds me that zach's surgery is going to be tomorrow. he's so little, will he be ok. more questions. they are driving me nuts (feel sorry for the reader). here's the issue of time again. i'm running out of it, literally and figuratively. i guess its nap time, i don't even know if i want to do that for sure.

" i like the idea of doing class assignments over the www. it's much easier. i think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers. students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student. i wouldn't like that however. something would be lost without the direct personal lectures. a person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater impression on me than any computer text ever could. i feel like i'm sticking with this subject too long, i'm thinking with too much structure. but i think that is the way i am. before i communicate, whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone, i usually have a solid idea of what i'm going to say. i don't usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness. i hear someone whistling in the hall, he's probably an active who will make me clean some mess up. oh well. wow i reached the second line, i just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text; like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing. isn't that ironic. i have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling. but if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper, that would mean that what i'm thinking is just meaningless rambling. it's always like that. my mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation (this chair isn't too comfortable) at light speed. no matter how fast i write, i don't think i could ever capture the zany, random, chaotic, and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant. but if they become forgotten how do i know about them? i wonder what i'll do tonight. i'm not sure at all. it's one of those times when i could have fun doing anything. i might. i don't know. it doesn't even matter. i don't know what else to write. i'm at a loss. maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency. i just went from the imaginative (sort of) colorful thought chord (you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book), to a superficial lethargic tone. i feel like a cave man, the only thing my mind says right now is ""food. "" thank you.

"it is about 509 and my roommates comp is making some noise and it has stopped now. i am now thinking about what i will (telephone noise) do when it is 529. that is when i will stop typing. i am thinking a bout my girlfriend. she is at a and m. i have a yaga sticker on my cd case. i took my cds out of my chest the other day, i mean yesterday, becaues i am not really worried about people stealing them any more. i once heard tht people sometimes steal toher peoples' pilows. my gir(keyboard is on my lap but io just took it off because i don't like that) i wish i could type faster but i can type plenty fast enough to do what i need to do. i have not really been using a lot of instant messenger lately. there are some people that i think it would be awkward to talk to like my gf. we kind of left withoutut breaking up but we both know it will not work ou. when i told my friend adam that she felt the same as me but i showed him her email and he believed me. she is not really like most girls and i said that was cool and he agreed with me. i like to abbreviate when i typ and that comes from working on emails. i stopped for a seconnd to scroll up on the mouse because it does not move down by itself. i am now thinking how i do not type fast enough to say exactly what i think when i think it but i have to remember things (other things) as i am typing the thought that directly preceded it. my roommates are now staring at me as i type this and i am writing about it because that is what i am supposed to do. i hve stopped for a second to tell them about what the prof said today about the guy copyin gand pasting the computer manual and i thought that was pretty funny. my cousin did one of these stream of consciousness things and i don't think that i spelled that correctly. i think that this is getting pretty long enough and i will prolly cut it short before my time is up because i can. i know that rice university has the honor system and i don't know whether that would be cheating or not . it is now 518 and i have been typing for about nine minutes. whenever i write numbers i think it is easier if i just spell the number out but thinking back to this writing assignment, i have been spelling the time, so i don't know what that means. the social security comment was funny today. i accidentally came late to my french class today, the first day of school of all times, because i was playing squash and i thought it started at three instead of two. i actually think the yaga thing on my cd case is pretty cool even though yaga is not really a well known brand anymore. i would like to go to the gym todya but i would also like to et a head start on the homework because i am still pretty motivated toward school, and i hope i will keep it up but i'm really not that sure because i know that this is different thatn highschool and i think i will like it more but my french teacher today told us some fascinating things about how speech is first started in babies and i was fascinated but then i went after calsss and apologized becase i was late. there is some real audo stuff we shoudl do for homework but i would like to do it in my own room instead of in the library becaus i don't know if we have to talk in to the computer or what. i am going to go now and i'd lkike to play some squash because it is fun.

"this is one of the most interesting assignments to date in my educational career. never before have i submitted my work over the computer. i pretty much knew what i was going to write about when i got down here. my ex-girlfriend. she brings out a lot of sensations and feelings, and i can say most have been pleasant, but not lately. the guy next to me seems pretty cool. some guy just sat down by me. looked like he was lost or maybe self-conscious because he didn't sit long. i guess this place isn't so bad. i've got a hangover. which isn't too bad, considering me excessive intoxication the night before. what a bitch. people type too damn loud!! the guy running this place seems somewhat dorkey. may that be an understatement. ryan will be happy to know that i am finally going to break it off with her. it's what he wanted, and i too, but i couldn't do it myself. she's too damn manipulating and she's a bad, bad person. who the hell is she to think that i'll always be here to pick her ass off the ground like some sort of surrogate mother. last time i checked i don't have any breasts to breast-feed her. but i'll tell you who does. tiffany amber thiessen (also known as val on 90210). they can't be real, say the girls i was watching the show with. what makes them experts on breasts, maybe the fact that they've had them for a long time. but every damn time a girl seems some guy with a ripped ass body they never take in to consideration that that shit could very well be fake, too. i wonder what that loud noise was. i think i curse to damn much. oh well. yes that would be a cute chick next to me. but she doesn't look all that good. i don't see any fine girls in here. people talk too much. there are a lot of fine girls here but not as many as were anticipated. now sixth street is where you'll find a lot of honnies. sixth street is where you'll find a lot of stuff, that's where i got my tattoo, which everyone has said they liked it except the artist(known as forest) who tattooed it on my back. probably because there's too much detail and his lazy ass didn't want to do it all. i've got four more minutes left to this assignment and some guy just dropped his calculator. dumbass. i'm thirsty . und ein bischen hungry, that was a little german for those wondering(hope i spelled it right). it's odd as soon as we see someone or meet someone we immediately pass judgment on them, we don't know these people but we judge them one first impressions. which can be positive or bad. my first impressions come off better when i've had a little to drink, not that my sober impressions come off as bad, i can always entertain people better when i've had a little to drink. . gotta go ",1,0.296045 -0.153284 -1.279231 0.235014 0.178811 0.455826 0.425468 0.495032 -0.642833 -0.488206 -0.192744 -0.590446 0.666649 -0.098372 -0.689283 0.0 -0.04277 -0.651698 -1.369181 0.391899 -1.339057 0.122833 1.126753 -0.260313 1.382051 0.285918 -1.119799 0.196896 0.798873 0.217478 -0.225432 0.27791 0.945321 -0.906028 1.444596 -0.642023 -0.503347 -1.354547 0.084707 -0.653762 -1.038726 1.437629 0.675047 0.863227 0.968983 0.436445 -0.333846 1.49667 -0.213116 1.22933 3.350513 -0.46714 0.69346 -1.11642 0.674786 1.408104 -0.446708 3.790296 -0.236181 1.127674 -0.314865 0.275896 0.079385 0.78233 5.024055 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.386841 -0.018423 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.094045 0.463382 -0.422267 1.204517 2.949554 0.596008 0.782404 5.025142 3.326685 4.293658 4.088516 5.291574,245
"i used to day dream about this time when i was younger. after i saw my brother and sister leave for college, i decided that was going to be the best part of my life. of course, it is a lot different now that i am here. there is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams. i don't really mind it so far. i want to be able to handle it, and i am excited about my classes. i wish that i could be an expert in every subject that i take. psychology is very interesting to me, but not enough to be my major--i wouldn't want to do it for the rest of my life. my brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from southwest texas, but he hasn't done much with it. i am taking this class as a social science elective; my other classes are required for my major. right now i am an undeclared major, but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course, i am pretty sure that i want to major in geosystems engineering. it seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that i am interested in, and it would be a job that pays pretty well. if i did well enough at ut to get into grad school, i would love to follow it up with a masters or phd in geology. of all the courses i have taken in high school and college, these seem to be the best ones. some of my favorite subjects are: geology, geography, astronomy, archaeology, and history. i would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough. my reason for this is that eventually i would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of austin--near a lake--with a boat. this requires $$. i love the outdoors, and i want to live away from the city, yet close enough to it that i could drive into town to do things. this is probably a common ambition among people, but i don't really care. enough rambling about all that. my reason for being here at ut is to learn, and to get an education, and to do well. if i do all of this i will be very pleased. it will be hard though. i love to have fun, and that can easily get in the way at ut. i haven't joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet, even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me. i want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things. hopefully that will work out. these are the things that are on my mind at the moment; at least until i move on to the next thing.

"okay, i guess this is what all my english teachers described as ""stream of consciousness. "" i believe i did an assignment similar to this in 11th grade. i'm not sure. i wonder how long this writing assignment will be. how much can i possibly type for 20 minutes straight without stopping? what if i get a phone call? do i answer it? anyways, i cannot believe i am in my second week of college. it is kind of what i expected. the freedom can me nice at times, but i do miss my home. i do not miss high school at all though. i didn't like high school one bit. i am more homesick than i ever thought i would be, or could be for that matter. i never thought of myself as someone who would get homesick. but here i am, always wanting to call home. michelle's birthday is tomorrow. i wish i could fly down to spend the day with her. i hope mom remembers to give her the cd i made her. the cd reminds me of justin, whom i also miss a lot. i miss all my friends, all my best friends. one of which is at utd, one going to northwestern in a few days, and one attending texas women's. i really wish i could transfer, or they would transfer to ut. i miss them all so much. wow, it has only been 5 minutes. i don't know if i have 20 minutes of gibberish to write about. this stream of consciousness thing is harder than it seems. i know i tend to ramble on a lot but it is quite different when you are doing it for a class assignment. it is also hard for me because i am so used to typing with abbreviations every time i chat online, making this assignment a lot more difficult. after completing this, i am going to wait for a phone call from my best friend. then, meet up with someone at the library, where i hope to get a lot of studying done. i feel like i am so behind in all my classes. i have a lot of reading to do. senioritis has not gone away, and i have yet to get back into the ""homework mode. "" that's not good. i really would like to leave here with a high gpa. i know that is what my parents would really like. yet, it seems harder and harder as days go by. there are so many things to do here that it seems harder to organize my week. i am usually a very organized person but haven't been as of late. man, i wonder if iris is going to call me anytime soon. i feel like i haven't talked to her in forever. i would really like to fly down and stay with her for a weekend. i'm thinking about the weekend of her birthday. though, i'm not sure if that is a good idea. i need to get the money together first. oh yeah, i also need to get some money for lisa's birthday gift. it's her birthday tomorrow. wow, i wish my friends would chip in money and buy me a camera. that's really neat that ivy is doing that. i'm so glad i finally got my camera fixed. stupid battery. how does a battery die out so quickly? i haven't even had my camera for that long. i put up my collages today before lunch. they look really nice on my wall. i think i put them up crooked though. oh well, i will get used to it, i hope. i would really like to fill up my whole wall with it. that would be so neat! okay, 6 more minutes. man, i haven't typed this much in a long time. my eyes are starting to hurt now, and i still have a headache. today is monday. tomorrow is tuesday. tomorrow is going to be a very busy day, from beginning to end. i will probably be dead tired by the end of the day and won't have enough energy to study. that will not be good. i want to watch tv. i wonder what is on right now. lisa said she was going to watch friends and then roswell. all right, now i am running out of things to type. i don't think my brain works very fast. these last few minutes are going by very slowly. i hope i don't get hungry tonight at the library. i cannot believe i ate so much today at lunch. it is all leeting's fault. all that starch cannot be good for me. i really hope i do not gain a lot of weight while in college. i'm really scared that i will. i haven't been going to the gym as often as i would like. i think i might start going every friday or so. maybe on the weekends too, seeing as how i haven't been in austin for the weekend since school started. maybe that is why i still have not put together a regular schedule. i haven't really been here for a full week. well, this will be my first full week in college. not as exciting as i thought it would be. i think i might call home after i finish this assignment. i'm almost done, thank goodness. i really am running out of things to type. i think i am all drained out. i hope i do not fall asleep studying tonight. i really need to get stuff done.

" i'm not really sure what exactly i'm supposed to do with this. there is some guy in my room that keeps trying to talk to me and i don't know him. i wonder why he's in here. theres a really old song playing on the radio. i havent heard it in a while. it reminds me of 6th grade. every song does that, takes me back to a different place in time. now this song reminds me of my friends jason and doug. i wonder what they're doing right now. i miss my old friends. i'm really excited about this weekend. miami is going to be a blast. i just hope that everything works out. i really want to suprise john, but if i have to tell him i'm coming i guess i will. i really don't want to. that guy won't shut up. i'm thinking i might just take a cab from the airport to the university. my dad said theres a tropical storm. i sure hope it disentigrates before i get there. i hope everything works out with john, though. i think this weekend is going to be the deciding factor of our relationship. things are so tense every time we talk. i want to go back to that last night at his house. . it was so amazing. we stayed up the enitre night watching the meteor shower and talking out on his balcony. one of those moments i will never forget even when i'm old. i wonder what i will be like when i'm old. i want to be a cool grandma. i want to live in a big old house on some land but drive a really badass car and cook good food for m grandkids and spoil them. i guess b efore i have grandkids, i have to have kids. which i don't want to do. i was watching the learning channel and man having those babies has to hurt. i could just have a c section. thats what my aunt did. but then she died of cancer. maybe i shouldnt have one. this cough is getting really old. i always get colds. last time i had one was before me and john met though. he brought me flowers for the first time. white dasies on the red tahoe outside of my room. i miss that. the note said he didnt have any soup. flowers would have to do. i love that. if i could right now, i would fly to miami and marry this boy. i remember the day my sister got married. it was the most beautiful thing i've seen. of course i would do it differnetly if it was my wedding&gt; ok now my computer is freaking out&gt; ummm i don't know what i did but it won't quit! ok this is going to bother me so much&gt; i hate that when something happens with your computer and you don't know how to fix it&gt; sometimes these things are just too smart for their own good&gt; my eye itches but i can't itch it&gt; wierd&gt; i wonder why you can't itch inside&lt; but it itches anyways&gt; hmm&gt; i wonder why your foot will just fall asleep all of a sudden and you can't wake it up&gt; why do they say it fell asleep? it smells like peanut butter in my room because my roomate is making a pb&j sandwich&gt; i m hungry now too&gt; i couldnt eat at olive garden earlier because i was coughing too much&lt; but now its a little better&gt; i should try to eat something&gt; i wish there was just a pill that you could take that would be food&gt; it would be a universal thing&gt; food takes up so much of our time and lives&gt; we would live cheaper&lt; have more time to do other things&lt; and probaly wouldnt have so many overweight people&gt; thats a good idea&gt; i think im going to come up with one of those&gt;&gt;&gt; ",1,-0.466982 1.178998 0.941703 0.910054 0.945266 0.870239 -0.964649 -1.308656 -1.088923 0.140378 -0.16822 -0.314557 0.905522 -0.596228 -0.965408 0.0 -0.04277 0.350004 0.16178 0.341237 0.262583 0.58289 -0.33137 -1.356311 0.40022 -0.333696 -0.887764 -0.426819 -0.704017 -0.044891 -0.765241 0.205003 -0.959193 -0.509752 -0.748532 -0.03565 0.177937 -0.289589 -0.523779 1.073735 -0.496958 0.323759 -0.43278 0.555744 -0.204904 0.478316 0.070083 0.003866 0.025623 0.033138 0.33192 0.592574 0.034649 -0.300802 0.522912 0.054595 0.18819 -0.954251 -0.606459 -0.608819 0.549243 0.124014 -0.480161 -0.355239 -0.546834 2.197029 -0.086094 0.03375 -1.020919 -0.073676 20.369495 -0.34493 -0.193585 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.021455 -0.451544 6.516986 0.932355 3.845752 3.538409 5.412616 5.163013 5.375112,1736
"twenty minutes seems like a long time. it amazes me how weird time is. like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. i spend alot of time on planes. my dad is a pilot. i fly free. i don't know what i will do after college, because then i don't fly free anymore. i won't be able to go anywhere whenever. my roommate is in the shower. she has a sorority thing tonight. i'm not in a sorority. i'm glad, it's not the place for me. a guy died in my hometown last weekend. i t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and mother theresa and princess diana had just died. i didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. i think about that a lot. death. like what if someone died that i knew, but i had never told them what they mean to me. that's selfish, i know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. we as in humans. a friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. i like country music, but most people don't. i just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. my back hurts. i like to rub people's backs. i wish someone was here to rub mine. tonight i'll be alone in the dorm. i like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. my roommate and i knew each other in high school. we have gotten along amazingly well so far. knock on wood. i have never been in a car accident, when i was driving. my brother messed up his knee in a car accident. i like this song. he had to have his acl ligament redone. he can be such a baby. i think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. i really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. that's just a personal opinion. i give lots of personal opinions. people tell me i'm opinionated. i don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. it's important to be able to communicate. i'm a speech major. my undergrad advisor is great. i met him at orientation, and i love him. he tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. i don't like this song. it's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. i wonder if i'll get married. i think i want to, but not kids. i do not want kids. that's another one of my opinions. how can we bring a child into this world? so then people ask me if i wish i hadn't been born. two completely different concepts. anyway, i'm gonna call my aunt holly. she is like a second mother to me. i live my mother. she really is my lifeline. that's a scary thought, like could i survive without her? of course, she raised my to be a survivor. i love basketball. my mom and i watch games together all the time. the rockets are my favorite team. i also like dennis rodman. but i hat e the bulls. rodman always says what he is thinking. some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but i love it. h breaks the mold. that's commendable in my book. i miss my cousins. one of them is a big basketball fan. he and i always talk basketball. i'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as i thought it would. i really like this song. i'm finished!!

"we got a new couch today in our dorm room, i think that i like it but it has a kind of weird smell to it. i put some febreeze on it , i mean what can you expect from a 10 dollar garage sell couch. i am becoming kind of concerned about the study habits that i am developing here in austin. it seems that every day i do nothing and at night i realize that i have all this work to do and that i have not actually done any of it. i stay up late doing work and don't get enough sleep. so all day i feel tired. i wish that i had not ate so much tody. my stomach is seriously hurting me. i think that since i have come to austin i am still eating a lot but i have stopped all physical activity. i really should go to the gym or go running or atleast get some of the guys around here to go play some basketball or something. i feel realy guilty right now, i was supposwd to go to churh tonite at 10, but i didn't get back from eating out with my friends until around 11. my mom called me after i had got in and i told her that i had gone at ten and that i was just getting back. i don't feel so bad about lying as i really do about not going. i consider myself to be afairly devote catholic, this is the first time that i can remember not going to church on a sunday. i tried to remember, i was sure that i had missed atleast once before, but i thought about it for along time and this is the first time in forever that i have not been on a sunday. i'm thinking right now how easier it would be to write this if my roomate and his girlfriend were not here. i keep feeling like they are reading what i am writing, and i think that i am right, those bastards, just kiddin they are both reallygood friends. they just called me out on calling them bastards, they thought it was kind of funny. they just put on mtv, man i hate the backstreet boys. and that would be 20 minutes.

" so the first week of school has begun and i am not ready at all! i already feel like i am loosing my mind. which is not a good way to start off the school year. i am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. first, i am taking cms 306m, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. then i am taking eco 304k with an amazing professor. i am very excited about this class but i have heard that it is a little difficult so i will definatly have to pay attention and study. i am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is troy kimmel-the weather man! so i am excited about that because he seems like a fun person! i am also taking edp369k which is a community service class. we have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours. i think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business'place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. this class should be interesting. i think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. this class is just something i need to take. finally, i am taking your psy class which i am very excited about as well! pennebaker seems very laid back and cool. with the music at the beginning of each class, etc. i don't know, i think i might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). i really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. i am a sophomore so i am not as scared as i was last year. last year i was very intimidated so i studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return i ended up with a 3. 888 (which my parents are enthused about!) but this year i am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. i just really need to get out of the summer mode where i go out every night and do nothing but work and party. i need to calm down and study'read a bit more than i am now. i think i will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. so hopefully ill get my act together soon. anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first chapter meeting. that's right, i am in a sorority-alpha chi omega-and i love it! we just went through rush where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. my little alpha sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever! she knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time! i just love her. next week we get our chi sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our omega sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our lil' sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. so this semester should be very exciting! this year i am living in the axo house with my pledge class of '03 and i wasn't so sure about it last year but i really love it! i am getting to know my pledge class so much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound! haha. anywho, we have a date dash on thursday and i am not sure which boy to take! haha. i always seem to have boy problems. but o well, that's all part of being a college student (i guess). anywho, there is this one boy who is a sigma chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. and really cute but then there is a wrangler whos name is matt who i kind of talked to last semester. he use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality! which really sucks. i think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. i mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and i tottally trust him. and he's 21 (haha). but i can't help it if i am not attracted to someone. i mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. but in a way i feel like i owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. but then again i don't want to lead him on and then ""break"" his heart. because that's just cruel! okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). he is super cute and very interesting. i think i could hold several very interesting'intelligent conversations with him. i think he could teach me a lot about life in general. anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this date dash and i would love to go with him but i feel like i owe it to these other guys, that i have been spending more time with. so right now i am a very confussed person-and considering it is monday night i kind of need to make up my mind really fast. okay, so there's the sigma chi-names forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. then there's matt-the wrangler-who is so nice but i would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. then there is ryan who is someone i look very much foward to getting to know better. so we shall see how things go. i know everything happens for a reason so i will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out! right?? well, i have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes. i guess i had a lot to get off of my cheast. this is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out! haha, good idea! o yeah, i tried signing up for an experiment project but then i realized i signed up for the wrong day so i hope that doesn't affect my grade. whopps! o well, there's nothing i can do about that now. this weekend is our first home football game which i am very excited about!

"i am very excited right now, because in a couple of hours i will be on a plane to washington dc to visit my boyfriend, but i am also a little anxious because lately we have been fighting more than usual, so i am not sure what will happen this weekend. i just hope everything goes well. i just talked to my friends that live there; i am very excited to see them as well. they are planning a lot of things to do with me this weekend; it's going to be fun. i am also a little worried because i am going to miss my lasses tomorrow, but i am a good student so i hope to catch up soon. i missed classes the day before yesterday too, and i bout some gifts for my little sisters. i miss them a lot. i have five siblings, one brother who is the eldest, and 5 sisters, one older than myself, the other three younger. my older sister and i both study at ut, my brother studies law in panama, where my family lives. this is my third semester here. the first that semester i was here, i was very sad and depressed. i missed all my family very much, and felt so alone, because my sister had her own friends and i knew no body in this city, but then i got used to it, and now i love austin, i couldn't wait to get back from my summer vacation, even though i had a wonderful time in panama. i worked this summer in the finance department of the panama canal, and it was great. i also took a correspondence course from ut and did very well on it. but the best part of the summer was definitely going out with my friends. i went out almost every night, it was the best. i am not really sure what i was supposed to do with this paper, or if it's going to be right, i am just righting everything that i can think of. i really like this class. i have so much fun in it; the professor makes the class interesting and fun, something very hard to do with such a large class. i usually try to avoid large classes as much as possible, but i am glad that i got a chance to be in this one. well, time is about up. i am a really slow typist, because i only type with one finger, so this might seem shorter than the other. i really have to start typing like a normal person with two hands, but what can i do, right? well, i'm going to return to my packing, i've got to get up early tomorrow. see you next class.

" i wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, i am sneezing, coughing, and everything, it is crazy. i am surprising myself lately though. i thought i would be much more home sick, but i don't know what i am missing, or if i am missing anything at all. i know i miss work, nothing made me more happy really. i know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. one in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. i wonder when life is going to get easy. i have been working hard since i was 16, balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. trying is the key word. sometimes i think i missed out in high school. i was never the party type, only because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but i understand that they just want the best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they made. what they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because eventually i may be in the same situation that they were in, and i won't know what to do. if i were to live anywhere in the world i would live in england, surrey was nice. london is amazing. i don't know what to say other than when i was there i felt home, i loved it. i surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather than drive. i enjoy taking drives though. when i was at home, i enjoyed just grabbing my keys and going. i never had a particular destination, but my favorite drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. kind of like sailing. recently i joined the saililng club, it is nice, i wish there was more wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. it was so nice, and made time go by so fast. i feel so stupid about endochine, i can't believe we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. i feel so stupid. but then again there are a lot of times i feel stupid. too many to list. i can not wait to go to the football game. i miss band the most from high school, there was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the crowd was actually happy that we were there. i honestly never thought i would see the day that that would happen. christina aguilera's cd is very good, at least most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. it is surprising how cold it was this morning, here i am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like 70 unbelievable this is supposed to be texas. i am so glad my aunt and her partner are here , even if lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is still nice to see linda. i love accents, i wish i had an english accent. for some reason i especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with mate or love. another reason i want to move to london, i love the way they talk. i also love orlando bloom who also lives in england, he is gorgeous. but sometimes i wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. that irritates me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the way people gravel at their feet. they are no different from the average joe other than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet deal actually, i wish someone would pay me to be someone else so i could live a fairy tale. sometimes i wish life were like a movie, not like the faculty though. more like kate and leopold. mostly love stories, that would be amazing. though at the same time it might be too predictable. one can wish though right. i wonder what i am going to be when i grow up, i mean really grow up. i really have no likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if i have a personalitly, or if i am just here. how is it possible for people to exist anyways. i don't know if i buy the whole evolution thing or the bible. if the bible is true then were did the dinosaurs come from. and if vice versa then how did the bible come about. i still believe there is a god because i think it is important to have something to believe in. but sometimes i think what if god wasn't real. there would be many times i would be lost in my life in that case. for some reason. i think there is some sort of force that looks out for people, ",1,0.255088 -0.246614 0.120595 -0.29736 0.349454 0.41617 0.377082 -0.265441 0.096324 0.674295 -0.148236 -0.590446 -0.676818 0.179725

" i'm really full right now because i ate a lot of food tonight. i as going to go out to dinner with other friends, but just decided not to go. te reason is that idid't want to bother them. they are all guys, and i didn't want to be the only girl. anyway, i found out later that there were some other girls coming, but i just eating at that time already. a guy i like went there, too. i was going to go there because of him, but just didn't want to make it obvious taht i wanted to be with him. i am worried that he may not like me, but i'm pretty positive that he at least is interested in me. i was very worried in the biginning, though, because i wanted everything to happen so fast. all my friends advised me not to be that way since the most stable relationship is usually formed after a long time of being together. i guess i'm too impatient and too negative. i envy a lot of people who are positiv and self-confident. they are very proud of who they atr and not afraid of doing anything they want to do. i want to be that way. sometimes i'm just too scary to start doing anything. however, what is really strange is that i am self-confident. i am usually a leader among my classmates and always think i will do good at most of things. i think i'm not confident of love. especially, whenever i have somebody i like, i never consider myself worthy for him. usually, i will think he won't think i'm pretty and so on. all these negative images are pictured in my brain. i do that because i don't want to be so positive, what if i think of all these good things, and they never happen? what if something bad happens? what if he says he doesn't like me? it's much better to think of worse and let good things happen. however, sad thoughts make me really depressed often. i become so biased that i won't see what really is going on. i'd like to be so wise. i don't want to be biased or anything. i guess in order to be wise, i need to read as many books as i can. also, i think i need more experience. experience makes one mature and smart. when i was young, i didn't understand why people call the old the wise. however, as i grow, i realized so many things that i now started to understand. the longer i live, the more i see, hear, and think. i am so grateful that i'm still alive and anxious to learn more about the world. there are so many things i don't know, and that fact just makes me go on. i love learning, and sometimes, i get frustrated becuase i feel like there's not enough time for me to know all these things. it's just wonderful to see the world and all there different things within. different cultures, people, languages,and all these other things are very fascinating. i wonder how and when i will be able to experience everything! it is my dream to travel aroungd the world. i would love to travel and learn many things. i wonder i will be able to get a job and still traveil while working. i hope that can happen. maybe, i can travel during vacations, but that sounds not enought for me. i will like to travel several times a year. i really think ther's not enough time to see and learn. this is why i try to do more things everyday, but now i'm getting too lazy. college life is exciting, but also make ",1,1.001054 -0.596486 0.421057 -0.356841 0.776127 0.333215 0.107974 -0.706401 1.162588 -0.071675 -0.177207 0.270326 -0.30014 -0.308986 0.132662 0.0 -0.04277 -0.097804 0.60299 -0.795527 0.421972 -0.742368 -0.028717 1.312949 -0.624052 -1.327642 -0.594849 -0.875134 0.767322 0.934228 0.354642 -0.009943 0.117458 1.245273 -0.725426 -0.332158 1.305637 0.646513 1.962383 0.46772 -1.038726 0.330763 2.23873 -0.41497 0.232532 -0.445511 -0.777649 -0.768157 -1.150458 -0.472492 0.4759 -0.277277 -0.844103 0.361873 1.810885 -0.81455 -1.287071 -0.954251 0.02671 0.869512 0.76271 -0.66413 -0.480161 0.525013 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.026788 1.172708 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.248491 -0.178277 0.106665 -0.422267 0.443201 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.577318 5.095721 4.201506 4.743968 5.197119 4.524181,1805
"at the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how i will make it through college if i remain a procrastinator. thus, i am completing this assignment because i feel that i need to make changes in my study habits. moreover, i need to succeed at ut because i cannot afford to let my parents down. my parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if i fail in college. thus, failing is not possible. occasionally, i ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. at times, i feel, as though, i am a failure because i am constantly being compared to my older brother. everything that i do is not good enough and that i should be more like my brother; i guess one could say that i am always in my brother's shadow. moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. because they do this, i constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. in order to cope with this, i am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. each of these ""flings"" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. however, i am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because i know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. there is one thing good that has come of these experiences; i believe that i have found happiness with another. she makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who i am and not someone else. when i am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; i guess you can say she's my soul mate, but there is one thing i am sure of, i love her with all my heart. in fact, she has been the only girl i have actually told that i love her and actually meant it. just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile.

" as soon as i am done with this i plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. i don't really feel much like working. my biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. my telephone just rang. my air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that i have heard. right now i am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. we ate at wendy's and the food was salty. i wish i was in a cold swimming pool right now. this weekend was fun. we went swimming in the lake. college is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. i dont' miss them terribly, but i just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. classes have not been that hard these first several days, and i am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. now i seem to have nothing on my mind. i am just staring at the computer screen. all i really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. my neck is still a little sore. i will take some aspirin later. i will check my mailbox later today. my bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. now i am not really thinking of much. i feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before i head out of my room. in fact, right when i am finished writing this i am going to lay on my bed. i am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. only about 90 days until christmas break.

"i can't believe that i waited until the very last minute to do this. i've never beem so crazy stressed out of my mind ever in my life. i just couldn't find 20 minutes in the last seven days where i could just sit down when i wasn't totally fried. i hope that this dose not bode poorly for this semester. i think i can oull it out. this festival i can't believe that cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . i think i'm holding up but i feel that i coming apart now. i think that's what i scared about. this year i've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what i can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph i've learned so much. mostly about what kind of person that i am. what am i capable of. which is some great stuff. but i'm not there yet i 'm almost there though. it's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that i'm a t. a. or look to me for help. it's strange i guess people see good things in me. i like that annd i do the same thing. . i gues i'm just used to people being more aloof i hope that i'm not that way. some of the people that i have met at this festival have given me that instant companionship. that instant love and that's so great. . i guess when people are looking to me for answers wheither it's about their cameras of their relationships i guess that means i'm becoming the type of person that i want to be. . that's a great reward in itself. i smoked again two nights ago. i have to stop after quitting for two years i can't fall of the wagon and go back to that. . it was only a few cigs (one fantastic nat sherman mcd the very best) i can't let this girl. well she's not doing it really. i can't let the tantrum i'm throwing:) over this girl mess up what took a long time ito acheive i feel like a hypocrite when i smoke now. i don't know i just get lonely filled with self pity overwhelemed and i just want a catharsis. . smoking is sort of one. . i don't know i need ito stop again i don't think i 'll go back to the way it was but it's still scarey. i really think thigs are'nt as bad when i have a second to actually relax and evalute things i feel very good. . like the night before class tabling at the show i realized how many people i have met in the last year how many close friends that i'm making and have made and how important that i've become in certain peoples life and how much i'm going to be doing in the near future. it's all going to be worthwile i think i just feel impaitent it just seems like i've been waiting for ten years to get the chance to do what i want to do. what's going to be the best for me. and every bs class i have to take or everytime some jerk in communications office is rude to me and everytime i'm treated crappy at work it's just one bergman-esque humiliation after another. sometimes i hope that my artistic spirit doesn't die the death of a million pinpricks. . i really like this kind of writing it's been pretty theraputic, but i have to go ",1,-0.729578 0.523845 1.296223 0.159431 1.088613 -1.207464 -1.182918 -0.77253 -0.636519 -0.105755 -0.175912 -0.590446 -0.19535 -0.786062 -0.856292 0.0 -0.04277 -0.372256 0.926328 -0.795527 0.76312 -0.742368 -1.153788 -0.508114 -0.624052 -0.383352 -0.598883 0.513642 0.254152 -0.237032 -0.73143 0.730318 0.647102 0.839064 0.168525 -0.321297 -0.076586 -0.919615 0.146682 -0.949965 3.136422 0.374596 -0.011356 -0.743334 0.255759 -1.542652 0.507776 -1.394747 -0.915671 -1.643805 1.557584 0.976732 -0.610581 -0.106953 -0.365313 -0.947708 -1.275377 0.379232 -0.260012 0.676538 0.115376 -0.651049 -0.00837 -0.31588 -0.119816 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.223735 -1.288909 0.079248 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.112109 -0.422267 2.153597 0.504355 0.156027 0.193994 4.75242 3.869134 4.770384 4.694173 4.408184,1853

(homework for that matter) boy it's something else being 27 stories up. people look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. now i don't even know what i'm saying anymore. i feel sick from the food i ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. what else to say. . . . . i remembered i should call peggy since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. oh, and rob, well i need to inform him about the houston concert info. i wonder if those airline tickets to d. c. came in yet. and where are those items i ordered from the catalog? i'm beginning to worry. i cant believe b of a charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an atm. they also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an atm. outrageous. i'm really looking forward to go back home soon. i'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that i bought contact by carl sagan, which i keep intending to read, but never get around to it. i hate that. why did i buy the book? well i thought contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. it's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. carl sagan must have been a brilliant man. my next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. hmm what song is that?. oh yeah, semi charmed life. i should look for those guitar tabs later. that reminds me, should go to the party next door on sat. or not? i suppose it couldn't hurt, but then i'd get further behind on my studies. how long have i been writing so far? hmm. almost 20 min. i haven't really said anything profound which disappoints me, but then again, this is a stream of consciousness assignment. i'm liking college a lot. it gives me space ponder and let my mind wander. it's amazing the places one can go if you just set your mind free. i don't know why, but sometimes i have an impulsive urge to write poems or songs, but once i get distracted from that sudden drive, i lose the will to do so. i guess i have to be in a certain mood. i noticed that i had mere frequent occurrences when i first got here. perhaps it was due to the seclusion and sudden separation from friends and family. being in a strange environment w'o a guardian is harder than i thought. i feel like i'm being forced to grow up faster than i'd like to. but i suppose it builds character, and i have never been one to back down from obstacles. think of it as a gateway to another world. hmm time's up. my train of thought has sure been a wacky one. bunch of random thoughts strewn together. does this represent a part of who i am? certainly, but not hardly. maybe a paradox of some sort. one thought to add is that i have been such a weak willed person lately. i have those intentions, but i cant seem to get them to take root. that needs to change, and i guess i do notice a little improvement, but near as much as i'd like ",1,0.919707 0.005744 -1.409798 -0.562306 -1.040357 0.245861 0.917556 0.465069 0.426695 -0.048955 -0.220425 0.754511 1.382483 -1.074728 1.347975 0.0 -0.04277 -1.028206 -0.190352 -0.795527 -0.415065 -0.267098 -1.059161 -0.278056 -0.073059 1.232402 -0.243613 0.109527 -0.610917 -0.889636 -0.739825 0.681125 -0.064794 -0.479685 -0.43822 0.815905 0.430899 -0.160708 -0.372762 0.440313 1.292768 -0.086285 -0.308948 0.26538 0.546786 -0.183712 0.158366 -1.016316 0.826467 -1.400158 -0.314823 -0.627292 0.303544 -0.968484 -0.830627 0.293384 0.087226 -0.302685 -1.129374 0.338467 0.068593 -0.054331 0.441944 -0.745201 -0.546834 3.717696 -0.086094 0.695935 0.262248 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.089213 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.15016 0.482597 0.419142 0.610109 4.196856 3.658777 4.411428 4.369945 5.181794,23
" i am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow of my thoughts its about 1:30 in the morning the day of the first ut football game that was successfully won by the horns my roommate is sleeping right now it seem that he sleeps almost 14 hours a day it makes me mad that for some reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. all he does every day is go to class, which i guess i should give him credit for that, and when class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things or he lays in bed and watches tv or movies all day he is not that social either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any intramurals. he doesn't study whatsoever i guess i am just worried about him because i care about him i mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. it seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type and i was the reclusive type and about since the 10th grade the situation has taken a 180 degree turn i hope they televise the 49er game that they are playing against the rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate thinks that the 49er don't have a prayer i believe that this opportunity will be a coming out party for jj stokes and the emergence of jim drunkenmiller the last rookie quarterback to start for the niners was joe montana hopefully a good sign i am also kind of disappointed that i am not able to join the professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings when i have my ch301 extension course from 6 to7:30 pm but hey looking at the positive side i have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is great to be alive i feel like i am on top of the world everything is working like clockwork i feel like watching disney movies well it's about 2 o'clock so i guess that i should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - : ",0,0.986461 -1.069115 -1.381933 -0.840494 -1.259324 -0.348635 1.100758 1.446415 1.456707 -1.041057 1.170878 -0.590446 1.707694 -0.177356 0.756246 0.0 -0.04277 -0.97115 -1.553925 0.016529 -1.635061 -0.742368 1.067039 -0.975907 -0.624052 2.144466 0.213136 1.250515 0.30482 1.283266 0.096283 1.490643 -0.937467 -0.198321 -0.536791 -0.470169 -1.654466 0.178627 -1.498572 -1.466076 0.896355 1.06353 0.433491 -0.500783 0.757527 -1.542652 0.465022 0.111799 -1.086048 0.723478 -1.34699 0.185118 -0.54593 -0.42062 -0.256571 -0.41615 0.170071 0.127315 -1.066796 0.732402 -1.199035 0.965822 0.285163 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.122816 -1.119082 0.670529 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.027863 -0.422267 -0.614565 1.099083 -0.408772 -2.05115 4.583866 3.187159 4.730495 4.813005 5.202138,113
"so what do i think about for twenty minutes. i don't really know. it's different when you actually have to think about what you're thinking about. my feet are cold. which is so weird because my room is always hot! we really need to get that fan that we talked about. i wish i was home; i was always the right temperature at home. and if i wasn't i could just change it. oh well i'll be home at the end of this week. i hope steffie is feeling better and not having too hard of a time with classes. i haven't talked to nick since i've been gone; i wonder if he even misses me. probably not so much since he just started middle school and he is making all new friends. how come i haven't made all new friends? maybe i should have gone to a smaller college. i dunno, i just wish i wasn't here. seeing javi this weekend was great, but as much as i try to tell myself that i should be happy that i at least got to see him, i can't get rid of this hollow feeling. i think i've sighed in the past two and half weeks than i have in my entire life. but honestly, what will i tell mom and dad. i know that they support me but how am i going to say that after three weeks somewhere, i'm so unhappy and i just want to be somewhere else, preferably in oklahoma. i dunno, maybe i should just wait. it has only been three weeks, and you knew that you were a shy person. but eventually you'll start making friends like at home. i just wish i wasn't sad all the time. it makes me feel like i need to talk to dad about medicine again. i'm so sad. i hate it here. i just want to go back to normal. no matter what i do, like swimming the other day with jacob and alex. that was kinda cool, but i was still only mildly entertained. and as far as studying, i've always liked it, but now i depend on it way too much to keep me busy. oh yeah, i can't forget to go by the library today and ask for a job. if i don't get that done, it'll keep bothering me until i do. hopefully they'll have openings, because that would be the ideal place for me to work, i think. haha, everyone would laugh at me though. how perfect. christine, working in a library. whatever, it sounds cool to me. my birthday. i wonder if we're going to have time to celebrate it this weekend. i hope lee'or doesn't mind that i didn't call her. i should have called dee dee back so that i could wish lee'or good luck. oh well, she was getting married; i'm sure that she was so happy that she didn't even stop to think about it. i wonder what javi's doing right now. i 'm so glad he came this weekend. it was the best feeling. but then again, would it be worth it to change schools. i mean everyone is so pessimistic about this sort of stuff. should i even listen to them? i mean everyone said just break up before you leave. long distance doesn't work, but both javi and i ere so miserable. it caused more problems then staying together will. but i know what mom and dad would say. especially dad. he wants me to do well with business so badly. he is so proud. but i don't even want to do business! but then again, i dunno what exactly i want to do. except be with javi and start having some fun with this whole college"" experience that everyone raves about. so far, i'm a little disappointed. but i guess that's a little of my fault because all my motivation seems to have disappeared. except for good ol' school. at least i can judge that. i can't let them slip. my grades are what i can use to persuade my parents. that i at least tried the whole business thing, whatever. but now i'd rather do something interesting. ugh! business! yes, it's great. i got into ut business. wow! but if i can't even get excited about going to class, how am i going to get excited about getting up everyday of my life to do financial reports and stuff. oh blah! how boriiiinnngggg! how boring, how boring. but isn't that just perfect as well- i'm stuck between doing what i know is logically best and what i feel like doing. hmm, yeah, there are a lot of things on my mind. i always seemed a little stressed in high school. just trying to balance everything, but at least i had fun. i think if i were another person i probably wouldn't want to get to know me now either. despite the fact that i could get down before, i never doubted that overall, i was happy. now i just feel lonely. haha. maybe i should stop listening to coldplay. rush always said their music always makes someone sad. but i dunno, i really like the piano. and plus i have so many good memories from that one cd. i just need to listen to some more upbeat music i guess. maybe some ",0,-0.415659 0.206222 0.318115 0.125474 0.663285 -0.115228 -0.133131 -0.255198 -0.30518 1.007521 -0.216633 -0.268059 -1.031974 0.056285 -0.4307 0.0 -0.04277 0.373143 0.576391 -0.279984 0.53274 0.259346 -0.322499 -1.108615 0.537263 -1.675614 -0.544821 -0.480057 0.206389 0.255326 0.41901 0.052924 0.040387 -0.007436 -0.814309 1.325332 1.810275 0.579661 -0.257472 2.195334 0.189783 1.288343 0.402416 0.416048 -0.966708 1.512501 0.225763 -0.13869 0.659221 -0.088068 -0.984411 0.193318 0.322981 -0.116768 -0.478237 -1.280161 -1.152962 -0.496488 -0.894107 0.623876 -0.372037 1.006308 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 0.655901 -0.086094 0.563139 0.401784 -0.073676 1.562605 -0.210401 0.572345 -0.182624 -0.171161 0.953626 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.871411 5.002772 3.944287 5.145676 5.104826 4.570799,2001
"what do i write about? that is a good question, but i guess i should write about writing, or think about thinking. the thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued i am at the moment. i have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and i just want to sit and do nothing. i guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. jimmy buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. i wish i were sleeping and i wish i did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because i just want to do nothing right now. i don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. i did not have much class today, so i got to sleep in, but i could still use some rest. perhaps i need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. i just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. i have been in school here for about two weeks, and i think it is really quite a cool set up. you don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in psychology, only my other classes. the biggest adjustment i think from high school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. one of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. that guy is such a mess and i was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. it is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. i am trying to search for thoughts, but i just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. all of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville. "" i wish i were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. we have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around austin. but now my hands are kind of aching because i don't think i have ever typed this long without taking a break. i am certain that i wil have great stamina in my hands when i am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. it is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. i like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. i look up at the clock and see i am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. i feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which i have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. this writing is not so painful as i though because i was sure that i would just go braindead and have nothing to say. i do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. looks like i am out of time.

"stream of consciousness, i just ate breakfast and my stomach hurts, my stomach hurt when i got in my first accident two years ago. stupid car, i got in a wreck just recently i was going down the road and i came to a usual stop behind a car sat there for about 3 sec an the stupid ford ranger just came billowing into my rear end and crushed it, what are you looking for, would this be considered paranoia, why do you care so much about what i am thinking, i want to go home some times but to the home you see in movies, the ones with home cooked meals and clean rooms or even sofas to sleep on and it would be a good experience. i really want a dog, my do at home really sucks, she is old and acts like a cat, a robber came into our house a few years ago and the dog peed on itself the ran away, stupid dog. do you think i hold allot of hostility, i like to portray i don't care what anyone thinks, but that is not always true because some time to reach my goal i have to care a little bit, stupid hormones. you probably will not even read this so i guess it really does not matter exactly what i say. i wonder how long these things usually are, mine based on the amount of time i have spent writing will be four lines long, but those are some really long lines. i thing the guy next to me is hitting enter, so his is longer than mine. you know your class is too big it is hard to get any interaction so it gets boring. i tell my friend he has , he is not my friend, but i tell him he has no tact, but when i think about it neither do i and i grub with my money because i do not have much of it too spend i am 'a broke bitch!!' actually my lines are probably going to add up to about 3, but that is cool, the gut next to me has not written for 20 min, but hey jip the man, that is my motto, take as much as you can and get your moneys worth, i leave the lights on all the time in my dorm room because i want to waste electricity, and i leave the water running in the sink when i brush my teeth!! yeah jip the man. i really want a computer in my room and it is upsetting that i do not have one because i have had one all my life and i am supposed to start right now not having one what kind of cruel god designated the lot in my life for. i want to learn to hack into very large computer and take control of them, haha!! i will the most powerful man in the world, my and my delusions of grandure@idiot. com. what ever, i figured out that that could be take as an insult, doesn't surprise me though, people take to much to the heart these days! this girl i met she is a room mate of a friend of mine, but she is constantly telling people about her promissory ring and about her boy friend, but then after a party she messes around with my best friend, it is not that i am jealous of he so much that he got to mess around with her but the fact she did it at all, he gets some much action. i kind of respected her bitchiness, but then she had to go off and just go back on everything she said. dork. i am kind of jealous of the fact that joe messed, really broke her, that is kind of cool, and i wish i got to do it just for the reason of doing it. i really need to get a girl friend, i want some one i can rely on every once on in a while. beats the hell out of me, girls are too confusing. music can control my feelings, nin can send an adrenaline rush at me hard core. i drink too much when i drink. i do not drink all the time it is just when i do i drink too muck of it, so nothing can stop me now. i am out, this is cool i might do this again. later.

"okay well i have 20 minutes to write this paper well isn't that exciting. i believe i'm the worst speller and typer in the world. it seems like this is a really long page anyway i just wrote to my friend marissa who goes to southwest and i was going to write my friend jamie who i meet this summer at work but i was stupid and didn't get her email address of the letter she sent me and erased so now i can't write her, she probably thinks i'm the biggest bitch right now . i wonder if you all actually read these and analyze them . i want to go into criminal psychology because i think it sounds very interesting and believe it would be good for me when i try and get into the fbi i hope i can get into it. what if they turn me down. then i'll have worked all these years for it and gotten nothing from it . i think i will get in though . you know what i hate is when your hands get on the wrong keys on the key board and if your not watching you can write three sentence all messed up because of one little misplacement of the hand . i really hope you all don't read these because mine is kind of silly. anyway i slept for a long time today and i still feel tired i think if you sleep to much it makes you more tired, that's just my theory. it seems like i've been at this computer for ever because the note i wrote to my friend marissa was really long and i'm not that fast of a writer. when you stare at i computer screen real long it seems like your in a trance just like when you watch t. v. you just totally can veg out. a girl just poked her head in the door. i'm down in the computer lab right now because i don't have a computer and the one my room mate has doesn't have the ethernet set and she's hooked up to america on-line so i can't use my password to log on so i have to come down here. i really want a t. v. in my room. i know it is such a trivial thing but sometimes it's just nice to come home and relax and watch some t. v. noelle said she was going to get one before we came down but now she doesn't want to spend the money on it and my parents and i don't have the money so we are just stuck with out a t. v. it's okay though i'm sure it's better for me. the only thing is i don't know when anything is going on . i need to find out about the ani dafranco concert for jacob i just don't know who to ask or where to look. anyway about the t. v. i don't get a newspaper and the daily texan doesn't tell you every thing that's going on around the world. so a t. v. would be helpful so i could watch the news. well my mind just went blank and i have nothing to talk about. i love to people watch , it's cool to see the way different people act. that's why i think psychology would be interesting. i like to know how people tick. i hope me and shawnee stay best friends through out the year because i really want her to move down here next year, but when i went home last weekend i don't know if she had fun with me or not. oh well i won't worry about because what ever happens will happen. i'm sure it will all work out for the best what ever it is. my 20 minutes is up now so i'm going back to my room . so long.

"right now, i'm thinking about my physics lab and the fact that i did really poorly on that lab. i need to maintain a good gpa in order for me to get into the business school, and i don't want my lab grade to impede my admission. but even if i do get into the business school, do i really want to do something in that field? i mean i didn't declare a major at first because i didn't want to commit myself too soon to a field of study. i've always been interested in music. i do want to major in that but my parents aren't that fond of the field. so either i double major, which is impossible in the business school, or i don't do what i really want to do--that is major in music. no matter what i major in, i will have to maitain a very good gpa throughout college since i want to study abroad in england--the country where i've always wanted to live. mainly because of the fact that it is home to my favorite sport of all time--cricket. no one really knows about the sport here. i wish a lot more people did know about it so they could relate to the joy that i feel while watching the sport. i guess to enjoy a particular sport, or anything for that matter, u have to be born in that environment. back in pakistan, everyone loves the sport and it's like a religion. i sure do wish that pakistan had won the world cup in june. all that hard work went out the window when they played so poorly in the final. anyway, i hope to become a cricketer myself in the future. but that's not a career that is looked upon as being a good one. and the cricket board in pakistan is really a mess. a lot of good players are neglected because they don't have connections with members of the board. i have a cold and i've been sneezing since all day yesterday. god it's so painful to sneeze 24 hours a day. i took a dayquill last night but even dayquills seem to make me drowsy. now, on top of the sneezing, i have to deal with trying to stay awake in my classes. i'm waiting for my roommate to come so we can go eat. gosh i hate the food in jester. i mean it's the same old stuff everyday. at times like this, i really miss home and my mom's cooking. the weather over here today is pretty good. better than the previous month has been. i want to go play golf but i don't know where any of the golf courses are. i guess i'll ask my roommate's friend who plays golf.

"this is my writing i always feel like everything should have a title. somebody told me i was anal last night. i don't think so though. i've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. church always made us be nice to people. that's another thing, people always tell me that i'm ""like the nicest person i've ever met!"". i don't see it. i may be easygoing but i do not consider myself nice. i think i'm just not mean so people think i'm nice. i'm not. you should see how i treat the men in my life. the poor boys don't have a clue. marques hopefully will never find out because i actually do love him a lot but i just can't seem to settle down for anything. that's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. oh well, around this campus i think i am one of the only sane people around here. i'm saying that like i think i'm sane. i don't think i am. i like william a lot too. he's so strong and ""mr. cool"" like. i'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. i guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that i always go after big men. i can't believe marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. he is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that i have been dealing with lately. i hate typing. i don't have anything to say anymore. i wish i had a twinkie and a juice box. i do need to go to the grocery store. eckerds is just up the street though so i'll go up there if i can ever get caught up on all my work. i am going to try to make it to the delta party tonight. i think everybody's going to be there. i hope william is there. he's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. he gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. they look really bad and they kind of hurt too. oh well, at least i've found somebody that i like. i wish marques was here so that i could take my mind off of all these cute men. my nursing class is cool. are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. well, i don't think you want to get inside my mind. there's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. i guess everybody thinks like this though. i can't call myself different because sometimes i know that i am different. i don't think like everybody else i know. i think i'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think i am. okay, i have been typing for 12 minutes now. i told you that i don't have anything to say. it's not like i don't write in my journal every night. i know how my mind works and i don't particularly like it. i happen to think i'm a little nuts, but who isn't. this isn't all about me though. i'm not the teacher so i guess i just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. that's what i'm here for. my mom tries to make people happy too much. she had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. i thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. she's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. i wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. she's not. i love my daddy. he called while william was still in the bed this morning. not good. he kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but william plays too much anyway. i need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so i'll talk to you later.

"wow, this day has been hectic. i feel relieved that i got the math class i needed, finally. the people in the math dept. (at least sitting at the desk--- the ones i had, unfortunately, to deal with!) they were so rude and just did things at their own pace as if the students don't have classes or things to do. it was so annoying that the lady wouldn't let me fill out the permission form myself. i mean, i'm in college for god's sake! i can read and write and understand things pretty well. i think i can fill in the blanks for a unique # myself -- she wouldn't let me take it home since i hadn't decided which exact class of the 6 that i wanted. then i had to come back the next day and wait in the long line again and deal with the same rude lady. i know their jobs are tedious and boring, but i don't like having to deal with adding and dropping either. you know, i just want to do it on tex but i can't anymore! the biggest pain was all the running around i had to do for this and the frustration it gave me! i had to go to the professor's office find out his hours, then go to his hours the next day, sit in on class, find out that he doesn't accept late assignments and i've already missed 2 because of not being there, then trying to do the homework, getting the book, doing the homework, getting help from a friend, going back to the math dept. to find out if there was an opening in the class which there wasn't, going back at 8am to wait until they decided to open their doors around 8:45, find out the professor i wanted still doesn't have an opening and almost having to go through the whole process again, but the lady finally being nice to me and letting me go into another class and another professor without getting all the stuff signed. she said we were the last 5 people to get in and they had to take us so we didn't (thank g-d) have to go through it again. now lets just hope i can understand this professor and that maybe he'll let me make up the assignments i've missed. i used to like math, but at the moment i am very ticked off at he entire idea of math because of this whole ordeal. in every other aspect of the university, or in many of them but not really all, i feel like i matter and i am not just my ssn. but dealing with this i feel like i am just being pushed around and can't get what i want. i know i won't always be able to get the classes i want or the times i want, i didn't get exactly what i wanted even registering in the first orientation this summer, but i am definitely lucky in that i got almost what i wanted it seems to work out. i just feel so unimportant because of this math dept. lady who could care less about me and my problem. i really expected her to tell me i had to go through the whole procedure again. maybe she does have a heart since she didn't make me do it. i don't know. i just feel so, so small and belittled i guess. i don't know how to put it, i just feel bad in some strange way. other than that problem and a few others that i need to take care of, i am really doing well here. i really feel at home and that i belong here. coming from atlanta, ga and moving, i know i'd love it, but i tried not to get my hopes up too high so that if things didn't work exactly as i planned i wouldn't be disappointed. i guess it worked because i do have to deal with these few problems and another big one, but i am still loving it! i am so glad to be here! i really feel like i mad the right decision. i'm meeting so many people and some of them i've already become great friends with because they are already caring and helping me with my problems and i'm helping them too. i'm really making some great bonds here! i feel so loved! and they don't call me to go out because they feel badly for me or anything, i feel that they genuinely want to hang out with me. maybe that's just my perception but i really feel that way. and now i'm questioning myself, but i am serious and not just trying to make myself believe that. at least, i think so. but now i think i'm analyzing it all too deeply because i'm thinking -- but what if subconsciously i'm really just making myself believe that. i don't know. but i truly feel that it is a genuine feeling that i have that my friends are true friends for true reasons! ok. i think i'll stop here before i analyze every bit of this!

"so i'm not sure on what i'm supposed to be typing about. what i smell, taste, feel like??? well i'm chewing gum. i've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. i hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. my gum got hard a long time ago. but somehow the flavor is still intact. it's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. however, i've noticed that wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. there are many pictures on my wall. i stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. there are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. i don't have one of my family up there. i kind of feel bad in a way. but i don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. i have a picture of them in my drawer if i ever need to see them. but i think it's better with them in my drawer. every time i look up at these pictures of all my friends, i miss them like no other. man, i had so much fun last year, in high school in general. but last year was definitely the best year. man, me, caroline, and shaheen in government and spanish. those were some good times. i kind of even miss my teachers. and our elephants and doing scn all the time. we have so many inside jokes. and although i'm sure i'll see caroline again, i'm afraid that when i meet her things won't be the same. and for some reason i'm scared of that. i hope i can go to lsu in the spring. or actually, i hope caroline can come to houston for thanksgiving. or both would be the best. and we can't forget about going to europe next summer. i'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with xerx and zahra. but now with this whole separation thing, i know that our traveling days with the tegra family are over. those were some fun trips too. i feel so blessed to have a friend like xerx. and even zubin and stuff. people that i've known my whole life. that even know i don't see them too often, when i do, you can tell that there's something there. like i feel so close to them cause i practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. it's a really nice feeling. i'm also blessed for shenz and the whole family. god, shenz and fred really do care about me and tash like we were their own kids. and just knowing that really means a lot to me. and i hope that mom feels the same way about zareen cause that would only be fair. so we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and i'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. but i love the professor; we call him dr. eo. hahaha, he's really cool. like i walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" wow, i was like thinking ""what is this?"" oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. the office kind of reminds me of the the vinci code. i don't know why, maybe the whole ""louvre"" idea. i always say i hate france and stuff but i really don't. i just think it's kind of funny to say that. but i really don't know why it's funny. but i mean i've said it so many times now that i really think i've instilled the idea into my head. like i really don't want to travel to france in the summer. but i mean if caroline wants to, then i really don't care. i think i'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. like about my grades- i mean if i don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? i mean, i'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. but i mean if for whatever reason i don't, then i think i'll be ok. i mean, it's not like i'm going to die or anything. plus, if i have my own family then i don't think i'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. man, it's a complicated issue. we got a phone in our room, the same one i had in my room at home. but i haven't used it once here. if anything, jennifer has used it way more than me. man, i haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause i don't want them calling in case they call when i'm not here and then have to talk to jennifer. i'm not sure what i'm more afraid of, them talking to jennifer or jennifer talking to them. no, but jennifer's really cool. but so is joanna's roommate. man, i wish i had a roommate like her. dude, me and jennifer need to start hanging out more often. but i never want us to have the same friends. john is one of jennifer's friends. majoring in japanese and stuff. wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. i've always wanted to take some random language like japanese. i don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. like me learning a african language and spe ",0,-0.07024 -0.040438 0.708898 -0.003428 1.021471 -0.115089 -0.982533 -1.000433 -0.956185 1.276373 -0.184207 0.126864 -1.397639 -1.525872 -1.005701 0.0 -0.04277 0.260302 0.073789 0.961781 0.336853 0.344063 0.06215 -0.479859 -0.264187 -0.542127 -0.364564 -0.275167 -0.266441 0.536115 -0.394063 0.868116 -0.955144 -0.070667 -0.639319 -0.606362 -0.421424 -0.453611 0.083235 0.591461 -1.038726 -0.437556 0.392635 0.322759 -0.353886 0.409966 0.132932 0.483866 0.341035 0.381894 0.169805 -0.187173 -0.46843 -1.118388 -0.706271 -0.670537 0.042303 -0.954251 0.784907 0.182981 0.100664 -0.792456 0.42321 -0.471184 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.286063 0.567268 -0.073676 0.322479 0.500548 -0.37208 -0.049901 0.978354 2.079839 -0.451544 -0.408772 1.174987 5.108716 3.519311 5.06992 5.048177 4.67713,2462

" today i had a very busy day. at work i had to sort the payroll checks while my co-worker was on the phone and internet all day. i then quickly changed for school and i almost missed my bus. i have to ride the city bus to campus from work. i work downtown, not very far from campus. my first class today was chemistry. it seemed like the class wa never going to end. i learned quite a bit, but i was tired of taking notes. then i went to the gregory gym to work out. i did very good today and i didn't get tired very fast. i couldn't do my normal 30 minutes on the machine because others were waiting. i did start on the exercise equipment, trying to work out my legs and abs. i think i am going to be sore tomorrow. i really need to lose weight. i need to get skinny like all the girls on campus, so i can wear low cut jeans and tank tops. anyways, i am getting off the subject. after the exercise, i went to jester to get something to eat. i didn't realize the food was going to be processed. i don't know, it just wasn't what i expected. the pork chops were okay, but i was very hungry. i finished up my economics homework and went to class. i had to call and remind my husband to pick me up at 8:00pm tonight. when i got to my economics class, my professor didn't show up for class. what a loser. she preaches how we need to be in class on time and how every class is important, but this is already the second day she missed. you would think she would lead by example. well, what do you expect from a first year professor. and the thought that she can conduct experiments in a class that has more than 200 students. what a joke. i turned in my lab report, it was really difficult, but i think i did a very good job. i am proud of my lab report, i hope i get a good grade. i met this girl in my class today. i am not sure what her name is, but she was really nice. she is from dallas. but when i told her i was married and had a daughter, she kind of freaked. well, she didn't ignore me or anything, but she stopped talking to me as much and she gave her number to the girl sitting on the other side of her. am i not good enough to giver her number to? because i have a husband and a daugher. well, who cares, her loss. i am going to do really well in this class and she is going to be lost! that is why i don't talk to anyone on campus. i just don't want to get close to anyone. that would mean i would have to entertain them or call them, or they might even try to use me. make me do all the work and they get a free ride. i am going to do really good this semester. of course, i am going to make the connections i need to bring up my grade. you know, go to office hours, si sessions, ask questions. meet people who really want to study or just ask a quick homework question to. see, i like that kind of a friendship. someone who can help me on something i can't work out on my own, then not want me to spend time with them. maybe i just think of this as high school and its not. i am pretty sure everyone else is here to get their educaiton and get out, not to make friends. well, after economics class, i went to the si session for psychology. now this is going to be a hard class. there is just not enough time to study. i want to spend more time studying, but i can't. i try to make room for studying at home, but my daughter makes it really difficult. i wish i would have finished school before i had my daughter. i can't even tell you what i did with my time before her. i really do hope that after i complete school, if i do, that i will be more financially stable. i hope that all this struggling and time away from my family will be worth it. i really hope i made the right decision to put us in debt over student loans for my education. i really want a college diploma. i really wish i wasn't a loser and i could get into the school of business. but, i have accepted that i will not. but once i get my economics degree and i become a cpa, that we will reek the benefits. i want a big beautiful house and i want to be able to pay off our credit cards and save money. i don't think that i am asking for much, but i guess everyone wants these things. more about my day, during my pschology session, i noticed that i really don't know much about the material. i really need to get to studying the chapters. i hear the tests are really hard. pennebaker seems like a really good professor. he makes us laugh and makes me listen and not fall asleep, but he also gives us a lot of information. (i am getting tired of typing. my hands hurt, but i like the practice in typing) i want a lap top. i really think that if i get a lap top that i can get a lot accomplished during my study time. i could go to the library and type and not have to wait to use one of their computers. i can't even use our computer at home because my daughter gets in the way. alex, my husband, doesn't pay any attention to her when i am there. it makes me wonder how they are when i am not around. i bet he is on the computer downloading music and she is in the living room getting into all sorts of things. my things. or she is sitting in the other living room watching shrek.

"a writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as i sit here i can remember all the papers that i have written. i usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what i have written before i continue. i can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. right now i'm thinking about where i need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. i wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. i looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. today is in fact my second day of school at the university of texas. i was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. now, i'm more worried that i won't be able to succeed like i did in high school. maybe i'm not so worried that i won't do well; i'm worried that it will be very hard and that i won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. well, i'm not a chemistry major, but i am a biochemistry major, so now i'm worried that i'm in the wrong class. i've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure i'm eligible for the class, and it appears that i am. maybe i just shouldn't worry. i also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. i'm basically a good student, and i usually don't disrupt the class. sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. i guess its not really a big deal, but i don't like getting in trouble. i'm one of those people who likes to do things i'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once i suspect that someone might find out, i'll try to get everyone else to stop. i know it is kind of hypocritical, but i just don't like to get in trouble. the words i dreaded most growing up were ""lisa, we need to talk. "" whenever my mother said that to me, i just knew i had to be in trouble. i would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what i did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. usually, it turned out to be nothing. i guess sometimes i worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. about a month before going to college, i spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. i guess i wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but i was crying about everything. it even made me upset that i didn't have my computer yet, and i wasn't leaving for college for another month. i just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how i wanted it to. plus i had a lot of things to do in august, and i didn't want to run out of time. it did work out, but i still became upset about it. i moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. for the past couple of years, i've told everyone that i want to be a doctor. now i'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. i can't even begin to imagine the debt that i will incur by trying to become a doctor. that made me want to look into other careers, but i don't like a lot of other things. maybe i can wait until i graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. i like to worry about everything. what i really like to do though, is to make lists. i love buying planners because i always write down my assignments. and i write what i have to do on thursday and if i don't finish that day, i write it again on friday to make sure i do it. i'm not that concerned if i don't complete my tasks, but i just want to make a list. my roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. i have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and i want to have music playing. it wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. i understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. i guess i'm just used to studying if i need to in order to do well. i just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time.

"the first thought that enters my mind is that i have no idea what i am going to say in this assignment. i have no thoughts or feelings except that i am trying to think about what to say. these types of assignments are difficult for me because i usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. because i am a guy, sex just popped into my head. because i am male, i hope i do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. for the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings i will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. this being my first college writing assignment, i am a little nervous that i may be doing this wrong. i must change my previous statement that i am confused. it is more of a fear that i will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. my next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time i had left. only fourteen minutes left. yahoo. i just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. it is not that i like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at gregory for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. i can't wait). i just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. this is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. i just saw an empty dr. pepper can in the garbage can and i thought i might like one, but then i realized that i wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. my next thought was that i wish i had a thesaurus right now because i have used the word ""assignment"" too many times. excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. it was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because i believe he might go ""postal"" at anytime. i had a thought before this person came to the door, but i forgot it now. it's okay because i only have to write for seven more minutes. i am wondering what my ""quote of the day"" will be on my board outside my dorm. i want to use a quote from the movie ""what about bob"" but i'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. again, i am having the problem of not knowing what to say. it must stem from my lack of self-esteem. i just glanced at the clock and found that i only have to write for two more minutes. i just realized that i should not have written that down because i could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences. if this ""assignment"" was supposed to show me how my mind works, i am not pleased with the results. it shows me that my mind does not work that well at all. my only ""sensation"" in the last twenty minutes is that i have to go to the bathroom ",0,0.585706 -0.987741 0.562584 -1.405431 -2.072155 -0.783091 0.921504 0.530498 -0.182222 -0.42762 -0.124323 -0.590446 -0.238404 1.435213 2.302156 0.0 -0.04277 -0.532557 0.388391 -0.795527 0.195554 -0.182077 -1.346169 1.843199 0.025509 0.977393 0.441993 0.743724 -1.296436 -1.624919 -1.100231 -1.015919 -0.099161 2.109641 -1.017959 -0.655399 1.780013 2.012912 1.633219 -0.096287 0.335563 0.55286 -1.76917 -0.05878 0.51202 -0.261018 0.013361 -1.487619 -0.518787 -1.506962 -0.434381 0.597591 0.985643 -0.458266 2.144983 -1.001723 -0.168886 1.350122 -0.476952 0.27348 -0.361378 0.222199 -0.480161 -0.250598 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.319312 0.030222 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.0779 4.633999 -1.137 0.649706 -0.083432 -0.322413 4.054271 4.836233 4.17779 4.618113 4.308118,711
"i don't know what just happened, but all that i just wrote for the last 10 minutes just got erased. this makes me a little perturbed, but i don't really care. this just allows me to write even more interesting things. maybe this time i'll talk about movies. yeah those bad ass little things that i l0ove ohhhhh sooo much. in fact i'm hoping to film a movie by this years oklahoma game. that way i can show my best friend who will join us from k. c. together we made 6 movies. 4 movies for english and two for our own enjoyment. okay the preview for scream2 is on the tv behind me and its a little hard to pay attention to this assignment, but i guess this is also part of the assignment. how many people does it take to rip off a football from the bumper a of a frog. jello. jello. retard. bug women can kick my friend's ass. at least that is what he always says. he says that he is going to start going after those women who could actually kick his ass. me i'm just going after the beautiful intelligent type. it seems like it is working out thus far, but not from m shoes. 4 women are in my life right now. one is an ex-girlfriend who i was very attracted to, but broke up with me for seemingly no reason whatsoever. i think it was because i became too attached, whatever that means. i guess loving someone too much is not a good thing. that was sarcasm. i really don't think there is such thing as loving someone too much. i do sometimes watch myself when i'm trying to meet a girl. now i wonder if they think i'm trying too hard. anyway, my ex gave me a call and we talked for 2 hours. in the talk i felt like going over there and hugging her right there, but she would be missing out on sleep for her next day. i think she valued her sleep more than me. well no not really, i think we just weren't mature enough to know how we really felt. i still can't really say whether it was true love since i have never had any other taste of love that i could compare it to. al i know is that i miss what we had, and i want it back. i thought i was over it. he's 30. i am over it. today i realized that life is not as complicated as we all make it out to be. it this ""real world"" that we have made up that keeps us under constant stress. the mind analyzes everything and tries to figure out the real world. it is the heart that i try to follow. the heart gets past all that which seems and goes straight to what feels right. i believe in that feeling over the appearance of a situation. i have led a very happy life and i think i am doing things right. i jus t recently had to decide whether or not i wanted to be a frat guy. isn't it funny that i brought this up right after i mentioned i think i'm doing things right. i take that as a good sign. but now i'm hesitating so i take that as a bad sign. basically i'm still trying to figure out whether i turned down the frat for personal reason or to please other people. when i did decide to quit the frat i became extremely happy, almost to the point of crying in my car. this was when i came up with this decision on my own outside the influence of the other people i know. then the damn frat got me to come into their house and talk to me one on one. this showed me all the people that i would be letting down by not joining the frat. i can't stand letting people down. i try so hard to help everyone, but its just impossible. i think the reason i felt like an asshole yesterday was because i have let a lot of people down the beginning of this year. namely the frat and my brother for not joining the frat like he did. he is trying to live vicariously through me and it is a little annoying. i think i first showed interest in the frat just for his sake. i would like to explain to my brother that we are not alike and that my whole life is not revolved around women and beer, but anytime you talk to m brother he just makes you look stupid and i hate that. i don't feel like i can explain anything to him unless he already believed it to begin with. i think this is why he became a lawyer.

"sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing. there's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 20 minutes and try and make it completely coherent. the music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling. then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue. adversaries in between as if rapids in the path. the sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky. now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest. the light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside. i watch my friends sit next to me. one is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm, the other sits and types quietly. the music is quieter now with bell like rings in it. the bass has a slow but progressive sound to it. the guitar sings about as the music moves on. over the middle window, the one with the blinds shut, we keep the blue mask. it has sharp looking teeth which are yellow. the teeth match the horns. i'm now half past the time of when i started. some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs. sorry for the time of which i slacked. i loosing ideas of what to write now. i have little more to to tell of my surroundings more. the music is now more of a popping sounds. it also mud like sounding guitar now. my phone is ringing now but i got my friend to pick it up. i will call them back. this is now the end.

"trying to talk to my friends on the computer but i have to do this writing assignment. at least its easy, right? oh well. i was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am i going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. i really like this new piebald cd. its happy. i hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. i think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. i have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. i wonder if i say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. i need to read more. especially for school. i just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. i'm tired, i should go to sleep. but i know i won't and i probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, i should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily i suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no ",1,0.256821 -1.948319 -0.845444 -2.128758 -1.683466 -1.898478 0.8226 0.37989 0.570297 -1.090284 -0.214641 1.402082 0.357463 -0.299938 0.439553 0.0 -0.04277 -1.698958 -1.462707 -0.375753 -1.644457 -0.334552 -1.116917 2.628192 0.321533 -1.134729 0.430138 -0.78802 1.197048 -0.375437 0.13679 2.193637 2.172514 -0.174362 0.474415 -1.109326 0.103314 1.148078 -0.939189 -0.094296 -1.038726 1.416756 -1.6344 -0.131809 -0.298984 0.789488 -1.093488 -1.089163 -0.305036 -0.90016 -0.018478 -0.809419 -1.396934 0.322107 0.538703 0.227881 0.24773 -0.954251 0.378161 1.082139 -0.407968 -0.00844 0.311073 -0.745201 0.885454 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.34954 0.665873 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.819145 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.73527 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.213766 4.331446 4.097173 3.716587 4.27894 4.595335,2134
"in the past i have always had a set of instructions to follow. on well, here goes. i guess that right now i was back, at the beginning of summer, sitting in my room in el paso, texas. this summer was really good. i got to go home and talk with my friends. in addition, i was able to do work and get my history requirement fulfilled. everyone wants me to go out and get a job. that's okay with me, but i don't really know how to go about getting a good job. you see, i feel that with almost 60 hrs of credit, i should be able to get a decent job. one guy i know is making over 50,000, and he isn't even out of college. i guess it's just easier for some people and not for others. i promised everyone that i would get an internship with a company next summer. that's kind of cool, but it is going to be a completely new experience. i guess i could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if i could get a job with them, but that just wouldn't be good. i want to be able to say, ""here is what i did, and i did it all by myself. "" i know that it's natural to want to get out from under your parent's wing, but it just seems to me that it takes forever. i have been blessed, though. i have done well in school, and fortunately i have a comfortable place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. sometimes it bothers me that i am more preoccupied with which movie i am going to go see this weekend than with more substantive subjects. there are people in this earth who can't even find enough to eat. wow, this is really getting deep. i don't want this to become a ""dear abby"" kind of assignment, so i guess the best thing to do is to change the subject. i am mildly interested in why this assignment was assigned. i have a certain hesitation when i deal with psychologists and people who are interested in psychology because i always feel like everything i do or say is being evaluated, and that bothers me. well, i can hear my neighbors (they just turned up their stereo system. )back to the subject at hand. i am not nearly so stressed this semester like i was last year. i guess that's pretty cool because i am adjusting to the whole college thing pretty well. at least now i know what is going on with this school, this city, and everything else in my life. i by no means have everything figured out, but at least i am not as clueless as i was last year. it is interesting to look around and see the freshman, with the look of panic in their eyes and realize that i was in the exact same predicament a year ago. since the brother of a friend of mine just moved to austin and started attending graduate school in engineering, i feel a certain obligation to help him. it is awful to be in the exact same situation without anyone to help. anyway, the guy is really cool, and i think that a really good friendship will develop. friendship is something that there is never enough of. money can't buy good friends, and even though people will try to replace friends with artificial benefits, it just never works. i used to know a man who had loads of money. this guy was really wealthy, but he was never happy. however, if you ever asked him how he was doing, he would never admit that he was unhappy. i guess that is really sad. to be miserable is one thing, but to be miserable and not really know it is something completely different. i think that it is possible to elevate your situation if you are miserable, but i also believe that it constitutes knowing that you are miserable. rrahhh, my neighbors just turned down their stereo system. thank god for the little things! i don't really understand why people are always claiming they are depressed. i've been through periods when i feel down, but all i ever do is call my friends, turn on the television to a program i like, go work out, or a host of other things to elevate that situation. i don't believe that 10% of americans need to be on prozac, or some other drug which makes you feel better. oh, well. i guess the only thing that i can do is change my own destiny. even though it scares me, it is kind of cool. i see so many people who are in a rut, and it makes me feel like their lives are hopeless. i know that changing is hard. i don't really like to change. however, it always seems that when i do, it is for the better. of course, there are those times when you change, and it proves to be a change for the worse. that only goes to reinforce your opinion that changing is wrong and you shouldn't do it. i believe that a person should experience all the things life has to offer at least once. that way they can say that they've done it. in addition, they'll know what it is. you know, i always feel awkward when i am in a conversation that turns stale. (i. e. the kind of conversation where no one really knows what to say. ) that really is bad. it seems like i have been in too many of those type of situations. i don't really know what the future has in store for me, but i am both excited and apprehensive. it is easy to look back on my past and think that those days were the glory days when everything was easy. unfortunately, those days proved to be no different than today. is that the way it always is? your memory improves memories as time goes on? if so, i can understand how the past was so alluring and appealing to many people. i know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is. that's pretty sad. i think that they need to start living today for what it is worth. that's what i try to do. i guess my 20 minutes are up. this was kind of an interesting experiment, but i am not entirely sure what the results are. i don't really know myself, and i don't know if it is possible to know yourself. there are so many different facets and sides to me that it would drive a person crazy to try to document them. i can't even do it.

"i am in my dorm room in jester west staring at the keyboard. my friend's dad just bought me a new dell computer because mine was so old that it would not recognize ethernet because the technology is too new. i am listening to an allman brothers band cd that i downloaded and it's pretty good. i don't know if i'm doing this right but i guess i am because i'm just typing what i'm thinking. i had to wake up at 8 this morning for a ta session for calculus which was of no help at all. she gave us the easiest problems ever and the class ran late so i had to walk into my biology class after it had started. it seems in math the teacher always explains things that are so easy and when u get to the homework u find that its nothing like class at all. i am noticing crumbs on my keyboard from the new flavor blasted goldfish extra cheddar i sampled some in the campus store and they were so good that i bought them. ok now it is getting hard to type bc i keep thinking too hard i think. i am now downloading the movie super troopers. the very first thing that i downloaded after getting my computer was the movie yellow submarine. i love having kazaa because i never have to buy cds or dvds ever again. i have an hour until my next class which just so happens to be psy. after that i think i am going shopping because my dad's wife just sent me 100 dollars for a graduation present. my sister is iming me right now. she had an away message about how mondays suck or something so i told her to think about pollyanna haha i thought it was funny. my roommate went outside to study because our room is like 20 degrees below zero at all times. i like my roommate but she is one of those overly caring people. i feel so bad saying anything mean about her though because it seems like i inconvenience her more than she does me. well maybe not i don't know. i thought that the university would match roommates according to their time schedules and interests. haha it was kind of funny because i was just assuming that my roommate was going to be a person who listened to the same kind of music that i do because that was one of the questions that you had to answer. well she does not and she only has like 5 cds and they are probably the worst ever, well maybe not but avril levine is one of them which indicates a total lack of good taste in music for her part. it always makes me wonder when people are really smart but they like dumb things like she has serendipity. i am a big john cusak fan but that movie was awful everything they said sounded so practiced and forced it was disappointing, and i probably spelled that wrong i can never remember if there are 2 s's of 2 ps and maybe there are 2 of both i don't know i guess ill look it up after i am finished with this. which i almost am i have less than one minute left woo hoo no i'm just kidding, this wasn't too bad and i got to practice my typing. i can type pretty fast but i look at the keyboard and i ",0,0.239512 -0.231438 -0.551923 -0.326932 -0.369248 -1.200037 0.340689 0.377711 0.279477 -0.276154 -0.034482 -0.590446 0.234307 -0.145687 0.914803 0.0 -0.04277 0.31549 0.078758 -0.257319 0.013802 -0.48093 0.54857 1.024291 -0.017868 -0.167972 -0.886391 0.762883 -0.576982 -0.05346 -0.703724 -0.656368 -0.764669 -0.906028 -0.38015 -0.685711 -0.513681 1.171266 0.1783 -1.11568 -1.038726 0.471049 0.142916 -0.608873 -0.704774 0.251421 -0.749176 0.414655 0.364099 0.113524 -0.495323 0.343091 1.242007 -0.734214 -1.221986 -0.96396 -0.907569 1.913072 -0.837931 0.1666 -0.712316 -1.260006 -0.480161 -0.283627 0.371361 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.866849 -1.120517 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.470171 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.501602 4.745736 3.828929 4.522864 4.792444 4.661071,2012
". i never thought it would be this hard to think about my stream of consciousness. now that i am aware that i am actually thinking to myself, it makes it really difficult to think normally. i keep giving myself all these weird things to write about but really none of them are really representational of the real way i think. my thoughts are usually random and irrelevant to anything going on around me. you could say i daydream often. i really wish that i were doing this in a quiet room because the things going on around me are effecting what i want to type about. julie, my roommate, is usually in the library so i guess i should have taken advantage of that earlier and done this assignment then. my attention span is short. i keep finding myself drawn into her conversation. it makes me think about talking to my friends on the phone, which eventually leads to me reminiscing about some past event involving my friends. the funny thing about my situation now, is that only actual people talking, interrupts my thought process. the television doesn't disturb me at all. i have gotten very good at tuning it out. maybe its because i have made it a habit of doing just about everything with the television on, including sleeping. i am growing impatient with the time now. it seems like 20 minutes has gone by, but when i check my clock it always reads the same. time always passes slowly when you grow anxious for a certain amount of it to pass. this assignment is difficult for me. i am really having trouble recording my natural thought process instead of just making these random thoughts up for the sake of using up my 20 minutes. i just keep looking around my room hoping that it will spark some thought and give me something more to write about instead of this meaningless rambling. i don't know, my mind is blank now; i am pretty much out of time, so i think i will end on this statement.

" i feel as if my life revolves around a world full of unanswerable questions. i cannot seem to find what it is that i want out of life. there are so many options and turns where i can easily decide to follow, but i am so inconsistent of what i truly feel passionate about. i wake up in the morning and step outside of my dormitory daily smelling the fresh air. everyday it seems as if there is something i have not witnessed before. i need answers to my life. i am a person that does not go through the day easily without understanding why things are the way they are. i am a first year student at the university of texas and i have been bombarded with hundreds of organizations and choices that will lead me somewhere in the next few years. not only academically has this burden faced me straight on, but i am confused about a girl i have met as well. as with the hundreds of organizations, there are hundreds of girls i see in and out of my classes. do i really want a relationship so soon? and further, can i handle a girl that is apart of the greek system knowing that i will never have a desire in joining one in the future? it is so hard to choose a path when you analyze your choices to death. for instance, if i decide to discontinue dating this wonderful girl just because i will not be able to tolerate her constant consumption of alcohol and nightly partying with other fraternity guys, will this decision have been the most appropriate one? or is it possible i may be a bit too judgemental of her capabilities of being a loyal girlfriend? in addition to my social life, i have to maintain some arbitrary schedule which will be beneficial for my personal needs. like many others, i have been set loose from the world i used to know and i am on a path where i control my line of travel. it is realistic yet frightening at the same time. all my life, choices have been easy. and if i was faced with an extenuating circumstance then i always had the parental feedback to support my decision. i am creating a life. it is not just any life; it is mine. i am on my own. i have waited for this moment for a long time. and now, i do not know what to do with it. is this normal? have i overlooked something? is it humanely possible to beg and plead for an entity such as freedom and once it has been acquired to not desire its power as much? i am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet to come. i hope i am joining the right organizations that appeal to me. i also hope i will stay academically strong as i was in high school. and further, i hope i will have made the right choice with the girl i met. i have faith that i will be led in the right direction.

"today is the friday before labor day. my boyfriend is picking me up and we are going to drive back to houston. i am excited about going home. my suite mate is also going home this weekend. that is fun. her parents don't want her to come back so soon. in one way i don't really want to go home either. i am going because i will get to spend time with my boyfriend. his name is jonathan-by the way. my room mate is sleeping. i kinda feel bad about typing while she is sleeping, but i have things i need to get done. one of those things involves typing. she has been really mood lately as far as people being quite. she needs to understand that living with three people is hard. i have flower from bambi on my desk. i got her from my boyfriend. i collected all of the mcdonald's toys. i had all the characters from bambi except flower. i don't remember why i mentioned that to him, but he went to an antique store and found flower! it was really sweet. he gave it to me when i was sick. we have a really good relationship. it is really hard being away from him. we have only been dating for three months, but we have spent every hour of every day of those three months together. there was only one day we spent apart. he went to his dad's house. he went there early in the morning. i was really tired that day. i don't remember what i did but i was tired after. it was a long day with out him. i think my friends started to feel neglected because i was spending so much time with jonathan. most of them understood. i did make time for them-but just not as much time as i was spending with them before jonathan and i were together. my friend jessica and i got into a big fight because i was spending so much time with jonathan. that was part of the problem. the other part of it was that she stopped taking her prozac. bad move. she really upset me. we going in a fight at 3rd period and i was crying at 4th. i went to talk to a friend of both mine and jessica's about the situation. jessica showed up and started yelling at me even more. i was none too happy. lauren told me that jess was under alot of stress because of family problems and other things. i didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me. jonathan was my first real boyfriend. jess has gone through many. i am always happy and supportive of them and her relationships. for once i wish she could do the same for me. it has all worked out now and jessica and i have talked. we are friends again. that is good. i hate it when people are mad at me. i do not do well with enemies. my mommy always taught me to never make enemies. i still call my mom mommy. i don't know why. it is just one of those things. one of shoshana's friends would tease me about that. that's ok. i'm well over that! i have my next class at 2-3. i don't know what i will do until then. i think i might do some of my work-but that is not likely. i think i will return some e-mail and stare at the walls. i'm good at that! it's my hobby, next to sleeping! until next time i have to type-i think i will go now!

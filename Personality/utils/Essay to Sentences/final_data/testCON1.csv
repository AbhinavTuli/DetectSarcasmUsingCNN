"last saturday , my parents sold the house that i have lived in my entire life .","even though it has been on the market for over a year , i was very upset .",it seems to me as though my family is falling apart .,"i have three siblings , and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities .","and since the place that my parents are moving to does n't have rooms for us , where i am right now is my home now .","where my brothers and sister live is their home now , and it does n't feel like we are a family anymore .",because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically .,"even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown , amarillo , we could n't .","there are six of us in my family , and my parents only have one extra bedroom .","my sister only has one extra bedroom , so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent 's when we are in amarillo .",it 's so weird .,i do n't even know what i 'm going to do when i drive past the house .,i 'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking .,i do things like that all the time .,"without thinking , one day , i drove to my best friend 's house because i was thinking of her , and she was n't even in town .",i just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want .,"they are so excited about simplifying their lives , but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof .","my family is the most important thing in my life , and i do n't want that to change .",i guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings .,"they were close friends with their siblings , and now they barely talk to each other .","now that my siblings and i are beginning to make families of our own , i do n't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now .","i 've gone through life making friends and growing apart , and it has been really hard on me , but my family has always been there .","without that solid relationship , i do n't know how life is going to be .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.466982 -1.302153 0.519387 -0.812196 -1.273109 1.826872 0.239808 0.433127 0.217811 -0.988044 -0.101982 -0.590446 0.096687 0.348703 0.032552 0.0 -0.04277 0.351588 -0.344378 3.91084 0.689812 -0.742368 0.165133 -0.170355 -0.624052 -0.55495 -0.005206 0.581137 -2.149562 -1.962682 -1.100231 -0.866488 -0.974289 0.461173 -1.017959 -0.491941 -1.258204 -0.313797 -0.306889 -1.086867 -1.038726 -0.521722 0.348388 -1.691813 -0.901394 -1.106866 -0.59168 1.691629 -1.110964 1.167455 -1.34699 -0.103435 -0.092622 0.280393 -0.654435 0.526809 -0.351221 0.090473 0.985145 0.000795 0.922721 -0.608714 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.426972 0.888185 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.373517 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.047527 5.179968 4.182416 5.266035 4.848924 4.094924,1114
i 'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind .,this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote to the lighthouse and mrs. dalloway .,her name will come to me in just a second .,she was a very depressed person i still ca n't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die .,"oh well , i ca n't remember her name write now .",it is strange that i ca n't remember her name considering i read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work .,i think i ca n't remember because i feel too much stress the remember it .,"in fact , i feel like right when i stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head .",i can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head .,ok i am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what i read earlier today from c. s. lewis ' mere christianity .,it is amazing how much i am learning about the christian faith and i have been a christian for a while now .,i like what lewis says about society and morality .,how what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men .,no matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion .,well i think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id .,i will vehemently oppose such a measure .,it is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than i can write .,so while i 'm in the middle of writing this sentence i have already thought of 2 other things .,i am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics .,"to get to such high positions of power , one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but i wonder if that is really true i wonder if there can be honest politicians i wonder if there can be honest lawyers .",i surely hope so you know i remember reading one that diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day .,i wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has i still ca n't believe she is dead you know i feel like i am kind of censoring what i write because of the possibility that so ta might,what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it .,i think i probably would if i were a ta it must be really difficult to be a ta and be a grad student .,it is hard enough just being an undergrad student .,my head kind of hurts right now i wonder if that is from stress i think it is .,my apartment is quiet right now i am very glad i did n't go out with my roommates i like being by myself every once and a while .,i love not having to worry about any body but myself but i also love being around people .,i really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together i guess everything has its ups and downs even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on tuesday and thursday,instead of on mwf i 'm really now to nervous right now but i am sure i will get stressed out this semester i really need to learn how to deal with my stress .,if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit .,ok i only have to write for a couple more minutes .,it is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about it seems like i think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever i have quite time to myself i wonder why that is i am excited about this psychology class .,learning about human behavior is always interesting to me i think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- i guess sort of a power issue i hope that now why i am interested in psychology ., , , , , , , , , , , ,

as i 'm sitting here at my computer i 'm thinking about how bad i started off this semester .,i know that i should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier .,plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule .,"causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking , but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses .",i 'm also thinking how tired i am from staying up all night studying .,"in the back of my mind i 'm hoping to get this work study job so that i can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school , considering how i took",12 hours and worked this summer .,i keep smelling my cologne ( ck1 ) that i accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning .,a lot more came out then i expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else .,had i not been so tired maybe i would have realized that i only needed a couple of drops .,"not to mention everywhere i have went today people either say , someone put on to much cologne , or , you smell good .",i 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time .,i 'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner .,my brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work i need to do .,i 'm homesick already .,i miss my family and i have only been here a couple of weeks .,i did n't expect this my sophomore year .,i thought it only happened to freshmen .,i feel really hungry too .,i have n't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal .,i feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at gregory .,i 'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team .,but with my luck they wo n't have tryouts for the second year in a row .,i wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges .,i wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as i did .,probably not because they all play sports .,i think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you do n't you wo n't play .,i think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes .,they think they have it easy and that they get free grades .,they do n't .,they have a job .,there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired .,"while fighting through the daily soreness and injuries , they have to try to get school work done .",i think that is tough .,i have sympathy for them .,i hope that i can get everything done today that needs to be done and also i plan on changing my shirt before this ck1 gives me a headache .,i probably will never wear ck1 again .,i hope all my friends and family are doing well .,"i plan to get some good sleep tonight also , of course after all my work is done .",time is running out so bye ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.611486 -0.227978 0.256428 0.275006 -0.022939 -0.62355 1.034395 0.02234 0.140641 -0.329167 -0.146864 -0.590446 0.364822 1.004728 1.298389 0.0 -0.04277 0.008848 0.393298 -0.795527 0.200731 1.131494 -0.20545 0.506207 -0.624052 0.158279 0.41881 -0.444244 -0.257713 0.345662 -1.100231 2.137875 -0.734664 -0.425755 -0.691423 0.191933 0.249207 0.658673 0.242735 0.087173 -1.038726 -0.325798 0.760915 0.225316 -0.68743 -0.624148 0.669271 -0.296578 -0.0801 -0.025654 -0.765624 0.185424 0.61016 -0.115435 0.014315 0.176796 0.989605 0.51372 1.129611 -0.303985 -1.185737 2.927352 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.051902 -0.781474 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.23575 0.600762 -0.097892 -0.696663 4.829517 3.854212 4.295284 4.815995 4.241127,2159

"as i start my third semester at ut , i feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once .","first of all , i 'm excited because this is probably the first semester that i feel truly comfortable with my life here .",i am living with my sister which is so good for me .,we get along really well and i really enjoy spending as much time with her as i can .,"also , my exboyfriend is at ut with me now .",he is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now .,but fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year ( because he was still in high school ) was good for me as well .,it enabled me to find out who i was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at ut .,"because of our time apart , i made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him .","so , this year , i not only have him with me , but i also have all the friends that i made last year so that i do n't depend only on him .","my best friend , unfortunately is not in such a good situation .","her boyfriend came to ut this year as well , but because he was away from her last year , she spent very little time at ut meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city .",she spent most of her time in houston visiting him .,"as a result , this year , she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people .","although , i know that she 's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her , i realize that if something happens to her relationship with him , she will be left with very few friends to turn to .","since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships , i fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him .",she barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him .,"but i try to hold this against her because i know that she is not trying to ignore me , but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend .","but other than that , i 'm really happy with my social situation right now .","it is a really good thing that i have this support of all my friends at this time , because i realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career .",i am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class .,"three of these classes involves building models , drawing orthographics , and designing .",two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers .,"in the first week , i already am swamped .","although i know myself well enough to know that i will definitely finish all my projects , somehow i still stress out about them a bit , just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters i will have to pull ( especially",when i think of the fact that i have 8:00 classes every day of the week !,) .,and i would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that i will have to build because i know how expensive they get .,"but , i realize that with the huge load i have so far , working is almost impossible for me .","if i could have my way though , i would work at a restaurant in town .",i worked at pappasito 's over the summer and i really loved waiting tables .,i met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them .,i think the reason i loved it so much was definitely because of all the people i met .,there were mostly guys that i worked with and they were all so friendly to me .,we would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work .,i got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure .,it was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me .,it gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

last night was pretty good and all .,i was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it .,"but who can blame the guy , weslaco is n't exactly the place one would want to be .","i just feel bad for junior , he feels totally alone and stuff .","javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all , but junior never talks to javi because he does n't like what javi does on his spare time , so because of that , he does n't talk to him as much .","i was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk , i miss that guy a lot , i just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something .","he is n't working or going to school , hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning .",all i could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself .,hopefully he 'll be here in austin visiting soon .,"speaking of getting off your ass , i need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating .","high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through ( a walk in the park ) but college is n't the same , needless to say .","dad said this is the rest of my life i 'm preparing for , and there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because i 'm being lazy .","i miss dad , and mom and everyone else .","yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we 're family , only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it .","much like me and my friends , because friends are family too , even knowing more about you than you might through observation .","regardless , i love austin , its a great town , there is so much to do , and a lot of time to do it in , but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation , because too much of a good thing can",be bad for you .,"i hope grandma is ok , i miss waking up and telling her `` buenos dias , como manecio

probably feeling .,"she just had a kid , her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with , and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her , as well as the threats , in order to get her","to tell them the information they believe she has , but which in fact she does n't .","because no matter how bad the news , she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother would know , because she is like my oldest sister , and she is probably the closest cousin that i may have .","damn , i miss georgie .",stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it .,procrastinator in the making just like me .,"i miss listening to my punk and ska with him , he was the only person that liked it as much as i did , and i didnt even force him to like it .","funny now though , in austin one would say that its a bit `` trendy '' to like this music , but in weslaco .",its not really known .,and even less played on the damn radio .,"speaking of radio , it sux .",except for some stations in austin .,and i do n't know the call letters .,i 'm bad at remembering things .,i guess that may be why i procrastinate .,"my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as i do , so i know he does n't believe me when i say `` i do n't remember '' .","but in fact , i really do n't , and its not because i drink like every day or because i 'm on a drug , because yes i do drink , but not in large quantities ( binge drinking ) like some people and i only do so on","the weekends strictly never on school days , and i do n't do drugs .","speaking of drugs , i knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them , but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away .","already i have open invitations from people i 've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them , and one guy who said he could get me any drug i wanted free for the first time .","i can just brush these things aside because they do n't interest me or anything , but i get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation , but i do n't let that bother me , because if they are going to judge me from","what they hear and not by who i really am , they arent worth my time .","my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said , and i never have .",some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before i had ever met them .,now we 're as close as brothers in a sense .,"i love my friends , i do n't really know what id do without them .","my biggest fear does n't seem to be what kind of future i have or if i will ever be successful , or if i will let my parents down ( god forbid though ) , but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again .","but when i think about it , its the stupidist thing , because today , the world is smaller than ever , and anyone can be found with the click of a button .","so i do n't really know why i feel this way or anything , nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way , so i do n't really have an explanation for this feeling , and being the smart ass that i am making fun of

"right now , i 'm a little worried .",i just stopped talking to my friend nick on the phone and he was talking about claiming credit and what not .,i hope i 'm not forgetting to do something or else i 'll be in trouble .,that 's the last thing i need right now is trouble .,"my dad would kill me if i did something stupid ( e. g. forgetting to do something i needed to do ) and was disenrolled from

about it .",i 'd much rather be surprised than to know something was coming and have nothing to do about it .,it would be like a giant meteor coming to destroy the world .,i would make rather just die in a giant flash of light than have to worry for weeks knowing that there was nothing i could do to stop it from happening .,"in deep impact the president broadcasted to the world that there was an asteroid coming on a collision course with earth , i would hate that .","sure they are going to try to stop it , but i do n't have that much faith in the us government to fix poverty let alone stop an asteroid from killing us all .",dig a giant hole in the ground .,"sure , that 'll work .","but anyway , i hope nothing bad happens to me .","this whole college thing is a new experience for me , i 'm not used to taking responsibility for everything like i have to now .","i 'm alone up here , except for my sister not that she can do anything .",if i screw up it 's my fault and i have to live with my mistake .,"and even if i do mess up , what would happen ?",i 'd get dropped from a few classes and i 'd have to wait another semester before doing the classes that i want to get done now .,"it

people here are n't complete idiots .,honors dorm and all .,also people are maturing i think .,there are n't as many clique-ish people here .,people are more accepting of other people 's views and lifestyles .,"it might just be that we 're all in a daze from being thrown into the college and are just looking for something to hold on to , but it could be maturing .",i hope it 's maturing .,before in high school nobody would talk to me .,i think i scared them .,but here it 's different .,here people do n't seem to care .,"i think i have to give the whole `` god you 're so hot lets be

.","i 've met people that i 'd like to get to know better , and they are n't model types .",i 've seen those types too and they do n't impress me much at all .,but i think the real thing that 's keeping me from getting to know any of the people i 'd like to know better is my shyness .,"i 'm not used to being social , so being thrown into a dorm with so many other social people is a strange change for me .",it takes some getting used to .,"i need to adapt i guess , become more comfortable with my surroundings and my place in the surroundings .",my friend casey became engaged too .,that scares me .,"he 's 18 i think , maybe 19 , probably 18. right now , i 'm only 17 but i can not see myself getting engaged to be married in a year .","18 years , when the average lifespan of a person is over 70. that 's 50 years , a long time to stay married .",and if i do get married i never want to get a divorce .,i 'd rather spend another year making sure she 's the one than finding out a year into our marriage when my wife might be with child or something else .,"maybe i 'm just old fashioned , but i think that 's the way it should be .",but i ca n't tell casey that .,"it 's his life , i 've seen him and melissa together and they are a good couple , but people change you know .","maybe it 's just my fear of the unknown or maybe it 's true , but marriage ties you down , it keeps you from changing , it 's binding .",i 'd hate to see casey or melissa 's life ruined by this .,"or at least i hope they do n't get married until much later , and just stay engaged .","maybe i care too

first a bit of background last friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice i guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened i guess i am the kind of person who,analyzes what they do after the fact and right now i 'm trying to go through my emotions really was n't afraid i wonder why i mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but,as it was nothing happened so really i just kid of went on with my life so i 'm not dwelling on the crash what i am dwelling on is the fact that i was over the crash in a meter of minutes this is the kind of thing that,shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine i 'm not more or less kind i do n't enjoy life more i even had fun that weekend i do n't feel that i am truly any closer to god i am not praying any more,not that that is how i judge my relationship with god but even how i judge my relationship a no closer weird i should have done this later on i think better at night but if i wrote what i was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper i,would lose these thought so i guess it is better this way i can always rewrite what i type onto paper but then i would feel the urge to revise and i have n't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet i mean what is,what i truly think and feel what is spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what i can put together over time so i have n't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what i write neater or type it i guess,they are both valid or it 's hard to type as fast as i think why i write on paper what i this but then even i ca n't read what i write half the time on a more petty note i am worried about math i just have no,idea what to expect but that is something that i can put to the back o my mind i 'm trying not to think of anything school related because i want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok i 'm worried about math because i,do n't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.318865 0.198347 -0.272869 -0.318187 -0.701583 -0.125061 -0.443613 -0.083583 -0.736625 -0.488206 8.111509 -0.590446 -0.322095 0.76308 -0.897183 0.0 -0.04277 -0.580847 -0.005358 0.391899 0.099882 0.122833 -1.219165 1.319724 0.044649 0.421926 0.832877 0.495993 -0.692164 -1.231555 -0.662832 -1.430891 0.352564 1.163658 -0.666166 -0.642023 1.954591 0.546557 0.270343 0.605344 -1.038726 0.808985 -0.238266 -1.684065 -1.029782 -1.542652 0.045975 -1.525718 -1.550129 -0.990827 -0.40749 -0.205578 -0.201852 -0.903715 -0.908721 2.582212 5.926392 -0.954251 -0.915247 0.529872 -0.58571 2.151926 1.198478 -0.236024 -0.040389 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.387564 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.070263 -0.422267 -0.235182 -0.451544 -0.408772 -2.416536 4.530745 3.813243 4.681718 4.111958 4.838853,461
i have done these things before and i really do n't think that they work .,i had to do one in english one time and i hated it .,i guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really is n't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now i will indulge the assignment and try,to switch my thoughts all around .,"i love scream , its on the tv right now and i like this movie .",; i here that the second one is do out this winter so i 'm excited .,i really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain .,the brain is so complex .,i used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew i was thinking about itself .,"hmmm , i do n't know what to say exactly .",i am gon na play some pool after i get done writing this paper .,i have a pool table at home so i am probably better than average but lately i 've been playing worse and worse .,it really frustrates me too .,i hate when i do n't play basketball for a while because then i go back and i 'm just a little out of rythem or i miss a simple shot or something .,recently i have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and i feel bad about that because i always pre3ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you ca n't breathe in as much .,i 'm being a bit distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up .,i do n't know i f i can really fill up another ten minutes but i guess i can because i have to .,it really is n't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because i 've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so i do n't think your mind can wonder as much .,along those lines i do n't know if i agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because i know i do n't think of sex that much .,imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny a hot naked women flashed into your mind .,how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life .,i often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is .,"i wish that they thought about it as much as guys , but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really ca n't have that lets see mgmhmmhfmfm sorry .",i coughed .,ehehehehe i think i have come to another point of not really being in a thought process .,i wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get i would love to be able to read some of them .,i think that you should post some of them in class so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries .,i do n't know what i 've been told .,i like led zep but not all of their stuff .,it is pretty good though .,i wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades .,i hope so oh my time is up so i 'm gon na go know .,bye bye baby !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.337081 -0.456979 -0.107247 -0.506955 -0.039333 0.819069 -0.009756 -0.766884 -0.535657 -0.261007 -0.086745 -0.590446 -0.113162 -0.265091 0.255751 0.0 -0.04277 0.272885 -0.086404 0.273748 -0.017445 2.374076 -0.799001 -1.271222 -0.021889 0.546431 0.133411 0.212521 0.380763 0.418432 1.263033 0.10788 0.116641 -0.906028 -0.067591 -0.688521 1.921529 1.43563 2.667904 0.008678 -0.401722 0.732359 -0.42002 -1.386248 -0.709582 -0.651566 -0.75146 -0.491329 -1.095146 0.100173 0.627052 -0.740414 0.067951 -0.376715 -0.27453 -1.154294 -0.915637 -0.954251 -0.492267 0.008654 -1.452146 0.089226 -0.480161 2.005875 -0.546834 1.176066 -0.086094 -0.586431 -1.122136 -0.073676 0.6974 -0.607823 0.467409 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.02047 -0.451544 0.194429 -0.90676 4.873546 3.653401 4.382497 4.424294 5.080532,88

sitting around without twenty minutes to spare .","i really am kind of overwhelmed by the class and university in general , not that i 've told anyone because that 's just not how i deal with my problems .","i scheduled my classes so that i have these breaks in between that i could presumably use to study , but i instead retire to my dorm room to eat macaroni and watch a movie .","i watch too many movies in the first place ( i 'm a theater major , so it 's basically study ) , but i have n't placed any amount of time into actual studying for classes like biology that i know i have trouble with .","between that and the massive theater program , it 's just a bit too much .","here i am , now the tiny fish in the pond when i 've spend the last four years on top of the game as far as acting was concerned .","it 's just a different place , different circumstances , and i just do n't know where i fit in yet .",i understand that i have to learn the ropes and pay my dues and then eventually i 'll be on top ( best case scenario anyway ) .,but what will i do if this really is n't the path best meant for me ?,"i really , honestly do n't think i 'd be able to survive in a desk job for the rest of my working life , and if i do n't make it as an actor , chances are , that 's exactly what i 'll have to do .","that prospect terrifies me even more than the class thing , or i guess goes along with it , because to even have a chance at success in the entertainment industry i have to have a broad range of intelligences not only within the field , but general knowhow as","well , so i 'm back to the first worry .","it just seems like it 's never good enough , i went to junior high in colorado where i was the smartest kid in the school , the guy everybody and their dog went to for the answer , i come to texas and suddenly , i 'm not the",best anymore .,"which was alright with me , it unloaded that pressure , blah , blah , but i lost my initiative to try harder than everybody else to get the grade .","since then , my identity has been kind of in the in-between realm , i have intelligence , i was in the top 10 percent of my class , but most of the actual retained knowledge i have from high school is pop-culture trivia , but i think i could",still hold my own on jeopardy .,"that is something that made me feel better about college , about a week before i came here , they were showing the jeopardy college championships , most participants hailing from the ivy leage , or whatever , and i just tore them apart , even in stuff like chemistry","which i had thought was long gone from my memory after sophomore year , who knew ?","so i guess i feel alright about classes in the end , maybe it 's just because i feel so boring just hanging in my room all the time and do n't really feel a part of the student body .","i 'm sure it 'll happen sooner or later , but like most occurances in the history of man , it 's over a girl .","long distance relationships are really hard , and here i am trying to pull one off in freshman year , it 's going great so far , and i guess it says something that going out and partying runs a distant second to a five minute phone conversation with her",", but it 's just not helping me become a longhorn .","i love her to death , i really do , so i just have n't worried about it , i figured that it 'd work itself out , and i think it still will .","adjustment is hard , especially such an immense one .","gah , college .","i 've started to believe that there 's a soundtrack to life , i guess we 'll probably cover that with the psych ta at some point in time , but seriously .","depending on what 's going on in my life , i have certain predelections to what kinds of music , and specific songs i listen to , and i guess it 's beyond obvious that it has some psychological base , but it 's all the time now .","i have bruce springsteen 's secret garden running through my head right now , most likely because i just started thinking about my girlfriend a while back , which made me think of the times we 've spent together , and for some reason bringing about the two of us",sitting and watching jerry maguire and remembering springsteen from the soundtrack and noticing the correlation of the lyrics with my feelings for this girl .,"it probably was n't very smart to have done this this morning , i do n't feel like my thoughts are in order .","it 's the morning of september 11th , i just realized .","i 'm not worried though , i have faith in this country , i have faith in my own ideals of freedom and life and soforth .",bring em on .,"if they attack again , i really do n't think we can stop them , and it 'll suck having more american lives lost , but they ca n't tear down who we are .","there 's my bit of

"the first thought that enters into my mind is my parents , whom i have been thinking about since i left houston for college .","it 's so different here , but not necessarily bad .",i have always been under the protection of my parents .,"but here , i do n't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed , and what to do .","i literally make all my choices , which i have to admit , i do n't always make the best decisions .",i do n't study when i know i should .,"sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that i know i should , and doing things like going out and having fun .",i feel like i should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute .,"but back to my parents , i feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me , because i am the last kid to leave home .",my mom has been crying constantly and i know that she is lonely because she does n't have me bumming around the house and eating her food .,sometimes i even feel sad because i now realize all the things my parents have done for me .,even though i thought they were always against me .,"when i think about the things they have sacrificed for me , i get teary .",especially when i think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before i left for austin .,"i got an acura integra , nothing i had ever expected .",i was so ecstatic and i had never gotten such a great present in my whole life .,i know that my dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than i had expected .,and now i 'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that i had taken for granted .,i really miss my parents and sometimes i have trouble dealing with it .,it 's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own .,my values are seriously getting tested because i do n't have them to give me advice anymore .,all i keep thinking is how much i love them and how i can possibly show my gratitude for them .,college is a tough thing .,"even though i went to an enormous high school , it ca n't compare to college .","my classes are huge , and sometimes very monotonous and boring .","surprisingly , the class i had thought was going to be tough and boring , became one of my favorites , economy .","mainly because my professor , hamermesh , is a great teacher .",he is lively and so humorous .,"the other classes , i really do n't care for much .",one thing i do hate about college life is the roommates .,"i live off campus on enfield , in a really nice apartment'condo .",my dad bought it with the intention that i have a nice place to live .,"it is two stories , and i have been trying to decorate it the best that i can .",but the problem is that i have to have roommates .,"one is this white girl , karmin , who i never met .","my dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in austin , looking for a roommate and she applied .","the other is a chinese girl , laura , i have known since i was a child .","i share a room with laura , so karmin has her own room , and she pays a little more .","however , i still end up paying more because it 's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways .","so karmin pays 350 for her own room , which i consider a good deal .","laura is really messy , which bothers the heck out of me .","but lately , i have been dealing with it pretty well .",karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind .,she is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household .,"but she is messy , especially in public areas and i am the one who has to clean up after her .",and the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy .,"she has a big tv in her own room , and vcr and then on the other hand , comes and watches tv that laura and i own .",so we are not allowed to use it .,"i borrowed her vcr the other day , and she asked me , `` when are you going to buy your own vcr ?","'' still , she is n't willing to share but does n't mind using our things .",same with the food .,"i really feel the need to tell her off , because she sure is getting a good deal living over here , and she ca n't have the right to treat this place as her own , she needs to respect us .","not only that , she hammered nails all up in her room , knowing that she is only living her for a year and it 's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next .","that 's my biggest problem and whenever i talk about it , i feel really agitated and stressed .","well , all i feel now is relief though , because my 20 minutes are up !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i just opened itunes and chose to play miles davis 's album called `` a tribute to jack johnson '' .,the first song `` right off '' begins with a strong groove .,this music first puts me into a pretty good mood .,it motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise .,now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up .,"larry coryell is on guitar i believe , if not i 'm pretty sure it 's john mclaughlin .",now miles is playing .,gosh .,he 's quite an impressive player .,he 's not showing off by playing a note every second .,he takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody .,and they 're always good too .,"i 'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime , to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing , because of a difference in style from the popular , well-advertised music of the 90 's",and 00 's .,or otherwise some people are n't even given the chance to be exposed to it .,my roommate just came in the room .,"speak of the devil , eh ?",take him for example .,"when i first met him and asked what he listened to , the first two things he said were `` metallica and linkin park '' .",both of which i am not biased against or hold negative regard towards .,actually i find both bands to be quite interesting .,"i was exposed to metallica and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school , and definately listened to it quite extensively .",side note : it 's getting hot and i 'm turning on the fan .,could this music and the pressure to write as fast as i can be causing my body to heat up ?,that could be quite interesting .,going back .,"i find it weird , well not weird but sad basically , that people like my roommate have n't heard and do n't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes .",`` new '' meaning `` previously unknown '' as opposed to recently released .,the song just phased into an ambient sound while miles is playing over it .,"the drums , bass , and guitar have dropped out .",when the jam comes back in .,and here it comes .,oh yes .,well done .,movement ( change ) in music i have realized ( as a good explanation ) is what creates uniqueness and good sound .,change can include any part of sound .,"pitch , tempo , tambre , etc .",now it 's just the bass and miles .,"on this album is billy cobham on drums , herbie hancock is on keyboards .",i 'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head .,my roommate is playing video games behind me .,i understand his addiction .,i used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school .,i went to an arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics .,"obviously i did well enough to get into ut , but sadly not well enough for my own standards , although i did not realize it at the time .","i quit playing games during my senior year in high school , picked up some other bad habits , but since moving to austin for school things have changed nicely , and although i 'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet , i guess",i feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future .,"although the future is quite unexpected , otherwise i do n't really know what i 'm going to do .",the song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it .,and time 's up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.750677 0.176213 -0.985917 0.055498 -0.799217 -0.670743 1.704709 1.450319 1.075929 -0.170128 -0.185341 -0.016598 0.959711 -0.912217 1.219291 0.0 -0.04277 -2.487033 -1.820526 -0.795527 -2.135025 -0.742368 -0.503752 0.622693 -0.044938 1.57897 0.905752 0.036615 0.82287 1.711577 -1.100231 -0.320988 -0.82066 -0.457926 -1.017959 -0.704629 -1.148866 -0.890641 -0.585002 -1.588302 3.862246 -0.0836 -0.21933 0.408209 -1.083338 1.885259 -0.435616 -0.510408 1.192987 -1.112506 -0.262144 -0.495299 -0.237346 -1.766069 -0.557672 2.499818 3.104959 1.785025 0.783392 -1.155558 -0.063458 0.67444 0.004422 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.294536 0.345275 0.083394 -0.23436 -0.013274 -0.37208 -0.106009 3.334315 0.243304 1.512088 0.17134 0.724393 3.849377 3.341076 4.543819 4.11972 5.045488,2388
"sometimes i like stream of conscience writing because when i write fictional or nonfictional stories , that is usually the style of writing i use .",i used to write a lot when i was younger and planned on becoming a writer .,i stopped at about the 6th grade because that is when i began to focus more on school .,i think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades .,"those institutions should be places for students to want to learn , but now it 's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an a in the class .","now that i 'm in college , i 'm trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes i take , whether they are required or not .",i still have no idea what i want to be when i `` grow up '' besides a movie star .,i 'm open for all sorts of things .,"when i applied to u. t. i wanted to be a big time advertising ceo , but then i decided that would be selling out too much .","within the last couple of months i thought about dental school and becoming a dentist , but i still do n't know .",i would really like to be a movie star and i plan to save up money and go to los angeles 2 summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs .,i know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still do n't become famous i have n't even taken a theater arts class since the 9th grade !,"i do n't think taking theater classes do much though , unless one wants to be in theater , but i do n't want to stage acting , i want to do films .",i think in films to start out with all you need is a little talent ( which i think i have ) and a good looking face'body ( which i am working on .,haha ) so that 's my plan so far .,i have n't told really anyone .,"my best friend thinks that i am going with her to backpack in europe next summer , but i ca n't afford it at all .",i plan on working at a pool hall next summer so i can make a lot of money and save up for my next years apt .,and my famous l. a. trip .,i would also like to take a bus to new york sometime and live independently .,my brother danny did that a few years ago and wrote in a journal the whole time .,i would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in a journal .,"i should probably get a journal now so i can record my little experiences right now , but so far nothing spectacular has happened .","i thought that since i 'm a freshmen in college i 'd be meeting tons of new people and be going on a billion crazy adventures , but i have n't at all .",most of the people at u. t. are from my high school ( i have at least one person from my high school in each class ) so it 's hard to branch out and meet new people .,"i 've also been stressing over money lately because i have to pay for everything ( books , tuition , housing ) myself and i have n't had time to think about doing fun stuff .","i just got a wristband for the texas'ou game , i 'm not that interested in football though .",i like basketball a lot and ca n't wait until ut basketball season starts though .,"i would like to make the most of my time in austin , since it 's such a beautiful and fun city , but i do n't know when to start .","i 'm going to dallas this weekend , so maybe next weekend i 'll hop on one of the buses and tour the city .",sometimes i like not knowing where i 'm going .,i just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of austin away from the campus and the tourist parts .,one day my sister and i took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghetto'barrio part of town .,it was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus .,"we saw 3 cute little boys around the ages of 9,10 , and 11 and i admired how independent they seemed for such a young age .","they got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go , but just decided to go anywhere and i overheard them say `` we 've got 2 hours , where do y'all want to go ?",'' i think i 'm mature compared to my peers at times because i had a dysfunctional family life growing up .,"through high school though , we moved into an upper class neighborhood and i attended a very affluent high school which i sometimes felt like a liberal outcast amongst a bunch of conservatives .",some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off .,but it 's been 20 minutes so i will finish up .,"this was very cathartic , i should really invest in a journal !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities .,last night i felt cranky and could not concentrate much .,i think it had something to do with having two tests on a given thursday .,my nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery .,i noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as i walked to all of my classes .,i thought that meant that there was high humidity or something .,possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat .,i just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations .,one for meningitis and the other for hepetitus b. i felt worried about diseases when i arrived on campus .,"in addition to the worries , i obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that i get the shots .",my left arm feels a little different than usual .,the nurse warned me of possible side effects but i was not too worried about that because i do not have any known allergic reactions .,i think i try to type faster than i am able to and because of it i seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often .,i think that when i was learning how to type i emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy .,my neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp .,my lower back pain has been giving me some trouble .,i remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine .,i felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good .,i came out to be that i had an extra lower back vertabrae .,not too rare but not particurally normal .,my eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now .,"ever since i started wearing contacts , for about 3 years now , i 've been worried about the dryness , redness , and clarity of my eyes .",i might need to use some eye drops now .,i think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects .,i usually do n't think stuff like that will effect me directly .,although some things that i do n't think effect me usually do .,for instance when i got into my car crash about three months ago i didn ; t think that it would happen to me .,my parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but i would usually ignore that fact that i 'll end up in an accident .,"i would n't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful , but i would just let the message slide .",i would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents .,i should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment .,i sometiems feel that people do n't listen to thers anymore .,they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications .,girls might do this more than guys .,but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable .,i would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems .,it 's not that bad but it ; s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do .,i crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes .,i'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night .,this is different though .,i't what i say to myself .,i wonder if that will ever be ignore .,probably not since it 's not someone else controlling me but myself .,control is difficult to explain .,i 'm wondering when this will end .,another minute or so .,after a whild of this i started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not .,i do n't think i ; m a fast typer or a good typer .,just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes .,less by looking at my fingers ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.075232 -0.386137 -0.706319 -1.079214 -1.072874 -2.229488 1.654117 0.126082 0.591281 0.117658 -0.165879 -0.590446 0.423775 -0.446445 2.114665 0.0 -0.04277 -0.470489 0.726131 -0.795527 0.551896 -0.519606 -1.18 0.600504 -0.107545 0.111409 -0.239151 -0.190908 -0.890378 -1.141634 -1.100231 -0.770949 -0.034457 1.092264 -0.746232 -0.026486 1.199249 0.703855 2.074149 -0.232642 2.239627 1.442995 -1.594596 1.729838 1.349402 -0.013989 2.13364 -1.222769 0.867525 -1.509333 -0.137534 -0.082052 0.942168 -1.578541 0.541888 -1.278872 -1.087501 0.878103 -0.786968 1.492478 -1.312331 -0.151081 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.154088 -0.948667 -0.073676 2.163298 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.13099 -0.422267 -0.648393 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.742602 4.030805 3.824028 4.569695 4.613686 4.908411,1869

the first thought that enters my mind is that i have no idea what i am going to say in this assignment .,i have no thoughts or feelings except that i am trying to think about what to say .,"these types of assignments are difficult for me because i usually concentrate on a concrete task , not writing down random thoughts .","because i am a guy , sex just popped into my head .","because i am male , i hope i do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes .","for the next nineteen minutes , the only feelings i will have are those of confustion and befuddlement , for lack of anything to say .","this being my first college writing assignment , i am a little nervous that i may be doing this wrong .",i must change my previous statement that i am confused .,it is more of a fear that i will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it .,my next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time i had left .,only fourteen minutes left .,yahoo .,i just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow .,"it is not that i like volleyball , but that it takes away the gym at gregory for playing basketball , which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights .",( eleven minutes left .,i ca n't wait ) .,"i just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar , spelling , and sentence structure .","this is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment , and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it .","i just saw an empty dr. pepper can in the garbage can and i thought i might like one , but then i realized that i wanted to finish this assignment before getting one .",my next thought was that i wish i had a thesaurus right now because i have used the word `` assignment '' too many times .,"excuse me , someone just knocked on the door .",it was one of my roommate 's friends who scares me because i believe he might go `` postal '' at anytime .,"i had a thought before this person came to the door , but i forgot it now .",it 's okay because i only have to write for seven more minutes .,i am wondering what my `` quote of the day '' will be on my board outside my dorm .,i want to use a quote from the movie `` what about bob '' but i 'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board .,"again , i am having the problem of not knowing what to say .",it must stem from my lack of self-esteem .,i just glanced at the clock and found that i only have to write for two more minutes .,i just realized that i should not have written that down because i could have stopped then and you would n't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences .,"if this `` assignment '' was supposed to show me how my mind works , i am not pleased with the results .",it shows me that my mind does not work that well at all ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.585706 -0.987741 0.562584 -1.405431 -2.072155 -0.783091 0.921504 0.530498 -0.182222 -0.42762 -0.124323 -0.590446 -0.238404 1.435213 2.302156 0.0 -0.04277 -0.532557 0.388391 -0.795527 0.195554 -0.182077 -1.346169 1.843199 0.025509 0.977393 0.441993 0.743724 -1.296436 -1.624919 -1.100231 -1.015919 -0.099161 2.109641 -1.017959 -0.655399 1.780013 2.012912 1.633219 -0.096287 0.335563 0.55286 -1.76917 -0.05878 0.51202 -0.261018 0.013361 -1.487619 -0.518787 -1.506962 -0.434381 0.597591 0.985643 -0.458266 2.144983 -1.001723 -0.168886 1.350122 -0.476952 0.27348 -0.361378 0.222199 -0.480161 -0.250598 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.319312 0.030222 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.0779 4.633999 -1.137 0.649706 -0.083432 -0.322413 4.054271 4.836233 4.17779 4.618113 4.308118,711

stream of consciousness ?,how do you start something so vague .,"i keep a journal which i write in occasionally , but i can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts. `` i 'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness , because that is definitely",what i am feeling right now .,it 's late monday night and i am taking this time to break up the reading that i have fallen behind in .,"while i am technically still studying psychology , it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text .",what is the point of this assignment anyway ?,how could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind ?,i guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject .,the human mind .,there really is no other single entity ( besides the female mind ) which is so complex and irregular .,"humans are an interesting study , which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology , sociology and history .","but psychology really is the king of the social sciences , it 's all but required for a college student .","i could n't believe how stereotypical i felt when i uttered the phrase `` my psych class '' , it 's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet .","now that i mentioned the greek societies on our campus , i 'd like to delve into that a little .","after overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of kinsolving today , ( they travel in packs ) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that sororities and fraternities actually limit social interaction .","sure it 's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick , but i honestly do n't feel compelled to join a fraternity .","free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season , but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality .","fraternity issues become the mindset of the member , and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person , be they in the same frat or not , is almost always taken advantage of .","yes , some fraternities do some good community work , but it limits people into one train of thought , their loyalty is admirable to the members , but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded .","of course , coming from a freshman non-frat male , that sounds like every other person with an opinion , ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality .","i really do n't oppose the fraternity'sorority concept , because it is a need some people truly need filled .","but the sight of another party where 70 % of the attendance is male , 20 % are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people , and the other 10 % are passed out , it makes them all seem the same .","i feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody , but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the kappa party or the pi phi foam bash , but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked",out of those parties .,"i feel definitely stereotypical again , from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties , could i possibly be the more prototypical male ?","well , here 's the sinker , it 's time to discuss sports .","i cover them for a newspaper , but honestly i 'm just like another fan , but willing to put in the work .","too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio , it 's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space .","any fan with a computer can put together that the cowboys are in a rebuilding year , but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices , meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story .",i guess i am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take ' about the latest controversy regarding sports .,"that 's not to say that all of them are garbage , but too many of them i find repetitive and dull , and bringing nothing new to the argument .","covering a sport is different than giving an opinion , and i enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air .","i love the hunt , and that not only makes me strange , but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer .","of course , as a college freshman , i really do n't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling , but i figure the experience could n't hurt .","much like my decision to take this psychology class , it may seem stereotypical , but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others .","my time is up , i am sorry to whoever is reading this , it must seem very much like the others i 'm sure , but i look forward to this class and i thank you for this very interesting assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"i 'm uncertain what to write , i can feel my unwashed body because i just woke up and i 'm wondering how to put my words into the correct phrases and i 'm focusing on how to follow my stream of thought , the refrigerator i had trouble spelling",that word is making a blanked out for a second a very fuzzy kind of comforting machine noise everything is quiet kate is my roommate i feel like i have to explain it to you even though youre a computer or something a program i guess crap im digressing well,shes asleep i didnt know that i had so much trouble typing when i was tired and what time is i do n't know has it really only been 2 minutes or so what am i supposed to type about i think i 'm stressing out scientolgists expelled me they,told me i was too stressed i guess i am the stress test that was free my elbows are stiff went ballistic when i tried it only 2 minutes this is harder than i though stream of conscious makes me think of finnigans wake only 4 people in the world,know exactly how to interpret finnigans wake its the hardest book in the world tim introduced that book to me he tried to read it stupid cheating bastard i hope language isnt a problem i curse but this is a school assignment grr i feel dumb and thats not good,i shouldnt feel dumb neck is getting stiff i guess my train of thought is confusing who is going to read this and why and should i be using punctuation neil is asleep too i should eat my stomach grumbling breathing in and out this totally doesnt make sense what,makes a really good stream of conscious writing i guess it doesnt matter thats not the point of this excercise i really like psychology its really interesting dumb scientologists told me that it was a overrated science and that more people were killed in the era that psychology was born,i wonder if it was because more people were killed that psychology became more important i thought more peeps were killed because technology was greater potential to kill was greater scientologists are creepy they are so cultist i wonder if they are as brainwashed as i feel they are and,im just rambling but i guess thats what we 're supposed to do my hands are just doing what they normally do when they type i kind of am randomly putting punctuation does stream of conscious require punctuation ?,i hope not .,this is getting rather tedious but i have to finish it my feel are getting cold and im getting kind of bored i think i should raise the blinds to let more sunlight in and put on a sweater the ac is really high in my room antartica aruna calls,it i love aruna she 's such a great sister is this a narrative or a record of my thoughts and feelings i feel like i should be telling about what i 'm doing but maybe i should just put down what i 'm thinking what am i thinking ear,itches got to scratch it and my hands are like a separate entity they keep on continuously typing and my mind is just running in a completely different direction i guess it is easier to do this sort of thing online and on the computer if i was writing i,would hate this it wouldnt flow as much wow so i think i 'm lining up thoughts in my head to put down on paper is this what i do in essays maybe thats why my essays arent very great i do n't really think them out i just blurt,them out on to paper like i do in conversation thats a bad trait i type kind of fast how long is this supposed to be i 'm glad i 'm getting this down im curious as to what the results are and i really want to do well in,this class its really cool too bad i had to sit in the very back last time i feel sort of like an outcast do i feel like an outcast in other situations i used to wanted to be a psychologists why did i decide against that again and am,i getting down the connections of why i 'm thinking this thought then that thought should i be writing that down that this makes me think of that and thats why i said this i guess thoughts just spontaneously came to my mind and i write them down maybe this,makes me more impulsive in my regular life am i weird am i blanked out for a second i keep blocking out the sensation of my body except for the feeling of my elbows continously rubbing against the table the the palms of my hands against the keyboard crick in,neck again i wonder if i have trouble studying because i get into uncomfortable positions and thats why i ca n't lose myself into the words on the text like i do when reading novels itd be interesting to hear or see other peoples stream of conscious writing if youre,writing a novel in the stream of conscious way can you go back and edit it i guess so thats a dumb question its a novel meant to guide you through the stream of conscious not actually a stream of conscious writing thatd be messed up if you did a,story i do n't think i know what i 'm trying to say next topic 14 minutes wow i didnt think time was flying by so fast 1tym with that song is good i wish i could understand korean good songs what does this stream of conscious say about me,i keep shifting and my butt 's going numb and little patches of skin are itchy i have to go at 4 to port aransas i hope its worth it i have a lot of catching up to do i had so much fun yesterday i wish that that could,happen more often allen is awesome too bad soap operas and stuff happen too bad .,"i like both guys is that a problem who wants to hear about this not me , it 's just a bad cycle of thought better think positively scientologists look all blank behind the eyes very creepy as if their cultish mindset has washed all personality way and they are","all clones or machines programmed to thinki and persuade in a certain way that 's too weird i ca n't believe i almost bought into it actually i can , i just want to be a better me who doesnt that easy solution they provide is really attractive if it",works but look at them they are creepy and give me strange vibes only 4 more minutes yay i 'm not depressed like they said that 's really sad i just like to analyze and see why people do morbid bad things i just like listening and now i 'm,all defensive i should n't do that i have nothing to defend against no one is attacking me silly i'im just writing down my thoughts i guess that whole experience traumatized me and i have more stress because of it my hair is tickling me its so quiet i heard,a door slam i wonder who that is i need to talk to more people on my wing i guess i can do that this weekend but i should really focus more on studying i have such a distracted personality but i guess i have charm so its okay thats,what im told but what do i want ?,i have to figure that out my legs are crossed it 's a cool feeling but at the same time i ca n't hold that position for long my mind really makes some strange leaps but what about geniuses how do they think do their minds differ all that much,i wonder if they really have a different brain wave or patter oon 19 minutes ooh 30 seconds i 'm almost through i wonder what they have to say this is exciting very cool very very cool i should have solved math equations that would have been cool but that,'s not the point of this i 'm such a nerd do i finished sweet !, , , , , ,

"i 'm sitting here thinking that it 's rather nice that the ethernet in my dorm is finally up , although i feel bad that my roommate is still having problems with her computer .",she has an ibm aptiva and it seems that the wireless ethernet card just does n't agree with her system .,"i staring at my philosophy book in front of me , and i think that drug legalization is an interesting subject .",i 've never considered drug legalization before .,i always thought that drugs were bad and that was the final end to the case .,"however , all these philosophers ( who are n't all that old and ancient ) think that legalizing drugs might be a good idea .","not that they want to promote drug use and make it easy to obtain for everyone , but legalized in a restricted fashion like cigarettes and alcohol .",i also need to write some letters to my friends and stuff back home after this assignment since i have n't talked to them in such a long time .,"i ca n't decide which sort of stationary to use since i collect stationary and stickers , so there is a wide variety to choose from .",i miss them greatly since i do n't have as many friends in austin as i do back in houston .,i have n't been here long enough .,"there are my roommates , though .","as a matter of fact , i 'm curious about whom my roommate is calling right now since he seems like a close friend .","she 's talking about food since she did n't get any before she came back , and that makes my stomach respond slightly .","i only had 3 slices of pizza for dinner , and that apparently is n't enough since my stomach rumbled when my roommate mentioned food .","she also asked me if a friend of ours was 21 or not , but i do n't know .",he 's a nice guy since he helped me with my phone jack .,i could n't plug in my phone since the jack had been painted over to the point where the wires ca n't even register each other .,i think i 'm running out of things to say since i ca n't imagine what else might be of interest to occupy my mind .,i 've nothing to look forward to this evening except reading assignments from all of my classes .,"i realize that reading is essential to the learning process , but all these long chapters are tedious .",there is n't too much of great interest in reading these heavy textbooks .,i wish we had textbooks like they do in japan .,their textbooks are really small and light so they do n't get backaches and have to lug around huge backpacks .,perhaps people in america will slowly grow shorter since the weight of backpacks stunts the growth of young people in this country while japanese children grow taller with the freedom of light backpacks .,it would also be nice if international music from japan and other countries would be more accessible here .,it 's hard to find japanese popular music in texas .,"you have to either order them off the internet , or look for the small stores that specialize in importing these types of cds .","it is rather expensive , too , but it is kind of ironic that japanese cds also cost about $ 30 in american dollars in japan .",cds are cheapest in taiwan since they only cost about $ 5 $ 10american dollars there .,"it would be nice if i could visit taiwan often , but i do n't have the time and plane tickets cost more money than i have to spend on leisure travel in a year .",i think that is a pity since i would like to see my uncle and my grandmother more often .,and the fruits in taiwan are of a much greater variety and sweetness .,the same type of fruit here is much smaller in size and a great deal more expensive .,they do n't taste the same either .,"i think my dad misses taiwan the most , although he has made many friends in houston .","i miss having chinese food every night , too .",it feels weird not using chopsticks for two weeks in a row .,i have to remember to bring some the next time i went back to houston .,i really miss my dad 's cooking .,he cooks really well .,and he knows where all the good chinese restaurants are .,it 's hard for me to order food myself since i do n't know the names of the dishes .,"the names i do know are in chinese , so sometimes i pronounce them wrong and the waitress gives me this funny look .","i think the food i like best at this particular time is vietnamese noodles , dim sum , and this chicken steak with rice .","i think i can get vietnamese noodles here , but dim sum is something best eaten in a big city because it 's a specialty that only some cooks can get right .",i am not sure about the last one since i am unfamiliar with the chinese restaurants around campus .,"it is something i may do during the weekend , exploring the nearby food places to see what is good to eat around here .","i really talk about food a lot when i 'm hungry , it seems .","there is n't much in my room 's refrigerator since i have n't gotten anything as of late , and it would be rude to eat everything that my roommates bought .",i shall have to go to the store in the morning or after school to obtain some snacks for when i am hungry like i am now .,the cafeteria here closes at 7 pm so i ca n't do anything about being hungry at the moment .,i have a screen mate program that creates little lambs to wander around my computer screen .,"there are five of them wandering around right now , and one of them just sneezed .",i think it is funny since i just sneezed recently .,"these lambs are very adorable , and they do n't take up much computer space .","they sleep and jump around , basically entertaining me while i 'm doing my homework or just when i 'm surfing around the internet .","i love being connected to the internet at all times since all of my classes post important information on the web , and because i like to do personal research of my own into the subjects and hobbies i cultivate .","it is also good for multiplayer games , but there seems to be a firewall in my dorm network that prevents me from hosting such games .","it aggravates me greatly ,

it seems as though long distance relationships are destined to fail .,"with the constant talk being seperated and only available for a short period everyday if even everyday i feel a million miles away from my boyfriend , andrew .","september 7th is our 2nd month anniversary and for his birthday he asked for a trip to new york to see the finals of the us open , which is amazing and quite costly

habits and so on .","not that i do n't absolutely love to be here in austin away from dallas , i mean im exactly where i want to be , in austin the greatest city ever , well in texas for sure , i am

have the opportunity to know so many girls on such a close level but it just seems so hard to get to know them i guess .,its just a struggle that im not sure i will be able to be comfotable with anytime soon .,"tonight i went out once again with old high school friends to the gym , its just easier to be close with those who you are already close with .","at the gym i ran into ex boyfriend who i just knew i would never see again , he wants to go to dinner , ahhh i just ca n't see myself going through being near him but not with him .","so after talking to him i ran back to my comfort zone ,

that .,"but once i was there i just loved it , it motivated me so much , just as much as joining the sorority did , i decided i should stick it out and just go for it .","tomorrow begins the condidtioning for it , i am so excited , its just like soccer tryouts for club soccer when i was in high school .","wow i ca n't believe that i might possibly be on the rowing team , i have always wanted to be that little girl in the front of the boat , and a girl on the team said i was small enough , well obviously i have never been tall",", to be that girl .","oh i forgot the name for that position but nevertheless i am pumped , and slightly nervous that i might not be able to pump up the other 8 girls on the boat , i think that is how many .","everything seems to cost so much these days too , i wanted to go with my sorority gals to new orleans for the tulane game but i really do n't know that i have $ 100 to just throw away on a weekend , not like i wo n't remember","it forever

about it that does not at all sound fun .","i wonder why the bums on the drag do n't go somewhere else , but imagine all the different types of people they see a day , it just seems so hectic , maybe

its patty .,its always patty .,i ca n't believe i got a yellow wrist band !,its so awesome .,it really annoys me how i always press the caps lock button when i 'm typing .,i think i do it like once a minute .,i must be the worst typer in the world .,it really grosses me out to find my roommate 's hair all over my floor .,i do n't know why she ca n't just pick up the dust buster once in a while

close , but your bed is so much closer .",i hope my parents are n't like shocked when they see me again .,lol .,where is patty .,she called like five minutes ago and it definitely does n't take that long to ride the elevator 4 floors .,maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book .,i need to tell her i will need it tonight during study hours .,she will probably be upset .,its my book though .,i really need to put away some of this clean laundry .,what am i going to wear at the white trash party .,i do n't know if i really have anything for that .,i guess i should go to walmart and get a wife

and i can spend it all on things that we want and really do n't need -- he 's a really sweet guy .,"they all say that you 'marry your father ' and i would love to get a guy that 's as sweet as he is , but i just really do n't think that one exists .",so this little princess metaphor is really working for me !,i just can not wait to get married .,i think about that a lot too !,"well , not actually being married , but getting married -- my wedding !",every time i go to a wedding or see a wedding dress or blah blah blah .,it just gets me all excited !,i ca n't wait to dress up all pretty and have everyone look at me and say how beautiful i am .,"ahhh , it 's great to think about !","well i guess that those are probably the only two things that i ever think about -- well except for classes sometimes , oh and being grossly skinny , that would be fun for about a day .","i would hate to be skinny forever , that would be terrible , but you want to hear terrible ?",every guy that i 've ever dated has been skinnier than me .,"now i 'm not fat , i 'm just not skinny and the guys that i date are !","also , every guy i 've dated has also cheated on me , is n't that great for my self esteem ?","i really think so , because now every guy i see i 'm thinking 'hyyyyaaaaah !",i want to beat the snot out of you !,i want to karate chop your face until your eyes bleed !,ahhh !,' .,"and that 's every guy i see , so i 'm thinking that a whole bunch too .",i guess i think of 3 different things now .,"because before it was only two , but then i remembered how much i hated guys and i got to thinking 'well i guess i think about that a lot too ' maybe i 'm not so boring after all .","just kidding , i really feel like i sound terribly superficial -- i think about other things , but my brain has been so full of bullshit lately that there 's not room for much else that wo n't just be covered in the bullshit of my mind as well",case in point .,"i guess that 's my excuse for not thinking , even though it 's really hard for me not to be thinking about something all the time -- that 's what 's wrong with culture today -- we 're always so busy doing something and once there 's nothing to","do , we 're 'bored ' but why is that ?",how can we be bored when we always complain about being too busy .,would n't you think that we 'd welcome this so- called 'boredom ' ?,i think we should .,"i was bored about 17 minutes ago so i decided to do my writing assignment , and here i am !","i guess it feels good to vent things , but i probably would n't do it unless it was an assignment -- it

unpacking , the tv , email , the neighbors , the stupid smoke detector , that is low on batteries , and is constantly , constantly beeping , relentlessly .","and the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor , it is so annoying , between the beeping , and banging , they are enough to drive my absolutely insane .","i went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping , it is so shrill , it 's painful , especially terrible when you 're trying to sleep .","my roommate does n't seem to mind , she can block out almost anything .",i do n't know how she devotes so much time to studying .,i wish i could be more disciplined like that .,i would be much happier with myself .,"but , i am having so much fun .",will study later tonight at barnes and noble 's with amy .,we 'll see how that place is for studying .,"it 's hard not having my car , although most people have theirs .","it 's nice not to be the

easier",if i had it here .,"next year , i will but what car will i have ?",what are my parents going to decide about that ?,what about molly ?,what will she drive ?,will i get my prelude ?,will that be too hard on my parents ?,how are they handling sorority costs ?,"should i get a job soon , to help with all that ?",how are my bills going to be this month ?,i 'm sure the long distance bill on my

out of mind , and i believe that to be very true .",same went for mike .,"but , the longer i 'm away , the less i think about john , and the less i truly miss him .",i think the same goes for him .,it does n't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when i first was here .,but of course that should be expected and it was .,i do n't like the way some things are here .,"i want to get out and meet some different kinds of people , or meet nonfrat type boys , because i 'm not liking the conservative style that much .",it 's not what i 'm used to .,i definitely do n't like how money and status are such an issue .,"it 's ridiculous , it reminds me of the movies .",i did n't think people like that really existed .,"i left california thinking i was getting away from all the selfabsorbed , selfimage , stuff , that i was really growing sick of , only to come somewhere and feel as though i 'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery , based on money , family name",", status , having not really anything to do with how good looking you are , as is the california snob , but how much money your dad makes , or what kind of car you drive , or whether or not you buy an $ 800 shirt to wear",to a frat party .,"it 's all very ridiculous to me , and it makes me sad , and homesick for a place where it 's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time , and where you 're not judged by how much money you have .","i do love how the boys always hold open doors for you , and pay for everything ; those are aspects i do very much enjoy .","i would not want to raise my kids here , i 'm not even sure now if i want to live here after college .","i love a lot of things about it , and i 'm having so much fun , meeting lots of wonderful girls , the guys are a problem for me

like becca did .","it makes me miss john , karl , daniel , jordan , ryan , even so much more .","it makes me miss all my guy friends , and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite , but funny and perverted , to a certain point of course .","i ca n't wait to see john , i wonder how things will be .","i 've decided to tell him how i really feel , knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way .","i think he probably has an idea of the way i feel , i 've probably hinted at it before .","i do have a glimmer of hope , since he 's been signing his letters with the word love , and wrote , `` love , john on the picture he drew , and he is spending at least $ 300 to come out and see me , which unlike","all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make , doing countless hours of work , and now is throwing it all into a three day trip .",it really is incredible to me .,it touches me to think he would do something like that for me .,"i wonder what daniel and karl think about that , especially daniel .","what about jordan , i wonder if mike will find out .",what will he think about that ?,"he once said , regarding the necklace and earrings from daniel , that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever .","well , he knows john never ever has any money , never has a steady job , and mooches off of everyone else .",how would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me ?,maybe then he would open his eyes a little .,probably not though .,"i hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport , i know candace wo n't want to miss any of her classes , for him of course i could , it does n't look like i have any test or quizzes that thursday or friday .",i do have a

i 'm here in the computer lab doing this assignment and wondering how in the world are they going to get any information out of what i write .,i think there is so much out there that we ca n't understand and this is one of them .,last night i had a weird dream well no it was n't last night it was the night before i was in a school but i do n't recall which on and then someone shot me !,yet no one cared .,i was all alone and then my family shows up and they seem interested for a while and then they forget about the situation and wonder around without taking me in to and emergency room .,i thought it was weird but then again i later on had another dream i do n't remember what it was right now but i know that i had to do with lack of attention .,"i figure these dreams are happening because i 'm far away from home and i do n't receive the same attention , its just a matter of adapting to different environments .","its weird how i 'm here in the lab and everyone is in there own little world for instance the girl next to me seem s to be having problems with the computer yet she never asks for help , why ?",and then there 's a girl in front all into her study or research i do n't know what she is doing and she looks so interested .,i really do n't know what else to write i mean those things came to the top of my mind once i started writing but now i do n't know .,i really hope arturo writes to me this coming week i mean he is in the army and i 'm really scared for him specially since his last letter where he told me they were going to send him to iraq .,that sucks because i got attached to him .,specially at prom the night was so perfect everything was going great until it was time to leave to our houses .,"i mean why ca n't i find a guy who 's like him i mean he is great he is sensitive , sweet , crazy , funny i do n't know i could go on but why ca n't i find someone ?",he would be perfect but he is too slim we look like a 10 when were next to each other not that i 'm fat but i 'm fatter than he is .,if he could only gain lets say maybe 25 pounds he would be dream guy material .,ericka is changing a lot i do n't know what her problem is i think it all turns out to be that she has no goal in life .,she knows she wants to be a doctor because that 's what everyone tells her but she does n't really now what it is she want to do with the rest of her life .,"she is a lost child , all she cares for is fun i mean its important to have fun but everyday ?",that 's just not right .,what does she want to have a boyfriend for only for sex ?,she is always talking about some other guy and this and that and what does she expects from this guy .,she changed so much we use to be close friends but now since she is in mexico and has been there for the last year and will be there for the rest of her education i do n't even know if i can still call her a friend .,"it really bothers me how i can get so excited for her when things are going good yet she does n't care if i 'm sad , mad , happy if i need to be hear .",its all about her and just having fun talking to people when they 're happy and be talking dirty and things of that matter ?,why !,i do n't know if she is always been like that just that i had n't noticed or she is just changed .,her friends over there have great influence on her and i personally dislike them i do n't think they will ever do anything with there life 's because they 're simply not able to work for their money they 're so use to asking their dad for money .,they do n't appreciate the value of hard work or the having a do go to school because eventually that will put food on the table for your children .,they are just plain stupid thinking their father will always be around to give them what they want .,and now ericka has become just like them and i hate that .,this writing helps out .,i 've always thought this but not a soul new about it and now god knows who is reading this and wondering what the hell is she complaining about .,or oh well .,i do n't know i just had to say it .,and now i 'm waiting for the 20 minutes to be over using up the rests of the seconds that .,oh well they 're over ., , , , , ,

let 's see .,i 'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone .,this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back .,"not that she 's not a cool person or anything , i just can concentrate better when i 'm alone and when it is quiet .",but that is almost impossibe here in jester .,there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises .,like right now !,"oh well , it is something i must get used to .",or i can do what i did last night .,wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done .,i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night .,my fingers are freezing !,this room is so cold !,"i have n't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room , it is insane .",i 'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket .,i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i can not wear shorts like i used to back at home .,"aw , home !",i think i am starting to miss being at home .,i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me .,"this , ladies and gentlemen , is something that never occurs .","i do go back home on thursday night , but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta .",i am competing in a sports tournament for my church .,i am playing flag football and running track .,another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i 've been dating for less than a month .,"well , i 've known him for about 4 years , but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children 's camp for my church together .","it 's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that , but only because i did n't want to be mean .",he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me .,"that was always an issue for me before , but for some reason , i really do n't care anymore .",he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met .,i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago .,"me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college , we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend .","a week after we broke things off , this new guy i 'm dating told me he had feelings for me .",i was so confused and did n't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks .,but i 'm normally the uptight girl that ca n't let loose and enjoy myself .,"because of that , i decided that i 'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy .",we decided we 'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves .,my ex found out and was extremely jealous .,it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy .,"but oh well , that 's life i guess .","i am really glad i continued to see this other guy , regardless of what my ex had to say .",i spent every day with him until the day i left .,i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much .,he is amazing .,the only thing i 'm worried about is that i 'll fall too hard and too quickly for him .,i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i do n't think i 'm quite ready for another one .,that 's the only problem i 'm having right now .,the fact that he 's a high school student does not bug me as it used to .,but the distance might become an issue .,"it was an issue in a way for me and my ex , so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i 'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex .",but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me .,"but yeah , that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut .",but i am definitely loving it here in austin .,i enjoy all of my professors and classes .,"having two biology classes and a chemistry class , however , can be tough .","in addition i am taking this psychology class , which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting .","other than that i have my freshman seminar class , which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations .",i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment .,"ah , my hands are still so cold .",what do i do ?,my ears are feeling very cold too .,must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room ?,"or my bad , it is the fall now .",same thing .,today is the day for my mile run .,"ever since i moved to austin , i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym .",i absolutely love that place !,and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester .,freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape !,i find that i 've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer .,i really love this lifestyle i have at ut .,"the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming , but i do not feel like i am abusing it .","i did party a lot this weekend , but i did n't drink or anything .",people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset .,i do n't want people to view me as a party girl because i 'm not out of control or anything .,oh well .,i see that this writing is almost up .,that was n't too bad !, , , , , ,

"right now i am sitting here typing , with the tv on in the background and i am feeling very tired .",i think this is because i did n't get nearly enough sleep last night .,"why did n't i get enough sleep , you ask .",well i do n't know .,"i usually go to bed sometime before eleven , or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve .","i guess you could say between 11 and 12 , right ?",yeah .,and i start my day somewhere around 7:30. that is not nearly enough sleep .,but what 's funny is this is the only time of day when i feel really lethargic : around 5 or six o clock .,maybe it is biological .,maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies .,i think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in mexico .,that seems glorious .,not to mention it 's good for you !,you are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy .,even as i type i can feel myself drifting off .,do not fall asleep .,do not fall asleep .,oh great .,i pressed a wrong key and now the time started over .,i had two minutes of typing under my belt .,"that 's beautiful , just beautiful !",i think i will just sit here and make up for that time .,doop de doop .,doop de dooooop .,"well , i 'm very glad it 's friday tomorrow .","not that it makes much of a difference , but still .","i can sleep in on the weekend , that 's a big deal to me .",i 'm not sure what i 'll do with the weekend .,probably catch up on reading for classes .,i 'm really concerned about that .,"i 've been slacking off a bit and that 's just awful , classes have only been in session for what , just two weeks or something .",yuck .,i 'm such a procrastinator .,"well , i do n't know what else to talk about .",this is boring and i 'm getting bored just doing this because i 'd rather be napping .,not to mention the clock says only 3 minutes and i know the true time should be somewhere around five !,"here , this is entertainment .",i will type out a poem completely from memory .,"ladies and gentlemen , the road less traveled by robert frost : two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler , long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth",then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i,"saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way i doubt if i shall ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i , i took the one less traveled",by and that has made all the difference .,"what a beauty of a poem , no ?",i 've always liked it .,do n't remember why i had to memorize it .,probably for a class way back in middle school .,some people have told me they do n't understand the last line .,i just feel secret annoyance towards them .,what 's there not to understand ?,"it 's clear as a bell , people !",i like robert frost .,here 's another one i know called fire and ice : some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what i 've tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice i think i know enough of,"hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice i also like stopping by woods on a snowy evening , the one that ends `` and miles to go before i sleep. `` yep .",also that poem called nothing gold can stay .,why do i know so much about robert frost you ask ?,heck you got me .,i do n't even know .,i just think his poems are nice .,what other poets do i like .,that 's a good question .,i have no idea .,"well , that 's probably not true , but i ca n't think of any at the moment .","in decathlon in school we studied lots of poems , by langston hughes and sylvia plath and robert frost ( a really bad one , though ) and george meredith and lots of other peeps .","some of them were cool , some were most definitely not .","i think i will write a poem of my own , right here , right now .",i call it `` the cat came home '' .,the cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he did n't know was that the owners had moved away they left the lights on they left dishes in the sink the cat came home and in a swift minute did n't know what to,think should i stay or should i go the cat asked himself that day what should i do about this what should i say ?,"well the cat found no answers just an empty litter box so he said , eh who cares and tore up all the socks maybe i should get that one published !","well my time is almost up thank goodness , so i should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment , a summation if you will .",this was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why i do n't get enough sleep .,"yep ,

want to take some kind of jazz class because i need to expand my horizons so i can move to new york or los angeles and be a dancer on broadway or a backup,dancer for some music artist or in someone 's music video .,would it be great if i could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that i could live comfortably ?,"if that was guaranteed , i 'd be there in a heartbeat .",i wonder if this is what i 'm really passionate about .,all the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do .,i mean i have so much fun when i dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me .,it would just be fun a job of pure fun .,"but , come on , who really gets to do what they really want to do .",who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man ?,"people do what they do to make money and i think that 's so sad , but i 'm one of those people , too .",money is important to me .,it does n't rule my life but it is definitely a factor .,i do n't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what i deserve or what i 've earned for it .,and our society is just completely out of whack .,why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws ?,why are teachers so underpaid ?,"they should be some of the highest paid people in the world , i think .","because of them , we are able to learn .",we would be nowhere without our teachers .,that 's such a shame .,it pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality .,just look at hollywood .,"what a mixed up place that is , yet it looks like so much fin to me .",i would love to be famous .,to have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them .,that would be a blast .,all you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines .,"go to awards shows , and travel .",i want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages .,but i do n't want to learn them part way .,i want to be fluent in the way that i do n't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think i 'm stupid like we do when someone ca n't speak our language correctly .,i wonder what that would be like to change cultures .,no one would know anything about you or your past .,like ludwig .,you could be a total loser'reject in our society and be a heartthrob'most popular kid in school in another country .,and you 're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

never seem to be able to motivate myself .",it is really frustrating sometimes .,but that is were the apathy sets in again and i will not take action .,it seems like a cycle that i know at my house

pattern that is similar to mine .",but at least i am working now .,i still have german 506 to complete that is were i am most suffering .,"i need to review , and starting to catch up before i wind up failing .",it would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare .,"me being my only downfall , or rather me causing my own downfall .",at some point i have to break this cycle but sometimes i

before i left for ut that i would be greatly affected t by the people i surround myself with .,i can see how this is partly true but i do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities .,i will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits .,i will be in control of what it is i will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear .,this is the time for me to start caring .,i am not sure what else i can talk about .,i have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse .,my mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and i need an escape .,perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me .,i do n't believe that i have much longer to continue writing on this assignment .,"two very large priorities for the even9ihng that i still have to take care of is my german , which i

"tomorrow i 'm going to go back to my hometown of grapevine , texas , where i get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school , and some friends that have graduated as well , that will be home as",well .,"i guess i 'm looking forward to the weekend , however i realize that i am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at ut .",currently my roommate is pondering why i listen to so much music all the time .,"to tell you the truth , i really do n't know why i do .","one of the reasons may be that i grew up surrounded by music , my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house , as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot .","i just saw the mtv music awards , which was ok. i mean it started out cool and such .","with three great bands on stage at once , however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk .",some bands these days i can hardly consider a `` band '' in the least sense of the word .,i just remembered that i missed my si meeting tonight .,"that which i am not too happy about , but i shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one .",sometimes i wonder why people do n't like dorm life that much .,"i mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people , and sometimes the rooms arent that bad .","not even in jester , which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect .","i 've been to other places and apartments , and i think i still like mine the best .",or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that i recieved .,i hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient .,i get so darn tired after car rides .,"you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours , but you always are .",maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something .,who knows .,i 'm also doing laundry at the same time .,"really different than the laundry back home , seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes .","geez , i 'll be up for a while .","sometimes i wonder why people can be such jerks to others , especially in relationships .","in this summer alone , 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships , either due to faults of their own , or others .","2 of them cheated on the other , which is something that is really bad .","i guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else , you expect the same in return , no matter if you are drunk , stupid , wasted , etc .",it 's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well .,luckily i was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents .,i never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either .,i mean what can you say ?,i 'm sorry ?,you 'll do better next time ?,hardly .,it feels like i 'm typing into a diary or something .,which i do n't keep .,i really want to go see some live bands here in austin .,i mean it is supposedly the live music capital of the world .,or nation .,whichever .,its supposed to have something more than just 6th street .,at least things in austin are n't that bad .,"my roommate 's pretty cool , better than someone else i could 've ended up with .",the food .,could be better .,but its not too bad .,overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly .,barton springs is really really really cold .,man is it cold .,i wish i had something to eat as of right now .,i 'm kinda hungry .,at least the jester express is still open for a while .,some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now .,which is a really good idea .,good thing the time thingy is almost over .,hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well .,i hate doing laundry .,i especially hate ironing .,but i guess they 're something that i 'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie .,carpe diem .,seize the day .,dead poets society .,a great movie .,seizing the day however .,i think at least .,"should only be done in short bursts , and not always .",it just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic .,right ?,some people i know take it way to the extreme .,i wouldnt even know how to write it down .,"so now i 'm wondering who 's going to read this paper , and what they 're going to think .",or if anyone is going to even read it at all ?,pennebaker ?,the asian guy ?,that michelle girl ?,who knows .,that video that was showed last class was pretty weird .,that guy'girl strapped to the machine .,and all those brian waves .,i guess it wasnt `` weird. `` just something that we do n't see that often .,it was pretty cool i guess .,now i also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that i would be detained by the fbi for some criminal knowledge that i may possess for some odd reason .,who knows ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

survey thinks i 'm a girl , since i answered some female only questions .",except i checked the male box when it asked whether i was male or female .,but it kept on asking me questions that were very feminine .,i hope i do n't get in trouble for that .,"but i doubt it , since there will probably be other people who will do the exact same thing i did .",there 's always somebody else .,i hope i do n't get put into some strange category or something .,what i did n't understand about the survey was that why did it ask some of the same questions over again .,i think it had to do something with me answering female only questions .,i do n't know if that 's why but i answered most all of them except this one question that asked if i was more guilty about eating than most girls .,"i was like : `` hold up , what 's going on ?",this survey thinks i 'm a girl !,"'' damn , well whatever it 's o. k. everybody makes mistakes and i 'm not going to come down on myself because of that .",my friends staring at my assignment right now and saying this is an easy assignment .,"well i guess it is , it 's just that my fingers are tired .","i do n't want to type anymore , and i have 2 more minutes left .",yippee !,after this i 'm going to take a break and then do writing assignment number 2. after i finish that i 'll take a nap and start on calculus .,"oh man , so much work to do !",i should have started earlier instead of playing these first few weeks of school .,well my time 's up .,so goodbye !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

well today i went with my friend kai to his texas crew orientation .,"he tried to get me to join , but i just do n't think that crew would be the sport for me .",i prefer to play volleyball above all other sports .,"just this past week , i signed up for the volleyball teams here at ut .","i would really enjoy to play for the school , or at least on a team , competing with others .","i used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in houston , i guess that 's why i like it so much .","i miss being around my family , but i know that they are proud of me for being here at ut .","i wanted to go back this weekend , since it 's a 3 day weekend , unfortunately , i am a little behind in my classes , so i wanted to take advantage of this time to catch up and maybe get ahead a little .","the reason which i am behind in my classes , which is so unlike me , is probably because i am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time .",i believe that this is happening because of the long summer .,"well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me , which for some reason i have been avoiding .","i guess because i do n't want anything to do with him , i do n't even consider him a good friend .","just now , my friend whom which i met through hang out , a gay organization here on campus , instant-messaged me asking me to go out .","he has been taking me out , to places i would n't even think of going , since i arrived here at ut .",now him i do consider him a good friend .,"he is a really good guy , really fun to be around with .","i do n't know if i am starting to develop feelings for him , which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school .","i spent last night at his house , just hanging out , talking about whatever came to our minds , and fell asleep on his bed .","nothing happened , but for some reason , i sort of wanted something to .","i believe that i wanted something to happen because i have been feeling very lonely these past few days , maybe because of i need a boyfriend , or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give , or not going home for the weekend .",or maybe i just genuinely like him .,"well i guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in houston 2 days ago , and my mom is going to mail it to me , and if all goes as planned , i will be able to keep the money for myself",", if financial aid allows me to .",so i will use that money to pay off my bank bill .,"and today , my mom called , and i felt like i was there even though we are 3 hours away , which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend .","right now , i do n't want a boyfriend for various reasons .","one , i have decided to put off sex until i get tested for hiv .","i do n't have suspicions that i may have it , but i have had unprotected sex , and so i just want to be sure .","second , i need to stay focused on my school work , and having a boyfriend may distract me .","third , i just do n't know if i can handle going through what i went through with my ex all over again .","not that it would necessarily happen again , but i just do n't want to take the risk .",or maybe i should just be brave and take a risk .,i need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.043791 -0.169388 -0.165312 -0.555963 -0.637403 0.129874 0.057549 -0.051221 -0.600407 -0.094395 -0.065238 -0.590446 -0.572719 1.15779 -0.116458 0.0 -0.04277 0.195772 0.838746 -0.048109 0.871987 -0.742368 -0.015387 -0.514291 -0.624052 -0.282499 2.07918 -0.246432 -1.127932 -0.552391 -0.73314 -0.355297 -1.023512 -0.906028 -1.017959 -0.324951 0.362961 1.734624 0.134344 0.891902 -0.445042 1.810735 -0.531882 -1.107939 -1.094039 -0.712165 0.181584 -0.102466 -0.246593 -0.459262 -1.084162 0.188989 0.348501 -0.603781 0.735972 1.177335 0.691253 0.373049 -0.505498 0.030703 1.92432 -0.340555 -0.010557 0.536792 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.65477 1.949419 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.334713 -0.422267 -0.652492 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.013601 5.038083 4.01427 5.051579 4.964504 4.033457,2233
well this is the first writing assignment of the semester .,you had said in our first meeting that we could write out a rough draft before we submitted this copy to you .,i figured that since this is a stream of consciousness writing that it would be best if this were written straight to you without proofreading or rewriting .,"well today i got back from visiting home for the labor day weekend , i 'm feeling really homesick right about now , i think it 's even worse than when i first left home for the first time to move to ut .","but i 'm sure as the week goes on , i 'll adjust again .","i think that as the year progresses and i visit more often , the coming back to school when the weekend is over will get a lot easier , because it will become i routine type of thing .","have you noticed that i 've started all the paragraphs , with the exception of this one , with the word `` well '' ?",i think that 's a word i use to start off thoughts that i do n't know how to start off .,"i do n't know if that 's good or bad , but who really cares , right ?",this is n't rhetoric .,"the first football game is this coming weekend , my first longhorn football game ever .","of course i 've seen games on tv , but being at the game is always better and more exciting .","just the like the san antonio spurs , i always watch them on tv , but being at the game is so much fun .",i just learned this weekend that someone from my graduating class is in my psychology class .,"this is n't a person that i ever talked to , in fact , i never even knew who he was until a good friend of mine started dating him .","i 'm guessing he saw me in the class when we first met last thursday , i did n't see him though , as you know , there are 540 people in that class .","last night as i was falling asleep , i started thinking about the homework that i need to get done .",then i started thinking about this writing assignment .,i could n't fall asleep because i could n't remember when this assignment was due .,"in my head i continuously thought , `` is it due the 15th or the 5th ?","'' of course , i 've always been this way , i always seem to contradict myself .","in elementary school , i would lay awake at night trying to remember if i had finished all the work that was assigned to me .",i would literally get up every night to check my backpack to make sure it was all finished and that i had put it all into my bag for the next day .,"i have a feeling i 'm going to be this way in college , my biggest fear is failing .","i know that if i work hard , i wo n't , but i ca n't help feel this way .","wow , has it been 20 minutes already , yes it has .",i got a class in 20 minutes .,"this was fun , got to go .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-1.3861 -0.38327 1.290982 -0.192147 -0.29975 -1.393666 0.258154 0.033083 -0.260371 -0.560153 -0.077929 0.472236 0.350442 0.645288 0.592903 0.0 -0.04277 -0.527303 -0.087055 0.434955 0.02528 0.751919 -0.826373 -1.185419 0.068895 0.977898 0.480725 0.705189 -1.015257 -0.615923 -0.646972 -0.54551 -0.789964 -0.369845 -0.65341 -0.140832 0.100366 -0.67489 1.140775 -0.25909 -0.305685 -1.177123 1.720827 -0.553421 0.227456 -0.859033 0.087292 -0.322102 -0.432039 -0.330442 -0.697946 2.749476 1.855804 -1.284338 -0.606525 -1.064842 -0.385896 0.68461 0.183181 1.290245 -0.25594 3.454407 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.71605 1.332357 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.459302 -0.37208 -0.337085 1.375731 0.620352 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.345493 4.89313 3.782245 4.62137 4.552437 4.495066,1091
"i think about my mother , my ex-boyfriend in houston ( of whom i 'm still in love with ) and just things that are going on in my life right now .",all of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming .,and for some reason during all of this i listen to the most depressing tori amos or sarah mclachlan song .,"after a good cry i always feel better , i think it 's healthy to cry though .",i think it 's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy .,"dealing with things , for me , is the best way to get over them .",but sometimes i tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out .,i seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when i would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me .,"my parents got divorced at that time , about when i was 11 years old or so .",i remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because i missed her .,she and i have one of the best relationships i 've ever seen between parent and child .,she is my friend not just my mother .,"but i do n't cross boundaries , i respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance .","i think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit , use it to their advantage , i just respect it and cherish it with all my heart .","i quote sarah mclachlan , `` and i have the sense , to recognize , that i do n't know how to let you go. `` i think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year .",we 've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other 's lives at some point or another .,"i guess it 's a good thing , he 's a wonderful person and a great person for me .","but i just do n't know if i can do this ( be in love with him have a relationship , what have you ) with him being in houston and me here in austin .","i do n't know if i want him calling me telling me how much he misses me , and telling me he loves me when he 's two hours away .","i guess it 's not that much of a distance compared to other people 's long distance relationships , but i think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those .",i certainly know they 're not for me .,"and from his past experiences with them , all bad , i know he 's not too keen on the idea either .","i miss him terribly , touching him , smelling him , his humor , his voice , everything .",e-mail and phone conversations do n't suffice .,i just got a new laptop and i wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and i hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing .,ugh !,"i hate this thing , but i really do n't i like having it to take to the library .",i just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do .,i 'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things .,they just do n't interest me that much .,i 'm much more of a trial and error person .,except when it comes to math basically because i do n't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out .,i want a formula there for in my face .,we 're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now .,it 's a total bitch .,i made three really cool friends in that class .,one of my friends tim i saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together .,"i wish he were cuter , he 's a really nice guy .",and i made these two other friends tracie ( same name as my best friend ) and stephanie .,"they 're both really cute , and tracie seems like she 'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with .",she was telling me about her cousin 's friend who 's gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion .,imagine that .,but i would love to go to new york .,"especially after seeing that movie a perfect murder , i mean i know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on central park but i would love to just go visit it .","i love the whole image of it , it 's just very chic for some reason .","i would live there if i could get a very high paying position somewhere , but that 's the only way i would .",it 's just too crowded otherwise .,

"i had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time i wanted to do it or remembered to do it , my boyfriend michael was in the room .",i did n't feel like i could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if i knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second .,i guess i knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time ; stuff that i did n't want him to know about .,he would kill me .,"not in the literal sense of course but in any case , he would be destroyed .",if i told him what i was thinking it would be the end .,i do n't want it to be the end .,"i 'm not saying i do n't want it to ( i 've got mail , and i really want to check it , but i 'm going to keep typing ) go on forever , but i love him enormously and if i told him that while he was",gone for an evening i slept in another guy 's bed and we ended up fooling around .,that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with michael .,"i 've always been big on honesty , but why ca n't i bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between damian and i ?",maybe because he 'd ask why and i 'd say that i 'm not even really sure why .,that 's a big problem with our conversations .,if he asks me why or what 's wrong ( he says `` what ?,"'' a lot ) i ca n't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then i usually ca n't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if i attempt to describe it , then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he 'll bring",it up later because he 's like an elephant .,he never forgets .,so i 'm still trying to figure out why ?,maybe i needed something exciting .,i 've known michael for years and we 've been dating for over 8 months .,"i was never really physically attracted to him , but only later i was because i loved him .",the first time i met damian i almost stopped in my tracks .,i do n't know why .,maybe it was because the first time i saw him was when i walked into a friend of a friend 's apartment ( he 's my friend 's friend 's roommate ) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop .,"after that night i could n't stop thinking about him and i heard ( dang it , why did n't i put an away message for my instant messenger .",that friend of mine that i was just talking about imed me but i told her i had 10 minutes left so i 'll talk to her later .,probably about this assignment and because we 've been discussing this damian issue ) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too .,the next time i went over there i did n't really talk to him much .,but the third time i was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there .,after that we started emailing each ( okay taking the towel off of my head .,"or maybe not , my hair 's not quite dry yet .",i 'll just unwrap it ) other .,"then the night two weeks ago that michael went to a concert , i went to damian 's apartment with my friend and we all hung out .",nothing too spectacular .,"i did n't intend on staying over but i developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night i was so sick that i could n't move , much less drive .",the guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so i would n't have to drive home and the rest is history .,i felt so guilty lying in bed with him though .,he had asked me if he could get in bed with me and i said yes .,i said yes .,i did n't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back .,i did n't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but i did n't pull away either .,"i was very still when he kissed my forehead , but i did n't tell him to stop there .",why did n't i ?,because i wanted it .,"but i have a loyal , devoted , loving , honest , wonderful boyfriend already .","why did i want this , or think i needed it ?",it was thrilling .,even though damian was a bad kisser .,it was like kissing a large mouth bass .,eventually i gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined .,it was n't really sexual .,for the most part .,this is making me sound horrible .,i probably am horrible .,"yeah , i am .",this was cheating .,"and by not telling him and by still communicating with damian via phone now and still email , i continue to be deceptive .",damian does n't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to london at the end of the year .,and i do n't love him .,i do n't really know him .,i 've hardly been around him except for three or four times .,we 've had two meaningful conversations .,the whole concept of a relationship with him is silly .,"yet i have n't been able to stop thinking about him since i met him and wondering about him , etc , etc .",i just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me ( just got out of the shower before i started this ) .,"my palms are kind of damp , not good for a laptop probably .","okay , it 's been more than 20 minutes so i 'll stop now .",i wonder why i wrote a confession of sorts .,and i wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this .,"i 'd better not save this , just in case michael finds it .",i 'm terrible ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

well its sunday night and i 'm just chilling in the room .,i 'm enjoying not having my roommate here .,it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone .,that 's what my roommate does .,instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day .,i guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever .,as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever i want then we have no problems .,last night was pretty fun .,i went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience .,i kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he was n't that good of a dancer because he could n't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways .,the funnest was on friday when me and kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party .,we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that i met at camp texas .,he was a counselor that i had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever .,i really did n't think anything of it at the time because i thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so i kind of kept my distance .,i e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me .,"he did , which was good .",i was hoping he would .,i think i kind of like him but i have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so i 'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it .,and plus he is the guy and i grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so i 'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started .,maybe that 's my problem .,when i want something i tend to let it come to me and i just wait around till something happens .,maybe i should go after the things i want .,"speaking of things that i want , i applied to be a texas lasso .",i got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview .,i was so excited .,i have wanted to join something like this ever since i got to campus .,"they do everything , from socials to community service .",i heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past friday .,he is an iron spike and he suggested i look into it because he thought i would enjoy it .,and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe i could be able to hang out with joe a little more but whatever about that .,i really hope i get in to this because i really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that i can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that,i have been recently hanging out with kayla who is one of the girls i met at orientation .,we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now .,that 's why i want to get involved in something of my own so i wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me .,that 's not what college is all about .,"its about having fun and enjoying yourself , not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate .",she is trying to get involved though .,she signed up for the rowing team so we 'll see how that works out .,it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat .,i 'm no one to judge .,i have got the music on my computer going and the tv so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while i sit here and type for twenty minutes .,i have like five minutes left so that 's good because i 'm kind of getting tired of typing .,"tomorrow me , kayla , and her roommate sheik are going shopping at barton creek mall !",i am very excited about that because i love to shop and i want some big sunglasses .,i have seen lots around campus and i want some of my own .,i really do n't want anything else but u never know once you get going .,i 'm a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because i will buy them and add to the collection in my room .,its going to be fun whether i get stuff or not because i just love shopping in general that 's why my major is retail merchandising .,i will get to shop for a major company like mace 's or nordstrom or even tiffany 's .,that is my dream .,i want to have a base office in new york city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company .,i want to eventually be head person because i do n't like being under someone else 's control .,but i know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe i will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams .,my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but i think not yet .,i do n't want to miss anything up here .,it is so much fun at college !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

okay so i was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed .,this was something that i really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and i seemed to have noticed a difference .,i first tried it out on reading a book .,"i realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what i was reading , as well as , getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about .",when listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and i kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion .,"i am listening to a dj named paul oakenfold who is a trance dj , and even as we speak i can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what i am writing .","yesterday , last night , actually i was doing some reading and i started to first listen to hip hop and i kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because i know a lot of them .",i ended up spending about 30 minutes and i got through about 12 or 13 pages which is incredibly slow .,after that i decide to try out some trance .,"i actually used to always listen to trance last year when i would read or study because i always helped my expand my mind when i was either designing things , reading , or writing .",so when i was reading i noticed that i was much more attentive to what i was doing and got a lot more than 13 pages read in a 30 minute time period .,as of right now i am trying out this trance thing again .,"the funny thing is , is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now .","the tv is on , my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework , and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book , and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies , not even",paying attention to the tv but to the work that we need to get done .,after thinking about this right now i am at 9 min 30 sec and i have already written a lot .,i believe that if i would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class .,"another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that i am talking about class related things , how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain ?",how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music ?,i mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together ?,or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body 's response system that makes you feel all numb inside .,"could this be another type of an anesthetic , but instead of a shot , gas , or gel , could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic ?",who really knows .,but anyway that i am sure has been looked at for a long time .,i really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me .,but right now i really do n't know what else i wamt to talk about because i am out of time ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.488318 -1.38596 -0.664079 -1.431194 -1.093916 0.851297 1.201024 1.2983 0.95468 -0.064101 0.028313 1.704946 -0.447664 0.493531 0.52109 0.0 -0.04277 -0.997189 -0.919316 0.681051 -0.786549 2.604836 -0.851962 -1.054433 -0.069694 0.696018 1.573404 0.240277 -2.16706 -1.479329 -1.100231 -1.430891 -1.854664 -0.906028 -1.017959 -1.109326 1.364464 1.951826 0.101995 -0.58528 -1.038726 -0.721116 0.963682 3.098104 2.547245 2.285618 0.79576 0.100351 1.285972 0.276096 -1.34699 0.039013 1.060567 -0.711253 -1.044105 1.449631 1.769154 -0.298706 0.126886 0.980505 -1.715404 0.888255 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.264306 -0.099808 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.530443 -0.37208 -0.115887 -0.422267 -1.491263 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.496136 4.631486 3.368333 4.623697 4.707928 4.879427,2114

life is so strange .,for instance today i saw someone who lives right next to me that i have n't seen since i was in my hometown .,i do n't get guys at all .,why is it that guys can act so uninterested and be so rude ?,"it 's strange because if a girl likes a guy she thinks about him and talks to her friends about him and ca n't wait to hear from him , but guys act like they could care less and do n't even call you for acouple of days and do",n't think anything of it .,why is that ?,when i have been talking to a guy and he does n't call me it makes me feel unwanted and i tend to get pissed off .,i miss my best friend in the whole world .,he is at rice and my friend and i went and saw him last weekend but ever since i saw him i have been missing him more because i guess i remembered how much he ment to me .,the whole thing with this guy i'vebeen talking to is that he does n't act interesting and because of it he makes me question myself and has caused me to be homesick and yern for letters and calls from my parents and all of my friends from back home .,it 's strange how certain things trigger you to feel a certain way .,i 've been eating a lot of sweet stuff today and i 've decided that once you 've tasted something sweet you keep craving more until you 're out of it or you leave the room .,"my roommate is nice , but she and i have a wierd relationship .","we get along fine , but she is n't what i would call a good friend .",that is one of the reasons i am never in my dorm room .,why is it that people can be so mean to eachother ?,i do n't like to be mean to other people especially if i do n't know them but there are peole out there who will be maen and not even care about it .,i also do n't get why friends think they should lie to eachother .,"as a friend you 're supposed to be there for someone no matter what , but if your friendis lying to you it makes it so much harder to forgive them once you find out .",some of my closest friends did this to me and now because ofit i do n't even associate with them .,i do n't understand why people feel theneed to drink all the time also .,who says that in order to have a good time we must drink .,"i met this guy yesterday at dinner who asked my friend and i if we drank and continued to tell us how stupid it was because as children we have fun and do things just because , but as adults we must get dunkk in order to have a good",time .,i have never felt that i could justify drinking and i still do n't .,"i have drank a few times but just as an experiment , not every weekend .",it is crazy to me the number ofpeople who drink on a regualr basis .,my friend at rice has been known to drink and that bothers me considerably because i do n't want to seem him get addicted or get hurt .,his father has a drinking problem and i worry that will have an effect on him .,my friend cassie is so sweet we have just recently become good friends and we have so much fun together .,she is one of those people who could care less what others thought so she just says `` hi '' to people on the street .,that 's one of the reasons i enjoy her so much is because she makes me feel like it 's ok to just be nice and friendly to everyone and not worry whether or not htey think i 'm crazy for doing it or not .,my mother get 's on my case about everything and nags me all the time .,"i know she 's just trying to look after me and keep me safe , and it does n't help that i 'm an only child but , sometimes i ca n't handle all of her questions and concerns .",i wish she 'd just relax and let me live .,do n't get me wrong she 's the greatest and i would n't change her for anything i just think it 's time to start seperating what she thinks i should do and what i want to do .,life is funny we go through it trying to make something of ourselve and live up to everyones standards when really we should just live up to our own and try and be happy and make some great friends along the way and hopefully help a fewpeople along the way,like yesterday i was walking and this guy in a wheelchair was trying to wheel himself up a hill and he was strugglinng .,somone asked him for help and he accepted .,more people in the world should just do little acts like that that help one person out so they do n't have to struggle so much ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"not as much concentration , nor as deep a thought .",i have always had a problem with being too easily distracted - like now i just lost my train of thought .,i try to think about too many things at once and i do not really have a choice about what i think .,when i was doin the pretesting i often found that if any question required any thought or recoolection at all i was drawn a blank at it .,i simply could not look deeply into what i saw .,i have related this problem to many possible sources - this is why i decided that i did not want to smoke marijuana .,it is also why i am thinking that i should not smoke .,it is possible that smoking could have a depressive effect on the mind .,"maybe i do not drink enough water , or sleep too little or too much .",there really is no way to know for certain .,"i should probably just lead the best life that i know how instead of the easiest , which is what i do .","i know there are things i need to get done , things that i do which are just wasting my time , and things that i know are just plain wrong but i always reason my way around these issues .",or rather i just stop myself from thinking about them .,it really can not be good to be like this - i am feeling like i inhaled a little too much glue - actually i am probably just using the computer too much .,by continuously focusing on an external source of entertainment right in front of me i feel that i am rotting my brain .,this assignment is not helping either because i am not allowed to stop and think about things -

okay i 'm writing this stream of consciousness things and it 's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she 's got this nasty head cold and i hope my typing is n't keeping her up god i wish people would n't pound their feet when they go,up and down the stairs i wonder if my computer was a bad idea when i decided to place it right by the window oh god i think i am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she 's laying back down again i wonder if i 'll,get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through i feel a little drainage in my throat i hope i 'm not catching my roommates cold oh god i hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it 's only 12:00 i never realized how hard,it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me i want to move it but i do n't want to stop writing thud somebody 's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh i ca n't stop writing because if i did it would,be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school i 'm looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm i was mildly planning on drawing up,a petition with the other girls in order to get one i was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god i ca n't wait to use the sorority koozie i got on bid day for some reason i,"do n't like flashing around and advertising the fact that i 'm in a sorority , not that i 'm not proud of my sorority it 's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my t-shirt i mean",i 'm no longer lindsey ( blank ) but i am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so i 'd rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it 's only 12:07,boy i 've never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self i wonder if i 'll be able to swing this college life i mean i want to do well so well so i can prove it to my mom that,i can do it yet i want to party a lot i know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because i still have n't attached the back part to my computer chair b ' c this task requires me to use some tool,"that i do n't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie , speaking of computers i put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am i proud it arrived in 4 foot","3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section , god my eyes are starting to get tired but i really have no reason to go to bed b ' c i have no classes before 12 and",i 'm not a morning person and i already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and i do n't want to be too tired to party because i 've risen before 10:00 am .,so i have many incentives to not go to bed and i feel like shit if i get more than 8 hours of sleep i 'm one of those always got to be busy people so i ca n't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it,"is sleeping late in the morning yet i feel like a slug if i sleep to late actually i feel guilty as if i 'm wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching , i 'm so proud","of myself that i am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that i 'm off to a good start see i just ca n't fathom how some girls i know are already missing class , i mean what the hell else do you have to do","here but occasionally study , party , and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade , but i should n't necessarily jump on a soap box because i never know how",long i will remain this disciplined .,kick ass it 's 12:18 and i 'm signing off !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"how to begin , i have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now i 'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why i feel this is a strange assignment o well i do n't smell",much right now but i hear the tv which i fixed last night i did a pretty good job even though i still have an extra screw left i 'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which i hate its 3 11 tonight,i 'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum i 'm glad i get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow i 'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the,competition will become harder the band is a neat experience i have always liked marching and now i get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun i have only been typing for 3 minutes this is going to be a long 20 minutes,"there is nothing i can do to make it go by quicker even if i type slower , no i 'm trying to find something else to think about , so i am disrupting my stream which is ironic that i have not really because i 'm on a new",one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end .,until now .,so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so i can start my weekend and maybe get some food i 'm very hungry now i have not eaten all day and i 'm hungry now i need to get some food,", maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely seems like that and cafeteria food is all i eat lately its not a very good realization drew just walked in the door he is my roommate he just asked how",i watch scooby doo its so mundane '' he uses vocabulary to impress people and i just wrote it in my paper to impress people .,very ironic as well john ridder died today he is the star on threes company and 8 simple rules and he died on set suddenly its a weird thing i would like to live a long life and maybe die suddenly tho and not have to know i 'm dying,"although i 'm not afraid to die i feel i have a place to go though , my afterlife is set many people here do n't believe in god and i do n't know why it seems to me to be the only answer we have not even figured out",the human brain and we dare to declare that there is no being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that ca n't stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways i have been trying to help people understand that christ came to give love,and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live i guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what i believe is imposing my culture on them which i guess could be true but i 'm not trying to break them,from their traditions i 'm just trying to .,"my roommate just started talking , `` arafat refuses to leave , and the usa is blatantly pro-israel .","`` no , if the us was blatantly pro-israel world war three begins .","i stopped following the conversation with california governors my roommates friend is here now and they are arguing politics , current affairs , the such , .","scooby doo caught the bad guy , i 'm satisfied now , man my fingers hurt and this writing is getting very tiring i wish i could be done now but i have to keep writing they are talking about proposition 12 now bla bla its very hard to concentrate",on two things at once but i guess that is what college is about my physics homework is next to me i 'm very glad i am understanding most of it i was proud of myself today because i finished most of my hw which is due next monday we,have an exam in two weeks and i think i will do very well i also have an exam in this class and i 'm very not prepared hopefully i can sit down and read through the text we will have to have read thus far and begin to see,what this class will teach me i also remember that i have to do some experiment hours for this class hopefully i will have some free time in the weekend ahead to do some of them i am beginning to smell food man i am so hungry i 'm not,thinking about much now because i am so focused on how hungry i am and what i would like to eat yet i 'm thinking about thinking about what i want to eat and so forth .,this assignment is very weird because you ca n't have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think,"about it the point is gone , the twilight zone is on now i love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 12 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues","of the time in them which is very good , i like them , i have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert myself , its weird how humans always need diversion and now when i ca n't even write my thoughts", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today is a bad day .,my boyfriend and i of 2 years just broke up because he is at another university and is rushing right now .,i have always been the center of his world and now he acts like he does n't even want to talk to when except for when it is convenient for him .,his roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me and when i first heard that i got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the restroom .,"jared , has been the ony guy that i have ever loved and i thought i would marry him .",we spend holidays together and i am already a part of his family and he is part of mine .,to think of him being with someone else just kills me and i am so torn up right now that i can not concentrate on anything but him .,i had to end it because i can not continue to be hurt when all i have done is devote my whole life to him .,he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had together .,my thoughts are horrible right now and i never thought that i could feel so hurt and ashamed .,my biggest fear is that he wo n't even care because he will just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other girls .,jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he was always worried about me forgetting about him .,"he was always the one that could n't stand not to see me for one day , and he was so in love with me tat sometimes i got annoyed by it .",now the tables have completely turned because i feel like i am incapable of functioning without him .,"for the past 2 years , everything has been about him and so now i just do n't know what to do with my time .","where do i even start without him there to say i love you at night , or without him there when i am having a bad day ?",this is the worse feeling i have ever felt and i just wish he knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day !,he will probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks .,"i helped him move into his new apartment and was not invited to come since , but all of our friends have gone over there and seen him , so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that position ?",i have not been real happy lately as it is because i just transferred to ut and i hate it so far .,"i do n't see anybody i know during the day and i feel so lonely without jared , and now it will be permanent .",this is the worse time for this to happen and it makes me feel sick when i think about how it probably wo n't change .,we have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now there is nothing perfect about us and all i feel is pain .,he is going to the school that i did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while i have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what i get for it !,i kept telling myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about him every day .,"i am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help me during down times like this , but they have never seen me like the way i am today .",i have seen other people hurt this bad and i just thought to myself that it must suck to be like that and now here i am in their shoes .,"he is the guy that has always put a smile on my face , made me feel loved and made me a better person .",i go to sleep at night thinking of him and i wake up in the morning thinking of him .,we have had problems before and after a few days he could n't stand fighting with me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad .,"i keep telling myself that if we do n't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me , but i have such a bad feeling that this time is different and he will just",move on .,"i do n't want to move on but i have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people because when i think about it too much , it tears my heart up .",this is the guy that i have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has already given me up .,we have all the same friends and i will not be able to hear about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until i start t feel better .,i have no energy and it scars me because i do n't even want ot do my homework of study because my mind is in such a different place right now .,he has put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting people .,it just kills me to think that i am here and he is there without me because i have always been included in everything he does .,now all of a sudden i am shut out and i hope he realizes that he ca n't live without me .,it is so hard for me to think of him with somebody else because i know everything about him and what he likes and does not and i do n't ever want another girl to be that close to him .,"i love jared so much and i wish he would n't have ever left or that i would have stayed there because things could be different right now , but he enjoys making me jealous when he talks about all the things he is getting to do .",i know that i must just live day to day knowing that things will get better but right now i ca n't see myself getting over this for a long long time .,"i feel worthless today , am i am a very good person so what did i do to deserve this ?",i am just hoping and praying that things can be patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is like without each other .,"i just do n't want him to throw everything away , because he is the best thing that has ever happened to me .",i talked to him this morning and all i could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as i do .,i am only wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if i will ever be on his mind because i usually know what he is doing all the time .,i am supposed to be the one who goes to these parties with him and i am supposed to be with him when he meets other poeple so they know that i am his girl and now all these girls that have been in love with him while we have,been together are going to love that we have broken up .,i am going on and on about how upset i am its just very hard because i had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being without him .,"and as for school , i hope it gets better it will just take some adjustments .",i hope jared still loves me as much as he always has !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i have so much on my mind right now .,it seems as if my world is changing in every way from every aspect .,i have been told by someone close to me ( my ex girlfriend ) that i have changed .,she will not tell me what she means or in what way i have changed .,it bothers me more and more all the time .,i ca n't see how i have changed .,i have looked at every aspect of my life and personality and have yet to find any feeling different than that which i felt three months ago .,i do n't want her to be upset with me .,i just wish she would tell me why .,i feel like i am continuously trying to make everyone around me happy .,i spend so much time being the listener of other people 's problems .,i just sit there and listen to them and when they want feedback i provide it to the best of my ability .,the only problem is that sometimes i want to talk to someone .,but people do not usually seem to have the same time for me .,i usually find my own way of dealing with things such as bowling .,bowling is great stress relief .,you challenge yourself only and get to throw heavy objects at other heavy objects to improve your score .,i am not a violent person at all .,but i do feel better after a few games of bowling .,i enjoy talking to people about things and helping them with their problems .,it just seems like there are a lot of problems out there for which i have no advice to give .,it 's as if i am letting them down .,i am somewhat worried right now .,mainly about what will happen when i finish this thought process .,i have to go to my fraternity house and help work on one of our pledge class 's projects .,i am tired and feel overwhelmed by what i have to do .,"i have schoolwork , friends , and fraternity .",any one of these could easily take all of my time .,yet here i am trying to budget all of it in .,"i realize that schoolwork comes first , but i do not want to give up my fun time .",i enjoy fraternity but it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time .,right now if i had one wish it would be for me to never need sleep again .,that would give me another 8 hours to get my daily tasks done .,i guess maybe i should think of some good things too .,life ca n't be all bad .,i have met so many new people since arriving at ut .,i have made friends with people whom i can already tell have the potential to be lifelong friends .,college has been like starting over .,i have friends who also came to ut .,but i rarely see them .,"and those who i did not get along with , i have yet to see thanks to the incredibly large campus .",this is probably one of the most interesting assignments i have ever one .,it has been a very long time since i simply sat down and wrote my feelings .,"in fact , this is the first time since i arrived at ut that i have had the opportunity to think about how i really feel .",i actually feel better knowing where i stand on some of the most important aspects of my life .,i will definitely make sure to read this again .,maybe in a day or so .,i might even do this assignment over again on my own in a week or so to see if and how my feelings have changed .,i need new shoes .,i stepped in a deep water puddle the other day and soaked them inside and out .,it is time for a new pair of shoes anyway .,i actually saw a student walking to class without shoes the other day .,i ca n't imagine walking down the streets of campus without shoes .,why am i thinking about shoes ?,what time is it ?,only one minute left .,i have really enjoyed this assignment .,i hope the upcoming writing assignments are as interesting as this one has been .,time is up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,2.010009 -0.829616 -0.380261 -0.789744 -0.275461 0.223748 0.348241 -0.042067 0.126392 0.159311 -0.192196 -0.104134 -0.371291 0.722179 0.433788 0.0 -0.04277 -0.180154 0.419006 -0.569766 0.28865 -0.084379 -0.433216 0.322574 -0.624052 -0.56099 1.59959 0.251563 -0.92909 -0.338847 0.230346 0.193547 -0.966611 0.667977 -0.750419 -0.75394 0.286131 -0.060518 0.026989 0.210551 -1.038726 -0.056721 0.250369 1.179855 0.698562 0.213312 1.506212 -0.121138 0.622798 -0.517623 0.081998 0.466461 0.214097 1.017182 -0.09479 0.330194 -0.083094 0.849873 -0.010777 -0.855371 -0.498084 1.253324 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.409342 -1.023325 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.085719 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.085322 0.410639 -0.154059 -0.776909 4.992927 4.132252 4.585486 5.111766 4.234423,1174
the reason for that is because of this girl i 'm interested in .,"this relationship has had a lot of problems , but nothing i can really do about it .",this girl is someone that my roommate dated last semester .,i was with her at the end of the semester and i felt that things were pretty good .,now my roommate still likes her and tries to make moves on her .,this guy is a real good friend of mine too .,because of this i do n't want to be serious about this girl .,"i think she really likes me , but then i feel guilty about what i 'm doing .",she 's the kind of girl that has a lot of guy friends .,i went to a club last night and she was there .,i was dancing with her and felt bad because my roommate was there also .,i felt so bad i sort of pushed her away whenever she got close .,during that night she also danced with my roommate and other guys .,all those guys danced real close to her which made me made me feel real sad .,"i do n't have the right to be jealous because we really are not together , but emotions are too hard to control .","i just wish i could hold her and be with her , but the situation is just too awkward .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.847854 -0.399464 -1.353123 0.100554 0.044813 -3.575788 -0.403264 0.861037 -0.190313 -1.677215 -0.157617 -0.590446 0.619836 2.076512 -0.254114 0.0 -0.04277 0.612785 -0.116198 -0.091627 -0.147272 -0.742368 2.33988 -0.34173 -0.624052 -0.025297 -0.177569 -0.99949 1.096607 0.755329 0.974075 -0.417923 0.792602 -0.906028 -0.183794 -0.001267 1.035896 1.7683 0.12686 0.069949 2.315978 -0.942434 -1.343017 0.486881 -1.429535 -1.542652 4.310254 2.253264 -1.817532 1.690284 4.593608 0.197616 1.822235 -0.89195 0.176915 -0.772626 -1.328483 -0.954251 3.367907 0.542272 1.271178 0.179227 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.060292 -0.513384 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.361888 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.62831 5.152501 3.946527 4.644632 4.358925 4.445511,388
"i mean , each day i wonder why i am here on this earth .","and then other times , i wonder why i go through some of the stuff i do go through .","it seems at times that the `` good '' people get the worst parts of life , while the `` villains '' in life seem to get the better things in life .",that bugs the hell out of me .,then there is love .,something that is near and dear to me .,i look around and i see great females who choose to stay in relationships with guys who treat them like `` scum '' .,it 's so ridiculous sometimes .,"the worst is when these girls as for the nice guy , but when one comes along , they ignore him and guy for the guy that may boost their social status .",sometimes i guess the girls out there that are like that deserve the treatment they get .,"other than , life seems great right now .",every piece of the puzzle is here .,except one thing .,i have no one to wake up for each morning .,"but other than that , thing seems to be falling into place .",i use to be a person that required love and what comes along with it .,"but after my last relationship , i have learned to take life a lot easier and just `` chill '' .",sometimes i might take it to an extreme and therefore i do get myself in trouble or do things that make me disappointed in myself .,i worry that this new `` care-free '' life may eventually take me over with it 's great appeal .,but only time will tell if that will happen .,"most of my close female friends feel that i have changed to a more fun and loose person , but at what because ?",some feel i have already changed too much and have become a totally different person .,"i do see myself as changing , but the core of who i am has not changed and hopefully it will never change .",i feel that my beliefs and morals and etc are still the same .,"i have changed a few beliefs , or i should , i am considering changing a few beliefs i have , but it 's nothing to strong .",it 's more like how i choose to take life and what i think is important .,but some of the beliefs that i am considering changing or what has my friends worried .,"because once again , they feel i may become a totally new person and become a person without the same sympathy that i use to possess .","but like everything else in life , only time will tell .",but i see my myself as evolving rather than changing .,make sense ?,it 's like i am becoming a stronger person .,especially emotionally .,i am still as sensitive as i used to be .,tears come natural for me .,but as far as love and stuff .,it 's not as blinding as it used to be .,it 's like i gained `` sunglasses '' somehow as i evolved .,even my poetry has changed with my evolution .,my first couple of works were specifically about love and what goes along with it .,"but my most recent collection focused on death , suicide , and the afterlife .",i was n't at all suicidal or anything .,but the artistic side of me wanted to try something different from the usual love stuff .,"but it seems through everything i do , that i have matured .",i am less likely to hold grudges than i used to .,"i have pretty much become friends with most , but not all of my past `` grudges '' .","i guess once you get out of high school , things you once considered important seem ridiculous now .",kind of odd huh ?,"there were people in high school that i would have died for and would have died for me , but now we barely talk .","and then there 's the people i never talked to much , but now i spend most of my time with .",it 's weird how one summer can change so much .,but i guess this past summer `` weeded '' out the friends who were n't really friends .,the friends you have now are the ones that will stay true to you for awhile .,or at least until something catastrophic occurs .,"i remember in high school , i thought my click would never break up .",we were almost like brothers .,but now we are like strangers .,maybe time will change things back .,or maybe it was just meant to be .,"but as of now , my life seems to be a constant vacation .","yea there is classes and stuff , but everything is so laid back .",there is no pressure whatsoever .,not yet at least .,but we 'll have to see how all that goes .,life is a mystery and i doubt anything will ever make sense .,"just take whatever opportunity you get , and never postpone anything until tomorrow .","cause you never know , there may not be a tomorrow .",and one should always keep their mind open to anything .,the most sure people in our world have changed their minds .,sometimes our past or the facts that are presented to us can alter our opinion on matter .,"however , it 's okay to have a strong belief about something as long as you believe in it with you heart and nothing more .",a lot of people today are just followers .,they believe what they are told .,they do n't think for themselves to see if what they are told makes any sense whatsoever .,many cases in history have resulted badly .,look at world war 2. the entire country of germany followed the madman named hitler .,"he was a lunatic , but one has top give him credit for being able to convince a whole nation that he was right .",then to convince them to allow him to be dictator .,"the sad thing is that , that could still happen today .","maybe not with the same `` material '' , but if a person said the right thing with the right motivation , any country could fall .",even the supposed `` untouchable '' u. s. a. nothing is untouchable .,just like how nothing lasts forever ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

for some reason today i feel more home sick than i have yet .,"when i first arrived to my dorm room three weeks ago , it did n't feel very real to me .","of course i cried when my parents left , but it was n't because i was feeling all the things that i thought i would .",at the time i think it was more knowing that i would soon feel that way once the excitement wore off .,"now , dorm life is very real and i no longer feel like i am at summer camp .",the first two weeks were nothing but meeting new people and going new places and now i feel the overwhelming feeling of college work and homesickness .,"it is rather silly i guess for me to say `` homesick '' because i am only thirty miles away from home , but i have discovered that it does n't really matter what your distance from home is .","distance would make it harder , but for all of us it is the fact that we are no longer living with our families ; we will never be living under our parents permanently .","in a way i guess i am supposed to be really excited about that and i think i am , but i also really miss being a bigger part of their lives .",so much happens on a daily basis and i feel like i am missing something .,i also wonder if it is really weird for me to feel this way .,"so many of the other students seem to be having the time of their lives , but i wonder if they have ever felt the same way .",i went to eat with my mom and sisters last night because my older sister was in town from college station .,after we ate i could n't fight the tears that were welling up in my eyes .,i miss old times like that and i miss the way we could just laugh together and have fun .,i know that soon i will be adjusted to my new life and i can look back on this and think what a dork i was .,it is just that time of adjustment and waiting until this place feels like home .,i want so badly for it to feel like home and i want to be happy here .,"i really have no doubt that it soon will be a place where i feel comfortable , i just hope that soon comes really soon !",my mom keeps sending emails telling me to have fun .,it is n't that easy to just make friends and go have fun .,"i never thought that it would be so hard to meet people , but with such a huge population it ca n't be easy .",i think that i am probably complaining too much because i really am not unhappy by any means but i just expected something different .,high expectations are dangerous because nothing can ever be as good as you dream it to be .,"oh well , hook 'em horns !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.004752 -0.822748 0.751483 -0.593593 0.003699 -0.147409 0.147007 -0.732843 -0.475474 -0.635886 -0.066157 -0.590446 0.303149 1.576588 -0.405069 0.0 -0.04277 0.304785 0.078077 1.443266 0.471037 -0.120934 -1.067034 0.883333 -0.624052 -0.759239 -0.832128 -0.032767 0.685916 -0.143702 -0.157739 -0.050119 1.387537 -0.348568 -0.259928 3.925306 0.857297 0.401334 1.285813 0.848921 -0.276596 0.242083 0.231075 2.040845 -0.568163 -0.831905 4.63548 -0.383955 0.19913 -0.59437 -0.67219 0.872588 0.084404 0.298236 1.995946 0.069761 -0.678311 0.749644 0.058081 0.830552 -0.772722 -0.387415 -0.480161 -0.196623 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.788748 -0.397696 -0.073676 0.880424 -0.607823 0.130114 -0.337085 0.512406 -0.839672 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.05473 4.366429 4.331555 4.626734 4.642979 4.260901,1292
why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty and unimportant things ?,it seems as though when we leave the mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all the more important .,when my roommate and i went shopping at the galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present .,girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money onto daddy 's credit cards .,have many teens forgotten about the value and importance of money ?,i also this weekend began to wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and homophobic .,my new friend kenny happens to be fixated on getting dates'girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes him .,the entire time at the mall kenny asked my roommate and i if random people were hotter than he was .,this relentless insecurity and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining .,why ca n't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy at that ?,society 's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and relationships .,most people seek relationships on all levels with people who share the same interests and personality traits that support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that they themselves may not think on their own .,why is love and relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen 's life .,i myself have realized recently that i 've spent a great many years in relationships loving someone and being loved in return .,"we as a society place so much emphasis on dating , relationships , and marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at such goals .",i mean look at the fixation that many college age individuals have on dating shows .,in high school many an ap calculus class were spent discussing elimidate and the trashy or sexy guys'girls that were on the particular episode .,"i myself admit to watching the trash , but for some reason society has aimed my eye to these sort of shows .",since i arrived on campus dorm life has truly agreed with me .,i worried for months that my roomate would be just dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common .,"fortunately , my roommate and i have a great deal in common and are turning out to be great friends .",the university has also provided me with many unexpected opportunities .,"besides the rec center , i 'm signing up for rock climbing , the music school has turned out to be unexpectedly positive .",i have played the violin since i was 8 years old .,in the past year i have realinzed that i genuinely desired to teach music in elementary school .,when i arrived at ut on the first day of school i was terrified of auditioning for the ut symphony orchestra .,when i arrived outside of professor noe 's office i was greeted by many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me .,my nerves seemed to overwhelm me as i walked in the room .,all i could think about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me .,i felt that the audition went well but i was forced to wait the entire weekend for the results .,as it turned out my audition had gone as well as i had felt .,i was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st violin section .,i ca n't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting people .,"alas , i have to go to work and spend my entire weekend hosting , babysitting , and waiting tables .",hopefully everyone will come home from college on friday so we can catch up on all the new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other 's company ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired .,i could n't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see .,i have 20'20 vision right now but that does n't mean that i 'm a good driver .,i have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks .,two weeks ago i went to dallas to go see my friends in a band and i ended up staying in waxahachie until 8 in the morning .,when i was coming home the next day i stopped and got coffee before i headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later i dozed off .,i had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile .,i ca n't believe i keep doing that .,it is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree .,"my dad called this weekend , which is odd considering he just decided to flee last christmas and not tell anyone where he was going .",he said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure i was ok. i 'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream .,the reason why i wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird .,if he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too ?,maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future .,just kidding .,ok well here is the countdown .,i only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me .,ok my time should be about up now .,yeah ok i 'm done .,the end !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"you know , being in a relationship is great .",and i absolutely love college .,but i have discovered that it is really hard to put the two of them together .,"i mean , jason and i have been together for about 8 ' monthssmall on the grand scale of things , i know , but it seems like an eternity .","in fact , i find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before jason .","he is , after all , my first real serious relationship .",and i do n't know .,"i mean , yeah , he is my first relationship , and yeah , it is a relationship from high school , but it is so damn hard to keep what we have in college .",i love him .,i mean really love him .,he says that he is n't sure if what he feels is love .,"i think that if you 're in love , then you know .",so that means that he probably does n't love me .,we 're lopsided .,"so that kind of sucks , but i deal with it , you know ?","i mean , sometimes it gets me down because when i say , `` i love you '' i do n't hear one back .","so , i get depressed .",but he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and i guess that 's enough to suffice .,"maybe sometimes i feel like i just have enough love for the two of us , but other times i become really doubting .",maybe i do n't love him either .,"i mean , maybe he 's righthow do you know what love really is ?",how do we know that love even really exists ?,how do we know ?,"i mean , yeah , there are songs , books , and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity .",but how do i know that it 's not just a really big `` like .,`` ?,"i mean , maybe that 's all i have for jasona really big like .",that makes me think .,"because , if it is just a really big like , then where did all of this `` love '' stuff come from ?",do i say that i love him because it 's my first real relationship and i just do n't really know any better ?,am i really just enamored with him because he was my first ?,is the fact that i 'm questioning it at all mean that it is n't

wondering where he is or what he 's doing or wondering if he 's wondering about me .","but , it 's like deep down , i know that he 's not .",he does n't feel about me the way that i feel about him

than that of which he feels .","logical , right ?",i did n't think so either .,i guess i 'm just confused .,most guys are n't as confusing as jason .,"actually , for the most part , he 's a pretty straightforward kind of guy .",but he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him .,"i mean , i 'm always wondering `` ok , he says he 's fine .","but does that mean that he 's really ok , or does that mean that he 's still upset but does n't want to tell me ?",'' i mean i secondguess myself all of the time with him .,i have a really low selfesteem when i 'm around guys .,"i 'm tall , so i always think that guys do n't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter , cuter girl .","i mean , jason is in a frat and he does n't want me to go to parties with him .",that really hurts my feelings .,"i feel like it 's because of a lot of reasons , but the main one being that i 'm not pretty enough for him to `` show me '' to his brothers or whatever .","also ,

death or some one moving away for you to realize that .,i did n't .,i would give anything right this second to talk to my grandma .,anything .,or to be able to have my best friend who is that the naval academy just give me a hug .,but no i wasted a lot of time .,but busy busy busy bee .,maybe if i was n't so busy and did n't get so involved i would have time .,but it is so hard to say no .,it is hard to not get involved .,especially in college .,everybody needs you !,they all want you to join their organization !,there are just too many and not enough time !,but you know i guess if you did n't do anything and then you would have excess time you would complain about being bored and wish that you had more stuff to do during that time .,so is there ever a happy medium .,i thought that when i got to college i would have more time .,i did n't have to be in class all day and i do n't have as much going on but i was wrong .,time is still the same here .,so now when i am out of school i will have more time ?,right ?,why do i have the feeling that once again i will be let down and time will still be as short then ?,i will have more stuff to keep me busy .,a job and maybe a family and then

think that if you really wanted it you could .,but i think that if you really want anything that you could .,i do n't like when people say they ca n't .,i think that is just not a good word .,maybe i am just stubborn and always like i think i can i think i can !,but is n't it much better going through life being like i think i can then i ca n't .,how would that be a way to live life ?,what kind of

side of life then be like this sucks , i hate this , i am miserable , i hate this , everyone feel sorry for me , and just be blaaaaahhhh .",that just does n't sound like a good way to live life in my

just write out what i am thinking more often .,i kind of like this .,i have no idea what i just typed but my mind is clearing .,maybe if my mind were n't so busy i would have more time ?,that could be a good idea .,i gave my self a great idea !,wahoo i am excited !,but this does feel nice to just get all those thoughts out .,i miss having my best friends to get those thoughts out to .,maybe just because my thoughts do n't ever make sense to me but they could some how always just tell me what i was thinking .,"i mean not that they were like this is what you are thinking but more that they were like , well i can relate to that by this experience and that is when you are like yes !",that is what i am talking about .,that is a great feeling .,when someone can help you figure out what you are thinking !,wonderful !,we should do more of that helping people figure out what is on their mind .,maybe it just makes sense to them .,kind of like the whole thing how do i know that they color blue

"as of right now , i 'm pretty happy with my life .",the only thing that i question are relationship issues .,"after breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 6 months ago , i have n't dated any other person .",i think i 'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend '' lifestyle .,"the girls i have met as friends i might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they were n't , again because i missed having a girlfriend .","recently , i 've gotten over the issue a bit .",i 've spent time with all my friends .,"that 's the good thing about being single , you have more time for your friends .","when i was going out for my ex , which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years , i did n't have much time for friends .","not only that , but i chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends .","this issue of mine , it 's made me a bit more self conscious .",i got the idea in my head that looks really do matter .,"seriously though , having a `` deep '' relationship is important and yadda yadda , but i really do feel that looks matter too .",a friend and i were discussing this .,she is been there for me a lot .,"when i broke up with my ex-girlfriend , she was there for me to complain to .","anyways , she said that looks do n't matter and it only matters a small percentage of time .",i argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that 's what matters at the very beginning .,i met this very interesting girl this summer .,her name is serena .,"she was telling me about her past , how she was somewhat of a `` geek '' in high school .",she did n't care about her looks or anything .,"she is a very bright girl , very deep .",likes art and many things most girls just do n't take interest anymore .,"she said that she realized she felt she had to start dressing up to attract people first , then and only then would they be able to see the `` real '' side of her .",i completely agree with this .,there is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow .,"ever since then , i 've gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features .",i never did care about it much .,i was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others did n't really enter my mind .,"during this recent period , i 've started to lift weights a bit and work out my body .",another thought of relationships i 've always wondered is at what point do you really have to `` settle '' ?,the reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl .,"when you date someone , how far into the future should you consider ?","unfortunately for me , i should 've realized in my last relationship that there was no future .","instead , because of my fear of being alone , i stayed with her .",for nearly 3 years .,"it was fun and all , but we had many arguments .",the reality was we were two different people .,"two different backgrounds , interests , ideas , practically everything .",my parents did n't like her because she was n't chinese and was n't very bright .,( i 'm chinese by the way ) .,i 'd like to talk about my family for a second .,"i was born in taiwan , and moved to the usa when i was four .","thus , i speak'write fluent english but can only speak chinese ( mandarin ) since i still speak it at home .","i would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional , which i really like .","like most chinese families , my parents stressed educational when i was growing up .",sometimes i think this is why there is the stereotype of `` asians being smarter in school '' .,"i think it 's because traditionally , chinese families stress education a bit more than others .","the bad thing about growing up in a `` traditional '' family is that living in the usa , i did not experience certain american family activities .","my dad never took me fishing , camping , or anything `` fatherly '' .",i think that was one of the things i really disliked about him .,"growing up , i always favored my mom more .","now that i 'm in college , i talk to my dad a lot more when i go back home , including cars , sports , politics , etc .","going home , i 'm spoiled with food .",my mom is always thinking i 'm going to starve to death .,"everytime i come back up to austin , she makes me bring a whole bunch of food .",my grandparents ( dad 's side ) also lives very close to me in houston .,"my grandparents came to the usa a couple of years before us , which is how we were able to .","i remember growing up and laying awake at night , my biggest fear in the world was that i 'd lose my grandpa ( to old age ) .",it 's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever .,"we 've tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him , but he just wo n't .","he says he has nothing better to do during the daytime , and to let him enjoy it .",he is even said something close to `` i 've already experienced everything in life .,my family is doing good .,"i have nothing else to live for '' now , do n't take this to be a suicidal comment for anything , he was saying it as if it were wise words .","on my part , its hard to argue with him .",he is my grandpa and i ca n't really tell him to just stop what he likes so much .,"personally , i have a very big problem with talking to people .",this problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college .,"since there are so many people around , it 's hard to not get use to it .","when i 'm around people , i 'm always worried that what i say will make them think negatively of me .",that 's why i 'll usually always rethink what i want to say in my mind before i actually say it .,"funny thing is , my chinese name translated to english is `` brave speaker '' .",i know i have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but i just ca n't help it .,"growing up i did n't have that many friends , so i thought to myself a lot and that 's still true .","around strangers , i 'm really quiet .",only around friends am i a bit more active .,and my 20 minutes are up .,this was pretty useful .,glad i could type out what i was thinking .,now i got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book .,the lectures are much more interesting ., , , , ,

right now i just sat down to type this psychology paper .,"this is the first time i have ever typed a paper like this before , with constant writing .","i am used to gathering my thoughts , thinking before i speak but now i am writing whatever pops into my mind .",i am thinking about how much this different from something i would do in high school ; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing .,"i am hearing the faint sound of the houston astros baseball game in the background , i love baseball so much , this the pennant races are incredible .",hopefully i will get to broadcast the game i love in the future .,"well i have an hour until its time to go to work , its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college .","astros , i think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out .","i 'm enjoying the fact that i am able to do this from my own computer , god i would hate to live in a dorm .",sharing and small places are no fun for me .,"looking forward to this weekend , big barbecue put on by my friend mike ; we always have legendary times at those .","its just starting to sink in now as i hear god bless america in the background that today is september 11. it 's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago , it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago .","i really do n't agree with what is going on in our country right now , by the way .","the wind is blowing pretty good outside right now , for some reason i have not opened the blinds in the house yet .",i get really lazy when i am at home .,"anyway , this a little easier than i thought it would be .",it has really gotten me thinking .,"i mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking , and are we thinking about something all the time ?",consciously ?,"well i think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2 , i really hope we do n't lose to milwaukee .","man i do n't want to go to work today , although 4-9:30 is not that bad , better than 12-9:30. i feel like i am writing in a journal more than doing a project , that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the",page .,big props to the person who set that up .,"i was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment , but i quickly realized that was not necessary .",i just found out i have discussion section class for geography .,i do n't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section ?,"i do n't get what that is all about , is it for the ta 's to feel important or something ?","must be a college thing , i guess .",it seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now .,i just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that i have about a minute left .,"i hope i did alright on this , i mean i wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts .",p. s ( i submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.233996 0.066494 0.069308 -0.01826 -0.559545 0.580562 0.839172 0.894688 1.064028 -0.32538 -0.119604 1.04912 0.522342 -0.584519 1.28873 0.0 -0.04277 -0.855061 -0.457121 1.955208 0.044223 -0.207892 -1.466104 -0.376255 0.615213 1.664798 0.58846 1.217704 -0.514285 0.17266 0.520984 0.15252 -0.919942 -0.906028 -0.69198 -0.243301 -0.517483 -0.520246 0.410045 -0.79235 -0.383242 0.106856 -0.9365 -0.566183 -0.688696 0.291222 -0.389587 -0.821518 -0.330846 -0.683429 -0.476429 0.785547 -0.105598 -0.123072 -0.966819 1.077844 0.673479 2.709414 -0.263529 0.106259 -1.187024 0.833583 1.593789 0.198427 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.593967 0.381748 0.262444 1.683221 0.664471 -0.37208 0.651887 -0.422267 -0.853924 0.598966 -0.098422 -0.297995 4.207836 3.812751 4.652857 4.399011 4.930799,2056
i feel kind of strange doing this assignment like this -- i do n't think i 've ever had such an informal assignment .,i just got off the phone with this girl that i met in galveston when i was a junior in high school -- the whole time i was talking i was also thinking about how i wanted her to shut up so i could do this assignment .,"well , anyway , here i am sitting before this crt not really concentrating or doing anything special -- just king of chilling .",my roommate is playing quake on his computer on the other side of the room -- also the radio is on and so it makes it king of hard to concentrate with all the noise in the room .,i think the artist on the radio is natalie merchant -- damn i really hate her music -- it 's so poppy it 's disgusting .,"everything the drums to guitars to vocals sounds so devoid of feeling or meaning -- it 's a mind numbing , spirit-crushing experience listening to this crap .",i just wish she would shut up .,i prefer bands like korn or pantera .,"they sing with so much feeling , and all the songs are sung with vehemence and anger and lust and disgust and hatred .",the entire spectrum of emotions is explored in their works .,"other favorite bands of mine are helmet , alice in chains , pearl jam , etc .",i guess i kind of got caught up in the whole alternative revolution phenomenon .,i wore flannel and had ripped up jeans and doc martens and i even did the drugs that went along with the whole alternative scene .,a big mistake in my opinion because those vices with which i experimented last their taboo and so now i have no fear of them and would have no qualms about taking them other than the fact that they destroy your body and mind .,now i only drink -- another result of my experiments with `` alternatives '' .,it 's funny because in high school i was a drugger and an `` alterna-teen '' when i was wishing that i could be a musician .,but now that i am one -- i have my own band -- i do n't really feel the need to do live the alternative lifestyle .,i do n't dress strange or have strange habits .,i have a 4 .,"0 gpa and was the valedictorian of my high school , so that kind of belies some of the things that i 've said here .",better man by pearl jam just came on the radio .,i like this song alot .,pearl jam 's not as good as they used to be .,"their albums ten , versus and vitalogy are much better than the album no code in my opinion .",no code seems so sterile and not pearl jam .,i think it has a lot to do with the fact that they have a different drummer -- the old drummer from the red hot chile peppers .,he sucks in comparison to dave abbruzzese -- the old drummer for pearl jam .,i wish they would put out another awesome album .,if they did i would be very happy .,"oh yeah , my roommate just reminded me about this girl that i know .",she 's a fat girl and she 's kind of a bitch .,"she keeps calling me and calling me , but i do n't want to talk to her because i do n't like her 'that ' way at all -- but she likes me like that .",i kind of like living in jester because it is very close to everything that goes on campus .,"the food sucks really badly , but there are plenty of beautiful girls that live here -- -so that is really cool .",i just glanced at my watch because i am timing my time here on this assignment .,i only have a few more minutes to do this assignment .,i just thought about how delicious my supper was today at my friend drew 's uncle 's house .,we had badass barbecue and he gave us beer and margueritas .,he was a really cool guy .,i want to go back there sometime and hangout again .,he 's got a really nice house and he 's building a studio for recording .,that will be cool .,maybe my band-the goodside-will be able to make use of this to record some stuff in there .,we have our own studio but it 's in the dorm room so it 's not really easy to record all the time in there because you 've got to take into account other peoples ' sleeping habits and wants and needs -- that 's another thing that suchs about,the dorms .,it kind of cramps the lifestyle of someone who makes a lot of noise .,"well , i 've gone over my twenty minute minimum , so i 'll go ahead a start reading for other classes .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"it 's only the second week of school , actually the first full week and i 'm already so stressed out from studying .",i 'm not sure exactly how to study but i 'm learning .,i think maybe i should just make study guides so that 's what i 'm doing .,"oh my gosh , i got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night , trueluck 's .",it was so good and i had such a good time .,this past saturday i wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in waco to eat .,it did n't happen but in the long run i 'm glad because i finally made some friends .,i 'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys .,though this does n't much help my boyfriend 's peace of mind .,i 'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever .,"anyway , well i met these really cool guys who i really like hanging out with .",sometimes i do n't think ashley likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks i 'm wrong to hang with guys because i have a boyfriend and so does she and well we 're just really different .,"well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we 'd go , i think ashley only said yes because she had been drinking .",well i had so much fun and the guy i went with turned out to be really nice .,it was great to finally go out and do something with people .,i feel more at home now .,now to my boyfriend .,we were best friends for 2 years before we even thought about dating .,i love him so much and although i 'm only 18 i pretty much believe he 's the guy i 'm suppose to be with when i get married .,but my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him .,i understand that he 's back home and doing the same things he 's done for 3 years so he does n't have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as i do but before we never argued and now he 's always mad at me about,something .,he makes me feel awful when i go out and i know he does n't mean to but it happens .,he ca n't understand where i 'm coming from .,the guy i dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty .,i want to have fun here without knowing that he 's at home mad or crying .,he 's not the crying type of guy so i just do n't understand .,"i love him more than anything and he should realize that , that is all that matters .",no other guy here will ever take his place but that does n't mean that i wo n't make other guy friends and go out with them .,i do n't even look at guys the same way because of brent .,my life here does not mean that what i feel in my heart is suddenly going to change .,i just wish that he would go back to being the same brent as before i left but i know that it is going to take time and i just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he 's making me feel .,it 's a compromise situation but i think everyone should have to go through this because if we 're still together in the long run i know our relationship will be just that much stronger .,i 'm going home this weekend and i ca n't wait finally i can show brent that my feelings for him are the same and i get to see my mom and sister .,i have to go to my dad 's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and i 'm not really looking forward to it .,i want things to go back to normal with my family .,the way it 's suppose to be .,if there is such a thing .,the months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times i 'm glad i 'm here and away from all of it .,at least i do n't have to listen to the screaming and fighting .,i wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something .,but she 's being stupid .,i miss my sister so much and my dog tinker .,my sister and i are so close we might as well be twins so i hate being away from her ., , , , , , , ,

watch them .,i really have been missing football .,i ca n't believe i have n't even been to the longhorns games .,i watched their games more when i was n't even a student here .,i guess i got so

having a graduation party at la villita .,i knew i had to go since i was so close to her family for so long .,her mom was my coach .,i still call her coach .,"anyways , analissa promised that there

too rowdy downtown .","so i left with my best friend , but i felt really bad that i lied to her family , because her mom was thanking everyone who showed up to the party despite the fact that the night would go down in spurs history .",she said that we were anie 's true friends .,ouch .,"so rae ann and i walked downtown to different smoky sports bars trying to find a decent place to watch the

n't mind me using her computer , cause i still have n't gotten mine yet .","back to my story , i watched my game and we won of course and it was one of the happiest and adrenaline-running moments of

i do to fix the problem ?,should i just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time ?,or will this be a chronic thing ?,im in a bind because i do n't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her .,i do n't want her to think i 'm not attracted to her .,"god , i ca n't wait to see her !","she lives in dallas still , she 's a year younger , so i can only go back in

"well , apparently i 'm supposed to just type for 20 minutes .","being that it is september 11 , i suppose it would a good topic .",everywhere i look i see something about 9'11 .,even the clock at ut is stopped at 7:46. all of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 9'11 .,"the first thing i did this morning was turn on the television , almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 9'11 .",why ?,so i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else .,it 's almost a sense of deja vous or something .,( i do n't speak french ) .,i really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though .,i sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers had n't collapsed .,would everyone be okay less 500 people ?,i 'm really ready to see us attack iraq .,iraq is just a big problem .,"i 've always carried myself with little opinion because why should i , me , say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be .","i do n't know much , all i know is what the news tells me .",how can anyone say we should n't attack iraq ?,"if we do , i am confident that it was the right thing to do .","people just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do , we 'd probably say the same thing .",these new what if america was n't america ?,commercials are really fascinating .,i find them very effective .,"i mean , a man goes to the library , and wants to find some books , it does n't even matter the topic , and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested .",i never really thought about that .,"i mean , i can go to the library , pick up a book on atomic bombs , check it out , and no one asks a word .",it 's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned .,that 's pretty cool .,"actually , my favorite commercial related to 9'11 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are , and they say : terrorists goal is to change the way of life of america or something like that , and then it",shows the next day us flags hung all over the building and says they succeeded .,that is just a cool commercial .,i remember when there used to be flags everywhere .,now you 're lucky if you ever see them .,i guess that 's not natural to be so patriotic .,i think we saw so many flags because we needed to be reminded that we all have something in common and we need to stick together .,the news is starting to get on my nerves finally .,"what is really weird is me , probably like many other people , were wondering what today would be like .",would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison ?,i even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more .,what happens ?,"everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 9'11 in their thoughts , but refuses to let it take them down .",it seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that .,for a while after 9'11 i was pretty scared .,i wondered what was going to happen .,i almost did n't even want to be in the country .,"but then , when thinking about what i 'd be giving up , i realized that even if the us is under attack , it 's still the best country in the world .",now they are doing the i am an american commercial .,they are analyzing how the different people say it .,makes me wonder how i would say it if i were to be on tv .,"would i say it proudly , or with anger in voice ( toward the terrorists ) , sadly , or just normal .",the different tones were amazing .,i never looked that much in the to the commercial until now .,wow .,"i bet now most people would say it proudly , but what about a week after the attacks ?","would you not say it with pride , yet more sorrow .",there is just a huge amount of commercials on tv that deal with this situation .,"although commercials are effective , i feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music .",music is so powerful .,"you know , when you 're hearing that god bless the usa or america the beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits .",similar to church i suppose .,whenever i 'm at church i get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved .,that 's exactly how i feel when i hear those patriotic songs .,"well , i suppose in many ways , god was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing .",the sunday after 9'11 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches .,i know i was at church .,everyone just needed to hear something good .,i do n't really worry about that stuff anymore .,i figure it 's like worrying i 'm going to get the red nile virus or whatever .,"i mean , they act like it 's the terrible virus but it has n't even killed 20 people .",heat kills more people than that .,let 's go worry about heat now .,"no need to worry so much anymore , it is time to enjoy life .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

he probably wo n't graduate because he smells too he and bevo ought to share a bathroom .,he used to have a shaved head and a little horn on top .,which reminds me of the dumbest thing he 's ever done when he worked at a video store and stole 12 porno movies .,his parents are head of the christian mission church or something and they were kinda mad .,he has no scruples he had to pay 180 dollars for those movies and he wanted to watch them at my house .,"doubt it i do n't steal from video stores and i will not agree to his stealing them either , but i did watch this movies at his house .",they were exciting i guess one of the girls names was heather hooters she was pretty but i doubt she was 100 % natural is anyone i know going to read this ?,"that 's ok cause i am happy with who i am i will tell the whole world i love , well something , i wo n't mention because if the president of this university knows he will transfer me to a and m. ok i love farming .",the sound of the plow chu chu chu through the grass is almost enough to bring me to orgasm .,one more minute can you tell i 'm looking at my watch i should n't treat this as a paper where i am talking to someone else but rather just with myself but how can i think about anything else when my fingers hurt so much from typing maybe camille,will call but i hope i can hold off on calling her -

so i 'm sitting here .,i do n't know what to talk about .,except for the fact that the latest mars volta cd is amazing .,i especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music .,its

"this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio , texas .","i went there to get some more items from my house , and as you can tell i 'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm .",the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes ; plus the food here is excellent .,this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do .,"however , last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished .",i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order .,at first when i went to the co-op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i did n't need about three of them .,"so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed , and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me .","this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team , but i still managed to have a great time .",i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me .,the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old .,he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make .,"i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth , but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home .",i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years .,we went out to eat and to see a movie .,"we were n't sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am , and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a",girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street .,"he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her , but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her , but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love",with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted .,in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be .,i ca n't wait for winter time .,it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there .,"one of the worst times i 've ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us , and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump , landed wrong , and i smashed my head into some ice",leaving myself with a nice concussion .,"all together i would have to say that i 'm very excited about this year , and i ca n't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-1.451109 -0.003022 0.996947 0.529718 -0.140648 0.257048 -0.32298 -0.202227 -0.500505 -0.158768 0.06642 -0.590446 -0.106132 0.899066 -0.897843 0.0 -0.04277 -0.672278 -0.591297 0.483783 -0.493585 -0.493794 1.087948 -1.295614 -0.624052 1.555974 1.460988 0.41837 -1.183367 -0.026615 0.03076 -0.326273 -1.677864 -0.906028 -1.017959 -0.706556 -1.947764 -1.168963 -1.554189 -1.321538 0.790387 -1.722056 0.296675 -0.154679 0.29321 0.163141 -0.766118 1.11544 -0.204203 0.710333 1.08229 1.971616 1.297034 -1.046194 -1.24553 -0.900043 -2.123839 -0.272693 2.282181 -1.037224 2.262036 0.987001 -0.480161 0.132523 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.164122 -0.359021 -0.073676 0.657467 -0.607823 -0.37208 1.272742 -0.422267 -1.006714 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.267475 4.869986 3.756344 4.838474 4.91729 4.401627,2265

entering college is a whole new experience that is new to me .,one that is unique in its own right .,an experience that begins a new transition from the home to a life of individuality and freedom .,"being only three hours away from home , it did n't seem like i was breaking away on my own , but in actuality this is only the start of creating a new life for myself .","after high school , everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves .",one friend would move to new york and another would move to california .,the once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast .,"although ut is a new change for me , it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on .","from this day forward , i am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past i can put behind as memories .",the challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature .,"back in high school , i would hear stories of friends failing out of ut due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol .",everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own .,i would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home .,"these stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that i would not be like the rest , but an individual .","that 's what ut is basically is , just a group of individuals all with the same goal , a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives .",its like its own community at ut .,all students relatively the same age trying to create a future for themselves .,i sometimes wonder if i have what it takes to succeed at ut .,my mind is still in doubt seeing the enormous campus each day as i walk to class .,but all i can ask for is for my best and that is good enough for me .,"even though ut is a different city than my home town dallas , i still feel like i have n't left dallas in a way .",with all my friends attending this university it just seems like dallas all over again which is one of the reasons i was considering going out of state .,"it seems great to have a large number of your friends close to you , but in a way i have a desire to start totally fresh .","throughout campus , i would see students from my school walking up and down the street and sometimes wish that a whole new atmosphere was around me so that i can begin a life that is not attached to my old one .",the university of texas does however let you become any kind of person you desire with a new start even though it is kind of mixed in with the old .,"as for home , i sometimes wonder if my parents are doing well without me .","with their constant calls and visits , it seems like they lost a part of themselves when they had to let go of me .","so along with the stress that comes along with being a student at a ut , my stress also comes with the worry of how things are back home .","seeing my mom cry , tore my heart apart with the goodbye that completed my transition to ut .",i notice how people do n't show how lucky they are that they have an opportunity like going to ut but instead take it lightly as if its nothing when in fact thousands of dollars are being invested in you in hopes that you create a successful future for yourself,college is a whole new experience that allows you tremendous independence .,it is my job that i spend my time wisely and take advantage of the situation in creating something out of myself .,i see some of my friends just wasting their lives away on drugs and partying .,"i would like to do something for them , but their destiny is

i am feeling very tired at the beginning of this strange assignment .,"what a long weekend , and day it has been .",rainy days always seem so long and dreary .,it has just recently stopped raining but i wish that it had n't .,"in my opinion , days spent studying are much better when it is dark and gloomy out than sunny and shiny .",i actually love the rain and really enjoy rainy days .,i would really prefer for the rainy days to also be cold but that does not happen very much this time of year .,one thing that i have been thinking a lot about recently is this new season that is rapidly approaching .,"i love the fall more tham anytime of year , especially the month of october .",what a fabulous month it is .,"october is long sleeve and jacket weather , football games , state fair of texas , and the time when the leaves change .",it is always so pleasant and so comforting .,"i do not know why or when my obsession with october started but it did , and it has been a part of my life for quite some time .",this will be my first october away from home though so my expectations could very likely not be met .,that would be a dissapointment but it would also serve as a reminder to me to not expect anything .,i really wish that i would never expect anything from anybody because i am always setting myself up for a dissapointment when i do that .,people that do not have really high expectations from others or situations must really benefit from life because everything that happens to them is better than they though it would be .,"that is actually probably not always true but , its a thought .",i tend to have too high expectations from people .,"i have a big imagination so i will usually get worked up about something before it ever happens , and spend time imaging what it might be like .","when i do that , i always find myself dissapointed when things do not turn out the way that they are supposed to .",i am about to be distracted from my stream of conciouseness because my roomate and friends keep talking loudly in the hall and i can hear them .,it is late at night so i did not take my medicine to help me focus so i hope this does not become too much of a problem .,it is very hard for me to concentrate when i can hear one distinct conversation in the background .,"it is a strange thing , but i could write a paper in the middle of a crowd if it is just useless , background noise , nothing clear , just a lot of muddled voices .","if i hear a conversation though , a really clear conversation among a group of people , it becomes near impossible for me to focus .",why is that ?,i really do not know .,i hate that i am so easily distracted .,it is a joke sometimes to even attempt to have a conversation with me about one topic unless i have taken my medicine .,"i have had add for a long time so i do not mind telling people that it does not come natural for me to stay in one , focused conversation for extended periods of time .","it is really very sad at times actually because i feel like i am hurting feelings when i do not give a person my full attention , but i do n't mean to be .",i just have trouble staying on one topic because almost every topic easily flows into a new topic .,what a mess i get myself into .,i really do amaze myself at times .,"people probably think that i am very rude but i am not , i just ca n't stay focused .",right now i am getting a sore in my mouth and it is really bothering me .,i think that it has formed because of the amount of sugar that i have consumed in the last two days .,someone gave me an enormous sack full of candy as a gift and i have consumed about 1 ' 2 of it in the last 48 hours .,that is not something that i normally do .,"i do not feel good about eating candy , or anything unhealthy most of the time .",i am actually proud of myself for indulging though .,everybody needs to treat themselves every once in a while .,i have a sweet tooth also so i have to satiate it from time to time .,i just hope that i never turn into a glutton .,how does one become a glutton ?, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

that i like to laugh as i read .",i enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud .,"if it makes you stand up and dance , well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading .",it is a shame that i do not write as much as i used to .,"the ideas are there , i just have not gotten them out yet .","they will be there , it will just take time .",i guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there .,"my memory is not the greatest right now , at 19 years old .","when i hit seventy or beyond , i ca n't wait until i have to write my name on my hand just to remember it

i 'm starting to feel tired and lazy .,that sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now i feel really comfortable as i sit in this chair and look at the screen .,i feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed .,i feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down .,i 'm thinking about going to gregory but i feel so relaxed that i probably wo n't go .,its such a long walk and then i have to come back to my room before i go to another class .,"i wish my dorm room was closer to gregory , then i think i would go more often .",instead i always tell myself i 'm going to go but most of the time i just put it off .,"my back is sore and i think i need to stretch it , my legs are also sore .",i know it has to be from all the walking in between classes .,i ca n't wait for tonight .,monday night football .,my night to sit on the couch and watch tv .,i wonder who is playing .,"i think its the eagles and bucaneers , but i 'm not sure .",i think the bucaneers have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year .,i know for sure the cowboys are going to be bad .,they will finish around 6 to 7 wins .,"if they win more , it will be a successful year for them .",i wonder where my roommate is .,"he always leaves the lights on in our room , so i know he has been home and left already .",i really wish i was done for the rest of the day and did n't have another class .,i would definitely take a nap .,naps are so key .,they are rejuvenating beyond anything else .,my hair is always in my eyes .,i think its time for me to finally get it cut .,"its annoying now , its too hot to have long hair in my face .",also it looks kind of shaggy .,i 'm taking my shoes off .,that feels better .,ooh .,that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad .,ill have to put another band aide on it .,i need to start playing basketball more so i wo n't get blisters when i just play on occasions .,"the only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play , so i never get the chance to practice my shot .",so in the games i end up missing most of the time .,fortunately the competition is not real high at gregory .,although i have seen brian boddicker and sidwell harris up there at times .,i ca n't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that .,what if they got hurt ?,he would be infuriated .,how would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game .,does not sound right .,"you know what else is not right , chance mock starting t quarterback .",texas 's offense is so predictable with chance at qb .,run cedrick benson up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it .,that is when chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it .,"on the other hand when vince young is at qb , you ca n't predict what is going to happen .",he is much more of a threat .,"he can run , scramble , elude tacklers and throw also , at least that is what he did against new mexico st. i know its the aggies of new mexico st. that we played last week but he did better than chance mock against the same guys .",so i think he deserves the start against arkansas this upcoming week .,i ca n't wait to rub it into mic 's face when we beat them .,i hope he finds a ticket and can come down from arkansas for the game .,he will definitely be intimidated by the texas crowd .,how long has it been since i have done my laundry ?,not since i left home i think .,i really do n't want to do laundry in my dorm room .,it takes too long .,i think i 'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever i go home .,"probably around homecoming , which is the same weekend as the texas ou game .",i ca n't believe i did n't get a ticket for that .,that really pisses me off .,"i did get lucky though with my season tickets , section 20 row 7 , right behind the cannon .",that was a pretty good draw for a freshman .,"still , ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the texas ou game .",best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else mack brown should be fired .,that would be the fourth year in a row .,he can recruit like its nobody 's business but he ca n't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game .,straight up he gets out coached every time by bob stoops .,what a stud .,my fingers are getting a little tired from typing ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

spend more time defining the box rather than thinking outside it .,"heck , we rarely even spend time thinking inside of it .",my dad 's friend is starting this school in which they let kids pretty much do whatever they want .,"they provide guidance but not rules , set boundaries but do n't fence the kids in .","their objective is to let the kid develop his or her own self-discipline , not letting some adult develop it for him or her so that when they get out into the real world , they do n't curl up into a little ball and hide or rebel and go",crazy and not know what they 're doing .,"while i think it 's a pretty cool idea , others reject the fact that a school like this exists because people are ingrained with rules , their lives governed by the boundaries of the box .","so

i hate it when you get so confused and you do n't know what to think about anything .,sometimes you think you are making the right decision but then you start to doubt yourself .,i guess i tend to do that a lot lately .,i never know if what i am doing is right or not .,will it work in the long run ?,oh well .,school gets to be confusing but i guess that is at least something that is relatively constant .,i do n't think i deal that well with change .,but i am not so sure anyone really does .,things tend to be uncertain a lot more that a lot of people like to admit .,the only thing that i know for sure is that no one person stays the same no matter how much they would like things to .,"personally , i have always thought that it is possible to care or even love more than one person at the same time .",i am not sure why or when monogamous relationships came around but i am not exactly sure they work .,"i actually have a lot of proof , just look at the divorce rate .",but i guess that is not really proof of anything except for the fact that people have given up forgiving other people for their mistakes .,"everything changes schools , and people and everything else .","when you see people that you have known a long time in a different setting , why does everything seem so weird .",some of them seem nicer others have changed so much that you ca n't even recognize who they are .,"anyway , i am really tired of thinking about this .",computers can really get so annoying .,i realize that they are supposed to be a good thing but they can be really confusing too .,i guess everything really is .,i am getting really tired of talking to myself or at least that is how i feel i wonder what draws certain people to certain things .,like what makes me like the color pink and someone else absolutely detest it ?,my next question is why do i put things off ?,i guess because i do n't like to admit to myself that i actually have work to do .,plus i guess i am just plain lazy .,there 's nothing like having a few really close friends but then that can be a bad thing too .,"but another problem is when you have a group of friends , and of course if there are guys and girls in the group as there normally one of them becomes attracted to another and of course that can become a huge problem .",the worst thing is that if something does happen between those people then it will eventually seriously affect the rest of the group .,la la la !,i feel so retarded right now and my time is up .,so i guess this is goodbye .,at least until i do my next righting assignment ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.678279 -2.04065 0.663373 -2.574774 -1.57479 -1.311723 1.327709 0.22003 0.691929 -0.666179 -0.153305 0.675395 -0.189689 0.102836 0.493292 0.0 -0.04277 -0.677695 -1.262251 -0.795527 -1.546001 2.414917 -0.384752 1.273215 -0.624052 0.174314 -0.852487 -0.508333 0.009903 -0.301077 0.33631 -0.495529 0.144621 1.359777 -0.247701 -1.109326 0.937975 0.439875 1.143878 -0.474797 -0.264303 2.872041 1.601251 -1.138828 -0.554269 -1.181547 0.153949 1.036538 -0.061085 0.75242 2.424271 -0.493244 -1.42027 2.162351 0.322009 -1.164597 -1.389418 -0.088562 -1.511346 2.534197 -1.643427 -0.367855 -0.480161 0.36965 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.268516 -0.775092 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.519543 0.393361 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.068681 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.937376 4.79603 4.716173 4.321492 4.458204 4.813406,332

.,"somehow , somewhere , i got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine .","in doing this , it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine .",basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first .,user-initiated contact goes through unmolested .,"so by masking it self as a program , the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers .",i only have 5 minutes left to write now .,that is good .,"man ,

is still inside me .","i feel it everyday : in class , before i go to bed , when i wake up .","i remember the feeling of being with him , and i miss it .",i miss him so much .,i hate having taken him for granted .,"i hate the fact that things could have worked out , had i simply admitted to myself that i had fallen for a guy .",that 's all i needed to do .,"all i could do was ignore him , laugh at him , all this while trully knowing there was something else .",i did all of this knowing that i meant none of it .,i was fighting it !,"i was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth , all guys are the same .",they 're all jerks .,be careful who you fall in love with .,"do n't fall in love in high school , it 's too soon .","you have your whole life ahead of you. `` i knew they were only trying to protect me , i knew they were saying this because they themselves having been guys , knew what it is guys were after .","but no , not hugo !",he was different .,"he was n't horny or all over me , or asking me weird sex stuff .",not once did he do this .,not once did he push me into something i did n't want to do .,not once !,"we dated for a year , and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other 's foreheads and cheeks .",this was it .,and god did he do stuff for me .,"i hated saying i needed something or felt a certain way in front of him , because he had always go out of his way to help-always !","for valentine 's day , he designed a shirt that said , `` monica , will you be my valentine ?","'' i remember that morning , walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something , knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me .","i hugged him , nodded , and smiled .",that was all he needed .,i do n't know what i would n't do to have those feelings all over again-with him !,"i dream about laying beside him , while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders .","and just watching him breathe , watching his chest rise and lower , as he breathes .",wow !,such an amazing sight .,"now , all i have are our memories , most of them of me being a 'bitch ' to him , treating him so unfairly .","maybe he does deserve better than me , maybe this is all part of god 's plan .","but you see , i know god knows me and he knows i have a big heart , but am just afraid to show it .",he knows this .,"he knows how sometimes , it 's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection , or something or other .",but what now ?,should i wait ?,i guess so .,"deep down , i have this feeling that it is not over between hugo and i by a long shot .",i know it 's not over by a lot .,"i remember how hugo treated his parents , better than i 've ever seen anyone treat their parents , with such respect and love .",i 've always had this thing that a guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother .,"his dad also , that

today is 911 and it has been a whole year since the tragedy last year .,i remember that day being in first period and hearing of a plane flying into the tower .,"obviously , that was all the people at school talked about that day , and the shock was great .",it surprised me so much that my teachers did n't take out time from classwork to talk about the event .,this is the biggest most memorable event of our lives and i thought it deserved more .,so much more than just the acknowledgement .,"yeah , the principal came on , but it did n't seem like enought .",i would have liked to discuss it with my class .,"actually , yesterday in my rhetoric class this guy in my class made this annoying comment that he thinks the president took advantage of what happened on 911 to ask the nation for volunteers .","i was outraged at what he said , how can you be so stupid ( to put it bluntly ) .",that is n't very nice for me to think but our nation is in a time of need and this past year was a very unique time .,the president totally has the right to ask for volunteers and was in no way taking advantage of 911. it bothers me when people speak about that things when they should take more time to think about what they 're really saying .,"yeah , so anyways .","911 , everytime i hear one of those songs about the event it gives me chills up and down my body , the chills are uncontrolable and it makes me feel good though that it happens .",i always get chills when i really really enjoy or care mostly about what i 'm seeing or hearing .,that is so interesting how the body works that way .,i do n't think about getting chills but they just start running up and down my body .,"although , i get chills i do n't usually cry .","i 'm not a very emotional person , but all depends on what 's going on around me .","lately i have been pretty stressed out from the this huge change in living , change in schedule .","and , i can cry easier probably because i 've been so stressed .","i find time to take it away , like when i run , i am not stressed .",i could think about all i have to do while i 'm running but the thing is i 'm not stressed while i 'm running because i know i need to run and i ca n't study while i run so it does n't stress me out .,does that make any sense in the way i wrote it .,"in other words , if i was watching tv , and i know i have to study , then i would be stressed because i know i could be studying instead of watching tv .",i am very good at managing my time so i know that i will be able to accustom myself and get used to my schedule better .,i 've just been so used to my routine at home that it is hard to change here .,"what does n't help me very much is that i have late classes , no earlier than 11a .",m. and the other three days are at 1pm .,"therefore , i usually sleep until classes where if i had 9 or 10 am classes i would be up earlier and more time to study during the day .",i like to get my homework and what i need to get done out of the way .,i do n't usually find myself as a procrastinator .,i 've definitely learned my conservative ways from my father and probably picked up most of those traits from him .,although i 'm not as simplistic as he is .,everything to him is simple .,simple .,period .,it bugs me sometimes how simple everything has to be but i 've picked up on some of those things because i see myself doing the same things he does .,and it bothers me when people are too loose .,"i like to clean , organized , in order and when people i know are late and too loose about what they do it irritates me .","yes well , i was just thinking about this song i was listening to today called make yourself it has great lyrics and you can probably tell from the title what its about : not to let other people influence your ways maybe in the sense of copying them but",do what you want to do and feel .,make yourself ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i know i said that i was ready to write but im not too sure exactly what i need to be doing .,i hope this is right .,great now im worrying .,i worry way too much that is a problem of mine .,i always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it i even worry about other people 's problems .,i wish i could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend joseph .,he 's also my roommate .,now im now sure if this is right because im telling you about myself when im just supposed to be thinking .,okay now im thinking .,why is my room so hot .,sometimes its not hot but right now im boiling .,i think it is because i am nervous about this assignment .,theres no reason to be i just need to type .,well here i am typing .,my room smells funny right now .,joseph bought some cinna sticks from dominoes a while back and i think that they are going bvad .,i know they are going bad .,i need to take out the trash than .,i hate that i get lazy and do n't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob .,great now i propbably sound all anal about mess when im not at all like that .,well im not a messy person but you know .,gosh reading over this i sound like such a pessimist and so boring .,oh well .,time sure is going by pretty slow .,i want to make jell-o but i do n't think i have room in fridge for it .,gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now .,i wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o .,like how does it form the way it does ?,whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o .,one day im going to find out .,more than likely i wo n't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that im gooing to look into it .,it makes me feel productive .,im worried about my financial situation right now .,i still have almost 4000 to pay off and i got a loan for that and all but i do n't know where that money is or who i need to talk to in order to get my hands on it .,tomorrow i guess ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that .,i ca n't think of anything else right now .,i feel like im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am i to say no .,this should be an easy a or at least i hope .,i hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because i said easy a then im going to get like a b or something .,"just in case im sorry even if this seems easy i do my work and i dedicate time so when it comes down to it , i think i deserve that a .",great im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment .,i wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance ?,i doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up .,but then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them .,ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient .,is lenient even a word ?,"oh well anyhow the teacher , her name was ms. ng , she scored perfect on her sat 's .",how the heck did she ever pull that off .,and since she did i have no idea why shes teaching at edison .,in case you dopnt know which you probably do n't edison is a public inner-city school in san antonio and it does not have the best of reputations .,i hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to ?,and that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond edison .,esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from edison .,well thats their loss because im a great person to know and i do n't fit the edison stereotype .,there should be no stereotypes .,they are just not fair .,hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up .,just 35 more seconds .,30 now .,wow this is actually good stress relief i should do this more often when i have time ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i was so excited about coming to ut and i still am but alot of things just over whelm me .,"for example , people in austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools .",basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that .,i am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example psychology i am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and i am always worried that im not taking the right notes .,what it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades .,i always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i wo n't let my self be that bad of a student .,i worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say f*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up .,i think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student .,i nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4 .,0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything .,that really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for,plates and food that gets left out and it is always him .,i know that sounds stupid but i do n't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it .,one thing that i do n't like about living in austin is that it is so expensive to live here .,"every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill , gas bill or telephone bill .","i really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me , i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool .",one more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out .,but i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together .,i wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her .,that is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not,around i really worried about that this summer .,and now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes .,"for example , in dallas she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to tcu i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people .",my goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl .,i ca n't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.419095 -0.298801 1.253255 -0.660005 -0.127921 -1.390631 0.287825 0.438969 0.265034 0.125231 0.097949 -0.590446 -0.657249 0.631296 -0.412377 0.0 -0.04277 -0.04992 -0.338415 0.119044 -0.324996 -0.520238 1.196631 1.567151 -0.10901 -0.736168 0.721533 0.037166 0.146508 -0.727476 -0.42645 0.214285 1.025196 1.883644 0.878732 -1.109326 -0.358466 0.696218 -0.655465 0.00325 0.050958 -1.35315 2.390264 0.246277 -0.813745 1.251946 -0.215859 1.047125 0.653951 0.899098 1.547471 0.110523 -0.544193 -0.385681 -0.68411 0.072452 0.201307 0.263853 1.714326 1.939159 -0.479677 1.578739 -0.480161 0.039148 0.233306 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.24458 -1.088091 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.131575 -0.422267 -1.333689 -0.451544 0.365122 -1.904806 5.033949 4.670849 4.351827 4.708 4.436442,1651

this writing i mean .,there must be some point for this .,hopefully at least .,so far my classes have been pretty good .,i do n't have a huge workload yet .,i assume that it will pick up eventually .,especially next semester .,"from laurel 's experience , i have a feeling that next semester will be quite a bit tougher than this one .","actually , i am quite certain that it will be rough .","i will be taking differential equations -- which scheffer said was hard -- and physics , which i know will be hard .","oh well , i can handle it .","i am enjoying school , though .",it is quite a bit different than anything else i have experienced this far in my life .,all the freedom and extra time .,i just like the atmosphere that is college .,it 's fun and different .,well only five minutes have gone by so far .,i 'm still a little hungry .,i should have had more lunch .,oh well .,"i only have one more class , and it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour .",that 's not too bad .,i am writing on a macintosh computer right now .,"i did n't particularly want to use one , but it was available , so i took it .",they are n't too bad i suppose .,it would take a little getting used to .,and the keys are quite a bit more sticky than i am used to .,and the fact that the mouse has only one button it a little odd .,but the thing that i find most interesting is the fact that microsoft internet explorer is on an imac .,i had always wondered if microsoft put out programs on apple 's .,quite interesting indeed .,now i 'm pushing the 9 minute mark .,"looking back , this is quite a bit of stuff i have written in the last nine minutes .",all pretty meaningless though .,i think i may just stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing .,you know the feeling -

i do n't understand how it is i 'm supposed to write this thing when i ca n't even type as fast as i can think .,it 's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think .,at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller .,i have trouble with double letters in words .,for instance tomorrow .,is that right ?,it 's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart .,i hate when people call me smart because i do n't feel it .,it 's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really do n't .,i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening .,my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard .,well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap .,i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them .,they were so bluh .,i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad .,but never anything serious that involved me .,and my step mom lied to me about most of her life .,telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she ca n't have kids .,then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me .,people never i 'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me .,that 's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you have n't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes .,i think it 's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay .,last month i had to pay $ 117 on that stupid cell phone .,i did n't even realize i had talked that much on the thing .,now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write .,can i cuss on this thing .,i do n't want to sound dumb or uneducated ( which actually to some degree i 'm not and early i did say i was n't smart ) does that make me crazy .,i wonder if i can type stuff in another language .,say for instance people who 's first language is n't english like my boyfriend .,i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i ca n't speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it .,and i normally understand it too .,but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor .,"i want to be a teacher too but i 'm afraid because i 'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework , but my pre-cal i dread .",maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems .,they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off .,i think i 'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem .,but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer .,"i am developing absolutely horrid study , sleeping , and everything else habits here .",i do n't even clean as often as i used to .,i just want to be lazy and go out .,i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict .,i never even got in trouble at school .,not that that is to be rewarded because you 're supposed to behave in school and make good grades .,which i did .,but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too .,but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes .,i 'm not just exaggerating either .,my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did .,and he has explained why he kicked me out .,it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything .,sometimes life sucks big time but i 'm not about to complain anymore because i 'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes .,i want to keep writing but i 'm supposed to do my pre-cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i do n't have ., , , , , , , , , , ,

well this weekend has been really different .,i guess that 's because it was the first '' actual weekend that my friends and i actually went out and `` explored '' austin .,"i know that we have been here for two weeks already and have n't `` explored '' austin , but i think it was better this way .",the first weekend we did n't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago .,it was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us .,"she had in a way `` made new '' friends , which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in austin .",what was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party .,"i do n't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school , it 's just that she was leaving austin ( the party was in san antonio ) and the driver said she was n't going to drink a lot .",i was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking .,i feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person should n't drive .,i guess that 's what this whole college experience is all about .,people are responsible for making their own decisions here .,no one is here to tell them what to do and no one should .,these people are adults now and can think for themselves .,"i also know that another reason i did n't want to or even want to go home until i really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family , especially my mom .","i know that i 'm close to my father and my younger sister , but it seems that every time i talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last thursday , i felt like i needed to cry .",i do n't know why i felt like that .,i know that we 're very close but i really do n't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be .,i also have another worry on my mind .,"one of my guy friends had be accepted to the university of houston and he was rooming with my best friend 's boyfriend and according to them , everything was great .",my guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle .,"and this past summer they had spent , from they told my friends and i , nearly every day together .","or if they were n't together , they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours .",to me that sounds kind of like they could n't leave each other alone or trust each other but i do n't know if that would be normal because i have n't really been in a relationship like that .,"well to continue with my worry , according to my best friend 's boyfriend , our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend ( she is going to the university of north texas in denton ) .","every time his girlfriend would call him , he would get sad .","and my best friendn 's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus , and he would be happy , however as soon as she called , he would get sad again .",and of course we all understood that him missing her was normal .,well the university of houston started two days before we did and that monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her .,well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to denton .,and he told my best friend 's that he was never coming back .,what we do n't understand is why he decided that .,this is his first relationship and they already have given each other `` a promise ring '' or a `` promise gift '' because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring .,what my friends and i do n't understand is what is going on through his head .,well my time is almost up .,i have like ten seconds left so i guess that 's it ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

's kind of cool , but it is going to be a completely new experience .","i guess i could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if i could get a job with them , but that just would n't be good .","i want to be able to say , `` here is what i did , and i did it all by myself. `` i know that it 's natural to want to get out from under your parent 's wing , but it

to offer at least once .,that way they can say that they 've done it .,"in addition , they 'll know what it is .","you know , i always feel awkward when i am in a conversation that turns stale .",( i.

people .",i know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is .,that 's pretty sad .,i think that they need to start living today for what it is worth .,that 's what i try to do .,i guess my 20 minutes are up .,"this was kind of an interesting experiment , but i am not entirely sure what the results are .","i do n't really know myself , and i

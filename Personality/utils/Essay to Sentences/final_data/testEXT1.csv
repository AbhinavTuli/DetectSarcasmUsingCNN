want to hurt him , but i am scared about settling down after college for so many years i saw college as being the perfect time to party","and meet boys , but now it is n't like that i love to flirt but i have someone that cares about me and that i care about but i just do n't know to i want to settle down with someone that does n't even have a high school",diploma .,i 'm scared he 's going to end up using me or something stupid like that .,i know that is mean but so far he does n't keep his promises to me and he lies and i pay for everything but it does n't matter he will pay me $ 200 i think i have spent over $ 1000 on our relationship .,going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks .,oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 20 minutes of my life i

stream of consciousness that term reminds me so much of virginia woolf and my long semester studying her and mrs. dalloway .,i ca n't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how mrs. dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad .,i feel so bad for her .,i wonder how fast twenty minutes really is i bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but i guess it is kind of interesting i just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing .,i am so glad that it is labor day weekend and i am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and i guess some studying too although that wo n't be too fun so that will actually take away from,some of the fun goal .,it is so interesting how i am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and i some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely,and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that i can concentrate on just about anything .,i hope this year goes well because i think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year i if the semester goes well .,"i 'm getting kind of sad now that because i am leaving town tomorrow i am going to miss the first football which will be my first texas football game and i have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun , but at least there are",plenty of other games that i can attend .,my hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering i have n't even typed for 10 minutes .,i wonder if i am missing out on anything while i am sitting her typing this but i guess it is n't that big of a deal i do n't think there are many people her anyway and i do n't know where anyone is .,i was thinking about how when i graduated from high school that i would be balling my eyes out but i did n't cry then i thought i would cry when my parents left me here all alone .,but the weird thing is i have n't cried or anything yet i have n't even gotten homesick .,i mean let 's face it is n't like i would have anything spectacular to do even if i was home so i guess that helps in the homesickness department .,"it is so cold in my room i am absolutely freezing and there is no way in which to control the air , i need gloves and winter boots .","i really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings i mean i know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat , but",then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like i am surprised i have n't gotten frost bite from these frigid places .,well the time has actually gone faster than i expected it to it has n't been all that bad once i got over the whole virginia woolf suicide and her book that i had to suffer through and analyze .,it has actually been kind of fun i mean all i have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how i am feeling and that is n't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you,write because personally i do n't ' want everyone in the world to know how i feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part .,i am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best .,that is real comfort food .,wow i am beginning to feel hungry now but i do n't know for what also i really need these twenty minutes to over so that i can run and go get a drink i am really thirsty .,oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer .,but hey i do n't have to type for too much longer ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today was a very long and exhausting day .,"i began by waking up at 8:15 , after only 6 hours of sleep , to go to a 9:00 art history discussion lab at the museum .","it actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep , that way i would n't be as tired as i am right now .","but instead i decided to go ahead and go to class , otherwise i would just fall behind and not know what happend .","personaly , i am not one to really like getting behind , so i think that i made the right decision , granted i may be tired right now , i know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run .","as my day continued , i went to the actual class lecture for art history .","it was somewhat interesting , although i found it a little difficult to consentrate .",i guess that may be because i did not catch up on my reading that i was supposed to have completed by today .,obviously i am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities .,"futhur in the day , i went to the dentist to get a filling , which was not fun !",the right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours .,"that may not sound like too long , but in reality , when your mouth is numb and you ca n't talk well , and you ca n't eat or drink anything because you will spill it , it is a long time .",then i proceeded to go to a meeting .,i had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while i was gone .,this kind of bothered me just because i payed for this computer and i could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers .,i just do n't really think that that is fair .,"then what really irritated me , which does n't happen too ofter , is that when i came back from the meeting , the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor .","my brand new shirts that are not even two days old , my purse , and my shorts , were all on the ground .","now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it , but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it 's place is rude .","i was quite mad , so instead of confronting her , i just left and went to get tcby and to watch tv with my sister .",i guess you could say that i did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off .,"oh well , what 's done is done , but next time i think that i just might have to say something to her ( if i let her use my computer next time ) .","well , that was pretty much my day , and now i am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework , which is making me stressful .","i know that i will be relieved when i finish it all , though .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,1.234983 -0.860577 0.03457 -0.900529 -1.456307 -0.120923 -0.235847 -0.673312 -0.928778 -0.526073 -0.03412 -0.590446 0.080305 0.547394 -0.12617 0.0 -0.04277 -0.188444 -0.157321 -0.795527 -0.380214 1.020499 -0.459817 0.73514 0.057195 -0.479096 1.064231 0.371697 -1.331762 -1.573423 -1.100231 -0.560461 -0.20683 0.14823 -0.301172 -1.109326 -1.084227 -0.374272 -0.812125 -1.259692 1.123265 0.716693 -0.514146 -0.370593 -0.615029 0.473577 -1.093488 -0.718262 0.361825 -0.25412 -1.34699 1.183205 1.918965 -1.123471 1.525958 0.296409 0.951636 0.656937 -0.026474 0.45052 1.095259 -0.835643 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.875738 1.469672 0.295867 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.134645 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.885114 0.703426 -0.067562 -0.313992 4.856168 4.012324 4.464321 4.733126 4.555526,708

"i just had lunch , they actually had good cookies at the dobie cafeteria today .","i 'm really happy i found out that masha lives in dobie too , she kind of bothered me in high school , but i think i might like her now better than almost anyone i met .",she 's very sincere .,i 've been more happy than ever since i 've been at ut only because i 'm on my own .,"i feel no sense of homesickness at all , like most people are talking about , i 'm the way i like myself without my mother who drives me crazy .",i do n't understand sometimes how in the world we 're related .,someone just came in .,"i love that feeling when you feel like your stuffed animals have personalities , the two dogs on my bed could easily be taken for real ones , well kind of , if one of them was n't blue , maybe .",but not really .,"alex and arif came by last night , two of my good friends from high school , it made me really happy ; i was literally bouncing off the walls because i thought it was nice that they just came by unannounced ; i do n't know why it surprises","me because i know they care about me , but when people i care about do something nice ; it kind of surprises me .","i could never keep a diary , i absolutely love writing more than anything in the world .","i want to become a writer , but i always start with something and never finish or am honestly too lazy and that pisses me off a whole lot .","i love it and i want to do it , but i do n't know why i wo n't just do it .","but diaries drove me crazy ; i found myself being fake in them , i think it 's easier to show your true self through other words rather than blatently posting , i 'm writing this about myself to understand myself it does n't work like that for me .",you can see the real me through other writing i think .,i downloaded this song called forever by ben harper .,it is so good ; it has the sweetest melody .,it 's very wierd ; i sometimes write poems and just little phrases and i 've noticed i use the color blue a lot .,like the ocean is blue and once a poem about my parent 's divorce and i used something about a blue world or something ; i do n't know where it comes from .,my mother really drives me insane .,"her friends were in this past saturday and they came back amazed at my independence , how i looked , acted , just my persona and everything and they were n't like that before about me .",and i know that i do seem a little different ; like a relief has been lifted off of me ; it 's great .,i like the person that i am .,"i spent too much time babying my mother , making sure i did n't say something to offend her or be upset because she was being ridiculous .","and she told me how they though all of this and said it in such a way as to take credit for my development and for me being the way i am , sounding great and all .",and i just wanted to scream that it is the opposite ;

ok so i am writing about my thinking .,well tonight was interesting .,i had a great time at the phi lamb meeting .,laura was really sweet i hope that i will get to know her better .,i wonder who my big sister will be in phi lamb .,hmm interesting .,i love big sisters in organizations .,which is kind of crazy because i just talked to my big sister from the drill team i was a part of in high school .,random .,even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me .,i promise when i have kids they will never be more than like three years apart .,i ca n't believe that in ten years i will probably be married with kids and all that .,oh my gosh .,where has the time gone ?,i am actually excited about being a mom .,my mom was amazing .,she may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her .,no one can argue like her that 's for sure .,i miss her .,but i will see her this weekend .,i ca n't believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game .,it is crazy .,i ca n't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home .,which is totally crazy .,i never thought i would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast .,but i guess that is a good thing .,i will be here for four years so i should probably make it feel like home .,so now that my boyfriend calls i am thinking about him .,i ca n't believe i am doing this whole long distance relationship thing .,it is the hardest thing in the world .,i miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late october .,i wonder if we will make it .,i know we can but it is so crazy .,four years of being six hours apart .,i wonder what we would be like married .,it would be amazing to be his wife .,he is the most amazing guy i have ever known .,everything i could ask for he has .,but still i get scared sometimes .,i wish i could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him .,i guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away .,i also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which would n't be good for either of us .,i believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if i had him there with me all the time .,anyways wow it is already eleven .,i really like this song .,i had never really listened to jack johnson but it is very relaxing .,i wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now i like this one too .,it kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why i like it so much .,i wish we had a tv though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger .,which is great but i do n't know whatever .,tomorrow is thursday .,i do n't really like thursdays .,my classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok i guess .,i had a lot of homework for tomorrow .,college is a lot different than high school in workload .,like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy .,i guess its good that i am typically an overachiever .,well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me .,but whatever .,i hope tomorrow goes by fast .,i ca n't wait till friday .,i get to go out on a boat .,that is going to be so much fun and then saturday is the football game .,i ca n't wait for that .,i have never been to a ut game so it is definitely going to be an experience .,wow it has been twenty minutes .,i guess i am done .,ok bye ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.301642 -0.674011 0.492972 0.123655 0.297375 0.361136 -0.014828 -0.309694 -0.313587 0.269124 -0.210578 -0.379472 -0.694984 1.02453 0.246596 0.0 -0.04277 0.365194 -0.150776 1.373963 0.210917 -0.110061 0.158108 -0.223736 0.84205 -0.566558 -1.130706 0.09344 1.252771 2.084839 -0.141248 -0.182063 -0.430067 -0.527886 -0.503763 -0.426297 -0.01987 -0.830443 0.470469 0.56319 0.512204 -0.393731 1.272451 -0.05101 0.031204 0.385836 -0.538325 0.656145 0.332126 0.460982 -0.431515 0.418405 -0.344386 0.850122 2.928566 0.196597 -0.65302 -0.954251 0.03051 0.139249 -0.7523 -1.325926 -0.480161 0.371151 -0.176714 0.901632 -0.086094 0.77171 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.35696 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.865526 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.718174 4.902969 3.624068 4.852205 4.988093 4.536634,2224

about two weeks before i came to austin i was already feeling the affect of college changing my life .,many of my friends left before i did and i said goodbye to all of them .,i knew that it would be awhile before i saw any of them again .,it feels really strange now that all the people that i have grown up with all my life are all going to new places .,many of the people from my high school i may never see again .,even though my high school was very large the faces i saw were familiar to me .,now that i am at the university of texas many faces i have never come across before and that is a strange feeling .,i kind of like having so many different people around .,it just makes me feel better to know that i 'm involved in such a large university .,everyone that i do meet is very nice and i am making many new friends .,my roommate and i are getting along very well and i am glad that i have him as a roommate .,"i have seen many people from my high school , but many of the upperclassmen i knew from my school live off campus so i might only run into them every once in awhile .",it is strange that i do n't have a `` bestfriend '' anymore because all of them are some other place .,the people i hang with are n't as close to me as my old friends were .,i guess that it has only been a couple of weeks so far and that is just how it will be until i live around here longer .,"i do n't really wish that i had gone somewhere else , but i just get that home sick feeling a little .","home sick does n't mean that i miss my parents so much , but just that all the people i was familiar with are gone .","i do n't really miss my parents that much yet , but i 'm sure that i will soon when i finally realize that i 'm not living there anymore and the ut is my home now .",i wish that i had a car so that i could go places around here .,i 'm stuck on campus pretty much all the time .,almost everything that i need is here though so that is a good thing .,"i wish that i could have brought my turntables up to ut , but my parents did n't want me to yet .",i hope that i can dj at some clubs when i get a little more experience .,my older friend was kind of my mentor to becoming a dj and i 'm hoping that he can give me the hook ups that i need to play at places .,i do n't like being alone in my room especially with the door shut it makes me feel closed off .,if i 'm here alone i will usually keep the door open so i can converse with the people outside .,they have really good study rooms in the basement of my dorm and its really good to go down there and read or do homework .,college so far has been pretty much what i expected it to be there has n't been any real shockers yet .,i only choose to come to ut my senior year .,my parents both went to arkansas so i did n't really have a bias to any college .,i visited a & m and ut as well as ou and some other colleges last year and that is when i made my decision to come here .,i like the urban atmosphere that ut has as opposed to all the other colleges i visited .,since the time is up i better go down to the basement to study or else i wo n't make it into the computer science major ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.023203 -0.263963 0.40231 -0.268682 -0.06415 2.323268 -0.794656 -0.77253 -0.19014 -0.071675 -0.071978 -0.590446 -0.884325 0.120817 -0.846986 0.0 -0.04277 0.137858 1.233035 -0.795527 1.086719 -0.742368 -0.74741 -1.052026 -0.624052 0.368814 0.054647 -0.750778 -0.585261 -0.270711 -0.736513 -0.36518 -0.70405 -0.906028 -1.017959 0.44501 -1.26815 -0.934344 -0.816179 -0.186659 -1.038726 -0.191984 1.479267 -0.41497 0.232532 -1.268367 0.801546 -0.768157 -0.928101 -1.143824 0.4759 -0.168527 0.751241 -0.581455 0.055205 2.602589 -0.171381 1.675958 -0.6509 1.615162 0.53749 -0.976131 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.617039 -0.991447 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.299135 -0.201433 -0.451544 -0.130265 -1.097539 4.921314 4.10515 5.076898 5.00192 4.200548,1212
right now i am thinking about this writing assignment .,i am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort i will have to put into it .,it appears to be low effort on both fronts .,i have two conflicting thoughts now .,on one side the easies gives me more time to relax .,it is night now and i am not really in the relaxing mood .,i want to go out and do something but somehow i am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than i was living with my parents .,my expectations of independence have not been meet yet .,i am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that .,i tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out .,"speaking of throwing things out , the trash is damn full .",this assignment is already starting to bore me and i just started it .,i wish i did n't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that i could dedicate my time to .,i find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging .,"when things are n't challenging , i must event a challenging task or at least a large one .",physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed .,now i workout for relaxation and for selfimage .,naturally i am shy .,this bothers me because being shy involves things that do n't make sense to me .,i really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if i do n't remind myself of these things talking to someone is n't a natural reaction .,i am pronature in many respects .,i am against the taking of medicine to the point wo n't take aspirin .,i am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods .,i am surprised i have n't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing i am more surprised at is that i have had none .,and now that i think about it i have n't had any for a long time .,i used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it did n't matter any more .,i got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed .,i was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed i have n't .,i do n't let anything affect me anymore .,"i have been away from my mom , dad , brother , sister , and dog and i do n't really miss them .",talking about the past too long also bores me .,i like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement .,it gives me excitement because i look forward to bigger and better things .,right now i ca n't define things .,"things used to be money , wife , good friends , and children .",i dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear .,bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind .,i have had a spiritual awakening .,"i not religious , in the sense i do n't go to church .",but i try to communicate with god in more subtle ways .,"i have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen , something good will happen .",i never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe .,the first night i was here i left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when i came back it had been found and returned to me .,i left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me .,"when i came back for it , it was gone .",i emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and i was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars .,luck is one of those things i do n't have .,i would never rely on chance more than i had too .,it was not luck my book was returned .,i am glad i am at ut or for that case away from home .,my mom is very pessimistic and impatient .,these thing irritate me to the point where i like avoiding her .,a categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in god but they do n't truly .,they are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me .,i have a friend who is always lying .,i think he does it to make people envy him .,but i do n't think he realizes i do n't envy people i just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them .,my mind is at a blank now .,i am only thinking about the humming of the computer .,time is up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

so today i went to class and i am really really tired i do n't know why because in high school i was never this tired and i never slept that much during the day now i sleep a lot more i have breaks in between my classes and i,"do n't like it because i do n't do anything useful during those breaks i either eat , sleep , watch my suitemates tv or sit and stare at the wall , i think that i have a obessive compulsive shopping disorder because i always want to shop i like",to shop and i always spend too much money i have the money from my parents but i should learn to save it but they did give it to me for clothes but i still shouldnt shop that much well oh well i like it so i do it i,really like my dorm i want to decorate the living room more but my roommate and my room is cute and everyone says that it is homely i hung up all my picutes the other day and i like it alot i really like my stuff i think it is,extremely cute it looks like a model dorm room it should because it took me forever to pick out what to buy and i got frames for all my pictures to match and my mom is making me a lamp to match it is going to be awesome well now,my boyfriend is going to come over and we are going to watch a movie that should be fun oh i forgot that are suitemates are having movie night oh well we can just watch it with them i never get pimples but i have a really huge one right,now and it is aggrevating me to death i guess that i am really concerned with my physical appearance but i ca n't help it anyways i do n't know what else to write umh the elevators at dobie are extremely annoying because they take forever and i always have,to take the stairs from the 12 floor i hate it but i never take them up maybe i should to work off calories oh that reminds me i really need to start working out again i have slacked off since summer school ended and fall started i should start,running again too i could go with my friend i will give her a call later well something is wrong with my labtop because any time i type too fast it stops and sends me to the upper portion of the page i hate it then i have to use,the mouse to get back down to start typing again i think that i am a true perfectionist it even shows in this writing assignment because anytime i spell a word wrong i have to go back and retype it the right way i wonder why i do that oh,i miss my car because i put it in the shop yesterday and i ca n't get it until tomorrow it is no big deal i do n't drive it that much down here anyway but i just like to know that i can drive when i want to it,is going to cost like 270 dollars to get the oil changed and the brake pads changed and the rotars grinded down they also had to give me a new ignition for something because of a recall i have a 98 honda accord ( it is so nice i love,my car fully loaded and everything all the extras ) and they recalled the ignition because it can just stall out when you are driving that is scary my stepmom called me and was worried because if i was driving on the freeway and it stalled it would not be,"good i said hey if someone hit me and maybe i would just get hurt enough so that i could sue honda and get enough money to pay for college and be able to drive my bmw and go on shopping sprees with my sisters , and mothers and all",the time that would be nice so i havent talked to my sister in awhile she is very sick not sick in a flu way but in a internal way like the brain and heart i love her so much and i am going to call her as soon as,i am done with this so that i can tell her how much i love her and when i go home we can hang out and i will take her and some of her friends to a movie and to eat i think that i need to get a job, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

year was the first time that i ever skiied and it was great .,i did a lot of things with church that i had never done before but i think that all of these things were because i got together with casey

i am thinking about calculus .,i wish i could be working on calculus instead of doing this assignment .,i wonder if i am doing this assignment correctly .,"do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking , or in question'sentence format .",well i made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how i have been taught to write at school for so long .,i am hungry .,"i should have made prepared something in the oven , so when i am done with this assignment i would be able to eat it .","now i have started so i must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty , or approximately 17 more minutes .",i am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is .,i guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking .,"i want to type things in here as if i was talking to someone , but then again i quickly remember that i am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness .",how fast should i be typing .,"should i think about it , then type it , or think about it as i am typing it , or is it a combination of both .","today , i have thought so much about thinking .",a new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible .,i can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus i am better able to control what i am thinking .,"this is good because the more control of yourself you have , the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also .",i think that sentence did not make much sense but i know that i know what i am talking about .,i am still really hungry .,i wonder how many minutes i have to go .,"oh , its at the top of the screen , so far i have completed 8 minutes .",what else is there to talk about ?,i don ' e exactly know what im thinking about right now .,wait .,ok. .,i think i am thinking too hard .,well what would you like me to write about .,what i think about really depends on what i am trying to think about .,and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank .,"but then again , it is not blank at all .",i feel like today was a great day .,everyday that i am alive is a great day .,"i also think that i worry too much , but when i worry less i have time to think about the things that really matter .",but what really matters ?,i am soooooooooo hungry .,i only have 9 more minutes to go .,"this writing assignment has to be one of the easiest , requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments .",but this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that i am actually starting to see how this ( thinking ' stream of consciousness ) works .,"once i master it , i feel like i will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world .",to find one 's self .,ok. .,now my stomach is growling .,i will be so happy when today is over and i get to lay my head to rest .,i am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that i think about it .,it really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break .,today i feel like my mind has been in overdrive .,"i have had at least three people tell me i am deep , and i met alot more people today .",user 's guide .,this book sitting right in front of me .,"i guess i took a break in thinking , and that is what i saw .",i am so tired .,"physically , mentally .","i have not pushed myself as much as i did today , and somehow i know it will be for the better .",i am so glad that my parent 's pushed me to go to college .,i think it is an absolutely great'priceless experience that everyone owe 's to themselves .,"knowledge is power , knowledge about one 's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life .",i love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior .,well i just looked at the time again and i have approximately 30 more seconds ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind .,this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote to the lighthouse and mrs. dalloway .,her name will come to me in just a second .,she was a very depressed person i still ca n't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die .,"oh well , i ca n't remember her name write now .",it is strange that i ca n't remember her name considering i read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work .,i think i ca n't remember because i feel too much stress the remember it .,"in fact , i feel like right when i stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head .",i can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head .,ok i am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what i read earlier today from c. s. lewis ' mere christianity .,it is amazing how much i am learning about the christian faith and i have been a christian for a while now .,i like what lewis says about society and morality .,how what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men .,no matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion .,well i think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id .,i will vehemently oppose such a measure .,it is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than i can write .,so while i 'm in the middle of writing this sentence i have already thought of 2 other things .,i am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics .,"to get to such high positions of power , one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but i wonder if that is really true i wonder if there can be honest politicians i wonder if there can be honest lawyers .",i surely hope so you know i remember reading one that diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day .,i wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has i still ca n't believe she is dead you know i feel like i am kind of censoring what i write because of the possibility that so ta might,what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it .,i think i probably would if i were a ta it must be really difficult to be a ta and be a grad student .,it is hard enough just being an undergrad student .,my head kind of hurts right now i wonder if that is from stress i think it is .,my apartment is quiet right now i am very glad i did n't go out with my roommates i like being by myself every once and a while .,i love not having to worry about any body but myself but i also love being around people .,i really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together i guess everything has its ups and downs even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on tuesday and thursday,instead of on mwf i 'm really now to nervous right now but i am sure i will get stressed out this semester i really need to learn how to deal with my stress .,if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit .,ok i only have to write for a couple more minutes .,it is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about it seems like i think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever i have quite time to myself i wonder why that is i am excited about this psychology class .,learning about human behavior is always interesting to me i think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- i guess sort of a power issue i hope that now why i am interested in psychology ., , , , , , , , , , , ,

"i am feeling rather comfortable right now , much more comfortable than in the previous days .","i do n't know if i made the right decisin in coming here , i guess that 's because people keep on asking me where i an from and when i say hawaii they all ask me why i transfered and why i came here , as if hawaii is",so amazing and this place sucks .,i guess hawaii is pretty amazing in some ways .,but it 's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there .,"added to that i do n't like knowing everyone , well i like knowing people but i do n't like it when you have no aninimity .","i also am thinking a lot about girls , girls and sex , sex and girls , i guess that goes without saying .","i feel like i have to step up my game and almost go out `` hunting '' for them , but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude .","it 's not terrible romantic , but i 'm getting pretty desperate .",there are some hot hot girls here .,"i do n't know what 's my problem , it 's probably because i live in simkins which is on the other end of the earth .","that 's probably also just an excuse , because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women .",although it is a lot easier when your living with them .,"it 's not so bad i 've meet some women here , but the one that i am more serious with , i do n't find myself attracted to at all .","she 's got a great personality , and she 's female , which is a definite plus , but i really ca n't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious .","it 's probably a partial ego problem , because of her relative homeliness .","but i really do like to be surrounded by beauty , yeah right why did you move away from hawaii .",no i really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics .,"i need to be with a really attractive woman , fat chance of that happening with this face , and this nose , and no hair cut , and this voice and this low self-esteem .","but i really want to go out with nicole , she is a goddess on earth , she is so sweet and gentle and gorgeous .","i ca n't belive it , and i act like such a dork around her but she does n't seem to mind , and that 's what i loooooovvvvveeeee about her she is so hot , i must do eveything in my power to win her i must put the","wheels in motion before she gets snatched up , because i know that if i do n't act soon and i mean like in the next five minutes , some other guy with more guts and better looks is going to see what i see and i cannnot let that","happen not this time , i 've let that happen too many times in the past i 've let every girl that i 've ever had feelings for get away .","and nicole may be the one , she 's in the fricking pharmacy school she could take care of me the looser that i am , but if i were with her i would not let that happen .","i would do everything for her , i would work night and day and fight my way to the top to provide for her .","i have my mission , i must develop my plan , and somewhere in between i must get some studying done .",straight a 's and nicole that will be the story of my life for this year ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.166661 -0.224681 0.337805 -0.362929 0.126192 -0.629468 -0.465691 -0.643045 -0.498343 -0.200421 0.021927 -0.590446 -0.111458 -0.462784 -0.228364 0.0 -0.04277 -0.078483 -0.193983 -0.795527 -0.418896 0.522586 0.700095 0.931734 -0.037454 -0.267563 -0.201505 -0.605929 0.401862 0.814999 -0.332839 -0.306643 -0.2852 -0.452135 -0.092157 -0.699398 0.087717 0.235337 -0.560069 0.771123 -1.038726 -0.048419 -1.263716 -0.112412 0.323824 -0.385248 -0.093926 0.379555 0.059038 0.491126 1.94961 -1.37796 -0.998396 -0.734422 -0.311388 0.512191 -0.358381 -0.260581 2.632788 1.2327 -0.514389 -0.283579 -0.480161 0.148121 -0.10257 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.029182 1.3908 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.103023 0.338759 0.948137 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.113893 4.944542 3.793616 4.255845 4.554744 4.763004,660
i just walked in my room from going out and it seems the ac is not working .,the room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days .,the smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as i look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor .,two canvases lay on the stained carpet .,"the idea was to paint each one different , but to have the same motif .",it was harder to come up with an idea than i thought it would be .,"that was a few hours ago , which was before i had a glass of the fratty punch .","it 's so silly , how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol .",what are they trying to do to us ?,women are not primitive .,we understand what they have in mind .,"see , if it was up to the guys , they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn .","but it is the punch that us ladies enjoy , and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply .","as i stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys ' house , i suddenly asked myself a question .",do these boys really want to talk to me ?,i wondered .,and if they do .,why ?,two things quickly were brought to my attention .,"one was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company , or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on , one which by the way took me 35 minutes to pick out .",how ironic huh ?,"the other was the fact that if they did n't desire to converse with me , that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk , and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties .","it was then that i realized that either way , they were talking to me , and i got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne , as well as to look into their dreamy eyes !",those stupid frat boys .,"man are they dumb , but they sure are entertaining !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.927322 -1.002325 -1.389728 -1.645065 -2.477927 -1.867117 0.961386 0.742613 0.140766 -1.120577 -0.146239 1.704946 1.587299 0.141964 0.141398 0.0 -0.04277 -0.991253 -1.841119 0.490588 -1.810412 -0.742368 1.565134 -0.471265 -0.624052 1.856521 2.827101 0.72827 -1.249861 -0.587968 0.79478 -1.430891 -0.877092 -0.906028 -0.001874 -1.109326 -0.069237 -0.15793 -0.369507 -0.042208 -1.038726 -1.443935 -0.306279 2.371731 1.45698 1.791812 -0.544969 1.277206 1.657991 1.015689 2.271087 -0.947135 2.68206 -1.416432 -1.319338 0.863726 1.267 0.187721 -1.096933 1.176564 -0.375373 0.56728 -0.480161 -0.745201 0.184547 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.617182 0.579471 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.375061 1.310805 0.818908 -0.422267 -1.19508 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.174778 4.49925 3.247093 4.387271 4.047435 5.759513,1556
i have n't been in the mood to do any homework .,i find it very hard just to sit down and study .,"as a freshmen , i have found many new experiences in the past week .","finally getting my email hooked up , i received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week .",my good friend from home wrote me from south west .,she informed me of great news .,she is having a ball at her new school .,"she is on the drill team , and making many new friends .",which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday ( sunday ) .,"as i came home from church , i was excited to see that i had two messages all for me !",: ) the first one is from a friend who attends ut .,"the other was from my best friend , who sadly is going to another college in wacol .","we could only talk for about fifteen minutes , which was n't enough time .","however , it was long enough so i could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends .",which leads me to the point that i am feeling terribly lonely .,"i do n't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes , but i am envious .","see , i came to ut because i did n't want to go to a & m because my brother went there .",ut and a & m were the only two schools which i applied .,"truthfully , i am not too excited about coming here .","however , i do n't want to go to a & m .",it 's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home .,"anyway , so i moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud .",so i have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home !,i am always here all by myself .,i have a total of four friends up here .,"one of which , heather , i spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views .",she knows how to get under my skin .,"however , we are closer than any of my other friends up here .",which leads to the final three .,"lindsey goes to st. edwards , and is so homesick .","she misses her boyfriend and her mother , which is understandable .","katie is a nice and wonderful , but we have n't spent too much time together , and sandra .",sandra i 've known since the seventh grade and did n't talk to her much my junior and senior years .,"you see her and lindsey are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking , so me being the insincere person which i am takes lindsey 's side .",my reasoning was because i thought sandra was inconsiderate of others needs .,"you see , i had every single class with her our sophomore year , and we kind of got tired of each other .",so back to the present .,"i do n't really know anybody , and i am bad at meeting people because i do n't know what to say .","do n't think i 'm quite or shy because that 's far from it , but i just do n't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation .",which leaves me very lonely .,it 's mainly my fault because i do n't want to spend much time with heather because we just know the right way to almost kill each other .,"katie , who is great and there really is n't a good excuse except i do n't really feel connected ( is that stupid ?",") lindsey , who is so homesick that she does n't want to do anything .","and sandra , who called me yesterday just to talk .",now how nice is that ?,"i mean , i went to sandra 's today before class , and i had fun .","she 's nice , not to mention beautiful , skinny , and very smart ( very .",) which i guess why i used to have bad feelings towards her .,she 's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends ( which she made ) but i kind of want to meet my own friends .,i group of new friends .,"also , lindsey the homesick one made friends too .","which is good , because she needs to be happy .","however , i think it is about time for me to make some friends .","well , also i tried out for the ballet class here .",it sucks !,i 'm so mad .,there are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate .,i was stuck in the freshmen class .,it is so bad .,i 've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight .,not to mention there is no pointe here !,"i am not trying to sound smug , because i was far from being the best at my studio at home .","but these girls are beginners , and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary .","do n't get me wrong , i was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque , but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination , to tell us were to `` place our arm on the barre '' i almost died",i know where to put it .,i do n't need help with that .,"i need help with my turnout , extension , balance !",not with were to put my arm on the barre !,"well , as you can see i am not excactly a happy camper .","i 'm glad i wrote this , it was fun .","my fingers feel like they are going to fall off , but i 'm sure i need to get used to that .","well , i 'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on .",it 's peter and the wolf .,we 've done it before .,it 's going to be cute .,"i was the duck , my friend sarah ( who goes to south west ) was the bird .",she was a great dancer .,"she was strong and very precise , she danced the lead in the nutcracker ( not clara , but the dew drop ) she shared it with elizabeth who dance the cat .",elizabeth is a beautiful dancer she has such grace .,"she was going to go to oklahoma on a scholarship , but she ruptured her disc and ca n't dance for a year , so she stayed home .","my other good friend is ginny , she 's a sophomore .",she is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older .,so those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet .,"i love ballet , we also have this one dancer named vanessa , she has extension to die for .",that means her leg goes all the way to her ear .,she is great .,"i love ballet , that makes me so happy .","well , thanks for this assignment , i 'll see you in class , but i doubt you 'll see me

i was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because i 've never really done anything like this .,so i decided to put it off until the last minute .,it is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due .,im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience .,so far i havent really met any new people that i would actually fraternize with on a regular basis .,i think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ut .,it is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends .,"although i know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college , which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships .",i do n't know i guess will just have to see how things turn out .,one thing that i am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here .,in fact she is a mere stones throw away in lld .,she means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier .,"i mentioned lld well that is a girls dorm , near llb which is my dorm whitis court that i now call home .",whitis is a nice little community although i do n't much enjoy some of the company here .,the rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in jester .,however its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own .,"it seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution , with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor .",i guess its just one more thing ill have to get used to .,not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now .,i am also planning on joining the marine corps and going to the plc course this summer .,it is a big step in my life and im a little unsure about it right now .,my father was a marine and his father was in the army and i feel somewhat obligated to serve my country .,one thing that i would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could .,me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college .,it seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family .,i know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go .,hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well .,"he came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him , it was a little upsetting .",i really do love and care for my family but i believe they think much to the contrary .,"i guess i do n't show it very well , or give them much common courtesy .",this short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much i miss them ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.424007 -0.435747 0.348112 -0.10072 -0.104521 0.852796 1.120742 1.097639 1.274896 -0.533646 -0.113564 -0.590446 0.476574 -0.130981 -0.039349 0.0 -0.04277 -0.745765 -0.684273 -0.491961 -0.854443 -0.742368 0.049011 -0.870904 -0.624052 1.339404 0.592378 0.223933 -0.769511 -0.828364 1.136192 -0.557182 -0.200006 2.26866 -1.017959 -0.631463 -0.979607 -0.044182 0.523101 -1.415806 -1.038726 0.408535 -0.196987 -1.447805 -0.203174 -1.205348 -0.705083 -0.208114 -0.176858 -0.557514 -0.706502 0.129872 -0.42008 -0.385372 -0.890828 0.109067 -0.751813 0.663006 1.655227 0.159201 -0.555106 -0.449078 -0.480161 0.296167 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.34221 -0.905719 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.064233 -0.422267 -1.221886 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.31363 4.482686 4.152406 4.790199 4.856216 4.833139,1627

well its sunday night and i 'm just chilling in the room .,i 'm enjoying not having my roommate here .,it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone .,that 's what my roommate does .,instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day .,i guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever .,as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever i want then we have no problems .,last night was pretty fun .,i went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience .,i kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he was n't that good of a dancer because he could n't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways .,the funnest was on friday when me and kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party .,we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that i met at camp texas .,he was a counselor that i had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever .,i really did n't think anything of it at the time because i thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so i kind of kept my distance .,i e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me .,"he did , which was good .",i was hoping he would .,i think i kind of like him but i have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so i 'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it .,and plus he is the guy and i grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so i 'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started .,maybe that 's my problem .,when i want something i tend to let it come to me and i just wait around till something happens .,maybe i should go after the things i want .,"speaking of things that i want , i applied to be a texas lasso .",i got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview .,i was so excited .,i have wanted to join something like this ever since i got to campus .,"they do everything , from socials to community service .",i heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past friday .,he is an iron spike and he suggested i look into it because he thought i would enjoy it .,and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe i could be able to hang out with joe a little more but whatever about that .,i really hope i get in to this because i really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that i can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that,i have been recently hanging out with kayla who is one of the girls i met at orientation .,we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now .,that 's why i want to get involved in something of my own so i wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me .,that 's not what college is all about .,"its about having fun and enjoying yourself , not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate .",she is trying to get involved though .,she signed up for the rowing team so we 'll see how that works out .,it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat .,i 'm no one to judge .,i have got the music on my computer going and the tv so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while i sit here and type for twenty minutes .,i have like five minutes left so that 's good because i 'm kind of getting tired of typing .,"tomorrow me , kayla , and her roommate sheik are going shopping at barton creek mall !",i am very excited about that because i love to shop and i want some big sunglasses .,i have seen lots around campus and i want some of my own .,i really do n't want anything else but u never know once you get going .,i 'm a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because i will buy them and add to the collection in my room .,its going to be fun whether i get stuff or not because i just love shopping in general that 's why my major is retail merchandising .,i will get to shop for a major company like mace 's or nordstrom or even tiffany 's .,that is my dream .,i want to have a base office in new york city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company .,i want to eventually be head person because i do n't like being under someone else 's control .,but i know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe i will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams .,my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but i think not yet .,i do n't want to miss anything up here .,it is

"well , i 'm sitting here at my computer right now doing my assignment for psychology i guess i 'm really thinking about a lot of things right now , primarily what my plans for the weekend are going to be even though its only tuesday i am already worried",about something that 's going to happen several days from now sometimes i get ahead of myself i guess i really like this assignment because i like typing i feel it is one of my strong points but i have n't got to practice much since my high school typing,course i was best in the class back then no one was as good a typist as i was there was a really good looking girl that sat next to me in that class her name was mary she is dating someone older than i am right now his name,is vincent i do n't know what his problem is he is too old for her and she is not even in college i bet he is n't faithful to her at all that is the problem with these frat guys they do n't respect anyone but themselves i wish,they would take some time off from their drinking sometime and think about who they are really hurting its not fair to the other kids mary 's age not to get a chance to get to know her because she is so caught up with this college guy that is,n't even loyal to her what a jerk oh well its not really my problem anyway i 'm in college too high school is behind me even though i had a really good time in high school i miss all of my friends we really had some crazy times it,seems so long ago that i was sitting in my senior english class staring out the window thinking about life at ut who would have guesses that when i got to ut i would spend time thinking about what i thought about in high school my friend is in the,"room right now he is a friend of mine from elementary school he went to the provisional program but did n't make his grades he goes to acc now and i think he is happy there the classes are n't too difficult , i hear i wish my classes were","n't so hard i feel too stressed if i do n't make good grades , my parents are going to kill me one thing i just noticed is that i noticed that i am randomly using punctuation i do n't know why maybe i punctuate the things that i think",are more important to me i guess that 's why i 'm in psychology maybe i will understand these things one of these days i think i will learn a lot in psych .,as well as all my other classes they are all very interesting to me they are all liberal arts classes that will help my degree actually i do n't even know my degree yet it will probably be in either government or history because i want to go to law,school and my academic advisor said that those majors would be most conducive to my acceptance to a prestigious law school but the thing they said that matters most was my grade point average he said that anyone with a high gpa can get into law school regardless of their,major so that was good to hear it took a lot of pressure off of me to make a decision i do not really want to make for a little while anyway both of my parents are lawyers i wonder how much that affected my decision to pursue a career,"in law i guess i will discover that as well sometime during this course i am very excited to be enrolled in this course i think i will discover a lot about myself well , my twenty minutes is about up i think i am going to order a pizza",now i still have not eaten lunch and i am starving ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.174395 -0.431528 0.210792 -0.292046 -0.043647 0.613388 0.404697 0.266349 0.566712 0.064645 5.006799 -0.590446 -0.855968 -0.120752 0.334731 0.0 -0.04277 0.593278 0.588359 -0.561574 0.469537 -0.742368 1.161159 -0.097035 -0.09705 -0.46341 0.266629 -0.410196 -0.946146 -0.824869 -0.755517 -0.084187 -0.617011 0.31731 -0.463463 -0.372765 -0.91624 0.009428 0.265493 -0.929934 -1.038726 0.538458 -0.145477 -0.860231 -1.11449 -0.242882 -0.494815 0.07887 -0.763833 0.566418 -0.359765 -0.224559 0.097204 -0.511544 0.379458 -0.93358 -0.009047 0.29214 -0.72089 0.059829 -0.018861 -1.008735 -0.039183 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -2.285866 -1.010943 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.103862 -0.451544 -0.408772 -2.191328 4.806274 4.044985 5.041382 5.057241 4.86544,1155

stream of consciousness ?,how do you start something so vague .,"i keep a journal which i write in occasionally , but i can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts. `` i 'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness , because that is definitely",what i am feeling right now .,it 's late monday night and i am taking this time to break up the reading that i have fallen behind in .,"while i am technically still studying psychology , it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text .",what is the point of this assignment anyway ?,how could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind ?,i guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject .,the human mind .,there really is no other single entity ( besides the female mind ) which is so complex and irregular .,"humans are an interesting study , which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology , sociology and history .","but psychology really is the king of the social sciences , it 's all but required for a college student .","i could n't believe how stereotypical i felt when i uttered the phrase `` my psych class '' , it 's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet .","now that i mentioned the greek societies on our campus , i 'd like to delve into that a little .","after overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of kinsolving today , ( they travel in packs ) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that sororities and fraternities actually limit social interaction .","sure it 's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick , but i honestly do n't feel compelled to join a fraternity .","free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season , but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality .","fraternity issues become the mindset of the member , and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person , be they in the same frat or not , is almost always taken advantage of .","yes , some fraternities do some good community work , but it limits people into one train of thought , their loyalty is admirable to the members , but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded .","of course , coming from a freshman non-frat male , that sounds like every other person with an opinion , ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality .","i really do n't oppose the fraternity'sorority concept , because it is a need some people truly need filled .","but the sight of another party where 70 % of the attendance is male , 20 % are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people , and the other 10 % are passed out , it makes them all seem the same .","i feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody , but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the kappa party or the pi phi foam bash , but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked",out of those parties .,"i feel definitely stereotypical again , from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties , could i possibly be the more prototypical male ?","well , here 's the sinker , it 's time to discuss sports .","i cover them for a newspaper , but honestly i 'm just like another fan , but willing to put in the work .","too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio , it 's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space .","any fan with a computer can put together that the cowboys are in a rebuilding year , but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices , meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story .",i guess i am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take ' about the latest controversy regarding sports .,"that 's not to say that all of them are garbage , but too many of them i find repetitive and dull , and bringing nothing new to the argument .","covering a sport is different than giving an opinion , and i enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air .","i love the hunt , and that not only makes me strange , but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer .","of course , as a college freshman , i really do n't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling , but i figure the experience could n't hurt .","much like my decision to take this psychology class , it may seem stereotypical , but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others .","my time is up , i am sorry to whoever is reading this , it must seem very much like the others i 'm sure , but i look forward to this class and i thank you for this very interesting assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

our world is pretty fucked up .,"i 've been watching and reading the news lately , and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with .","well not the only thing , but almost the only thing .","the world has enough problems with natural disasters , why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves .","between hurricane frances and soon to be hurricane ivan , why do we need chechen rebels , and radical terrorists , and radical governmental regimes to make things worse .",why is it that people ca n't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right .,"be it a christian , a muslim , or an atheist , every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong .","so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen , but also , others make excuses about it too ?",`` they 're religious .,they 're unstable .,they 're on medication .,they 've had a hard life .,man fuck that .,"people need to first take responsibility for their actions , and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what 's wrong is wrong .",i do n't understand this blur of morals and truth .,how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being does n't know the difference between right and wrong ?,"i suppose i 'll get off my soap box now , i just ca n't fathom the world getting worse , and yet i know that tomorrow , will be even just a little bit worse than today .","the only thing i can do is try and change my own actions , my own beliefs , and hopefully lead by example .","so i was just reading bush has tried cocaine , while bush senior was president .",ha .,"that makes me laugh , i say more power to bush , he says he 's clean , i believe him , i do n't think his past should be this big of an issue , especially when he is running against john kerry .","i do n't even want to vote , but i feel its my duty .",so who am i going to vote for ?,its like picking the lesser of two evils ?,and which one is lesser of a sob than the other one ?,man i do n't know .,"i suppose i 'll vote for bush , being that this is texas .",but i do n't know if i 'd feel right about that .,maybe i 'll just write in a vote .,i mean i know all of texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter ?,maybe i 'll run for president one day ?,"naw , i doubt it , i 'm not moderate enough .","not that i 'm a radical , just that i do n't think i could say things to appease one person or another .","i have my beliefs and damn it , i 'm sticking to 'them .","that does n't mean i 'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments , but i 'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes , that 's a fucked up way of doing business .",this feels good by the way .,"i 'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me , they 're very loud and annoying .","i kind of want to say something to them , but then again they 're very large men , and , since i 'm making snap judgments , they 're probably alpha males who would want to fight me .",so i 'll just let them be .,my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently .,"they 're a couple years older than me , and i 'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her .",she dumped him because she did n't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together .,"i can understand and appreciate where she 's coming from , but he was tore up about it .","anyway , they 're here and talking about stuff , i can tell things are getting intense .","i did n't even know they were going to be here , and technically i was here first so i suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal .","she will probably start crying soon , and he will just shake his head because he does n't know what to do .","man , i feel sorry for them both .","he just wants to love her , be there for her .","and she does n't want to hurt him , but she has no choice , she is n't in the same place he is .",love is a funny thing .,love is a fucked up thing too .,i 've only been in love once .,and i 've fallen out of love once .,its a painful process .,"but then again , i would n't replace it .","it was a profitable , great , shitty , learning experience , one that i can completely support .",so why is it that humans love ?,or choose to love ?,or choose not to love ?,"i 'd like to be able to love someone again , that 's a good feeling .",to be able to call someone and just talk to them .,"see how their day was , what they 've been up to , and to know that they wanted to talk to you , and ask you about those same things .",i wonder what my wife will be like ?,i wonder when i 'll meet her .,my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married i think .,"i may be wrong , but i doubt it .",i think they 're both in a place where they 're ready to commit for the long haul .,that 's kind of scary .,"hey , my brother is going to be married forever .",i 'm going to have a sister in law .,maybe i 'll be an aunt or uncle soon .,now that is really weird .,its crazy how time moves .,"i feel like graduation was a long time ago , but at the same time i feel like i still think and act like a 6th grader .","oh 6th grade , those were good days .",i thought i was the coolest kid in the world .,"and at the time , i may have been right .",i was one cool 6th grader .,it rained today .,"i love the rain , its so refreshing , so new , so clean , so pure .",it makes me appreciate the day that much more .,i 've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today .,"reading , writing , talking , thinking , listening , all things i can support 100 % though , so it has n't been a wasted day in the least .","i ate at freebirds today too , that was so good .","i 'd say the feeling i have after i eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings i 'll ever have to being completely content , lacking absolutely nothing in the world .","because when i 've finished freebirds , i do n't even desire love , because i am so full and content i do n't need anything else .",its a good feeling .,i 'm thinking about what i 'm thinking about writing .,if that makes sense .,"it is supposed to be stream of consciousness , and i 'm working on that , but i think that i 'm thinking too much about it .","i 've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point , now i 'm thinking too hard about writing something .","its ok though , because i only have like 15 seconds left .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

it seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and i lack control over when that thought surfaces .,"i have other current obligations , e. g. find a job , do some reading out of my books , clean my room , do laundry , call my mom , find my friend , arrange for a ride home , i need money .","i can list what i need to do but once i get around to it , that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus .","i ca n't focus on doing anything else , except think about that one thing .","well , that one thing is my boyfriend back home , and funny as it may seem , i think he 's the one i 'm going to marry .","this relationship is just too good to ignore , so i wonder about him a lot .",we have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong .,"i 've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life , mainly because that 's the way his mind functions and i noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend 's personalities and mannerisms .",i still have a better work ethic than he does .,but he gets very distracted while doing work that he 's not quite so interested in .,"i suppose also , i 'm always waiting on him to send me a message , email , or give me a call .",i am a rather independent person .,"i do n't like to hang out with the same people a lot , and i do n't like to do group work , study with other people , walk to class with other people , but i rather spend a day locked in a 4 x 4 ft box",with him than be away from him for a week .,now that is what i call companionship .,i have n't had a best friend like him since i was 7. i do n't think i would be thinking about him so much if he did n't ' live 4 hours away .,another thing that concerns me is the way i have organized my higher education .,"i have n't really picked out a major , i 'm not even on a reasonable track .",i 'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what i like to read about but i do n't ever plan to have a career in social sciences .,"i like math too , and i want to take more calculus , and maybe computer science classes , even though i do n't plan on majoring in any of those .","my major is communications , which requires me to take a lot of writing and english classes , and i absolutely hate english .",i wanted to go to ut because i wanted to learn more .,"i like some of school in that i like to be more aware , conscious and be exposed to new ideas that i would have never thought existed .",but the way ut works is you 're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements .,we are learning in order to work .,why ca n't we learn just to learn .,maybe i will be a social science major ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.793302 -0.214304 -0.471631 0.014244 0.385601 -1.081067 0.240575 -0.11232 0.200048 -0.537433 -0.095627 -0.590446 0.195989 -1.023701 0.252808 0.0 -0.04277 -0.372707 0.021089 0.421025 0.135629 -0.446894 0.178368 -0.545316 -0.624052 0.930031 0.105045 0.379458 -2.153279 -1.567156 -1.100231 -0.555534 -1.411168 -0.906028 -0.297114 -1.109326 0.984985 0.284109 0.909209 -0.446188 3.30973 0.253584 -0.505368 -1.445757 -0.610419 -0.528831 -1.093488 0.084409 0.374161 -0.038025 -0.063597 -1.739665 -0.678949 -0.232157 0.462656 -0.486345 0.625391 -0.954251 -0.421194 0.472066 -0.275004 1.47514 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.470558 1.301825 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.707831 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.227042 4.7847 3.463477 4.503462 4.401708 4.91807,1322
so here are twenty minutes of brian 's thoughts .,"as i sit here , i am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans .",today i talked to a coworker about religion .,he found out that i 'm agnostic and proceeded to proselytize .,"i can respect this , because his religion dictates that people who do n't accept jesus christ will go to hell .","but at the same time , i poked several holes in the christian philosophy and in the bible .","he was n't able to counter my arguments , and he responded only by saying that he has faith .",this epitomizes human ignorance .,i have faith the chair i 'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me .,"this faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to , in fact , exist .",yet he claims he has `` faith '' in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they 've seen .,i can just as well assert via faith that there is a pink elephant on the other side of the moon that we 'll never see .,"i 've never seen this elephant , but i know it 's there .",i have faith .,it speaks to me through the elephant spirit .,what the fuck is that all about ?,how can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this ?,it is incomprehensible to me .,i realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes .,"nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space , so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning .",never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that !,who needs logic and reason anyway ?,and it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion !,it scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they 're so incompatible .,it makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid .,"thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion , albeit at a crawling pace .","and even so , rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion ( absolute truth , mind you ) to fit our current society and way of life .",i 'm dumbfounded .,it also amazes me how closedminded people can be .,i 'm gay .,big deal .,yet many people ( though a few proportion in austin ) perceive me as evil for it .,my actions are vile and disgusting to them .,"never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature , though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior .","and do n't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical , reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality .","people have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to `` recruit. `` at the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts , i ca n't believe how moronic our society is , on average .",we even have al gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons .,"( hmm , are my two pet peeves of the day related ?",of course !,") j. and so i 'm left sitting here , wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace christianity and oppose homosexuality .",ugh .,these are the times that try men 's ( and women 's ) souls !,which brings up another point .,i 'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is .,"the craze in the past decade has been political correctness , and conservatives are sick of it .",but things have n't changed nearly as much as people think .,"i still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described ( a banker , an investor , a ceo ) as he .",he .,he .,i ca n't stand it .,but perhaps it 's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree .,perhaps they 're simply trying to convey the way the world really is !,because women do n't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society .,"in finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of procter and gamble and home depot , inc. out of some two dozen positions between the two companies one person was a woman !",i ca n't stand it .,i feel like i 'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people !,"( keep in mind , i 'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities , perhaps just in my mind .",hehe .,") and , not that i 'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class , this is all psychology !",it 's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything .,"with regard to religion , as survival machines for our genes , we 'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely .",this manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life .,"and we 'd like to believe that our existence is n't arbitrary , so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning , ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents .",with homosexuality .,gay people do n't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality .,"of course not all do , which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has .","and so on some level i 'm sure we 're afraid that if we accept homosexuality , more people will `` choose '' to be homosexual .",then the species will die out !,oh no !,"( i know per richard dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level , not a societal level , but you see my point .",") anyway , i suppose that 's my time for this week .",tune in again next week for more ramblings from brian 's ultraliberal mind ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today is a bad day .,my boyfriend and i of 2 years just broke up because he is at another university and is rushing right now .,i have always been the center of his world and now he acts like he does n't even want to talk to when except for when it is convenient for him .,his roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me and when i first heard that i got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the restroom .,"jared , has been the ony guy that i have ever loved and i thought i would marry him .",we spend holidays together and i am already a part of his family and he is part of mine .,to think of him being with someone else just kills me and i am so torn up right now that i can not concentrate on anything but him .,i had to end it because i can not continue to be hurt when all i have done is devote my whole life to him .,he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had together .,my thoughts are horrible right now and i never thought that i could feel so hurt and ashamed .,my biggest fear is that he wo n't even care because he will just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other girls .,jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he was always worried about me forgetting about him .,"he was always the one that could n't stand not to see me for one day , and he was so in love with me tat sometimes i got annoyed by it .",now the tables have completely turned because i feel like i am incapable of functioning without him .,"for the past 2 years , everything has been about him and so now i just do n't know what to do with my time .","where do i even start without him there to say i love you at night , or without him there when i am having a bad day ?",this is the worse feeling i have ever felt and i just wish he knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day !,he will probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks .,"i helped him move into his new apartment and was not invited to come since , but all of our friends have gone over there and seen him , so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that position ?",i have not been real happy lately as it is because i just transferred to ut and i hate it so far .,"i do n't see anybody i know during the day and i feel so lonely without jared , and now it will be permanent .",this is the worse time for this to happen and it makes me feel sick when i think about how it probably wo n't change .,we have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now there is nothing perfect about us and all i feel is pain .,he is going to the school that i did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while i have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what i get for it !,i kept telling myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about him every day .,"i am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help me during down times like this , but they have never seen me like the way i am today .",i have seen other people hurt this bad and i just thought to myself that it must suck to be like that and now here i am in their shoes .,"he is the guy that has always put a smile on my face , made me feel loved and made me a better person .",i go to sleep at night thinking of him and i wake up in the morning thinking of him .,we have had problems before and after a few days he could n't stand fighting with me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad .,"i keep telling myself that if we do n't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me , but i have such a bad feeling that this time is different and he will just",move on .,"i do n't want to move on but i have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people because when i think about it too much , it tears my heart up .",this is the guy that i have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has already given me up .,we have all the same friends and i will not be able to hear about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until i start t feel better .,i have no energy and it scars me because i do n't even want ot do my homework of study because my mind is in such a different place right now .,he has put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting people .,it just kills me to think that i am here and he is there without me because i have always been included in everything he does .,now all of a sudden i am shut out and i hope he realizes that he ca n't live without me .,it is so hard for me to think of him with somebody else because i know everything about him and what he likes and does not and i do n't ever want another girl to be that close to him .,"i love jared so much and i wish he would n't have ever left or that i would have stayed there because things could be different right now , but he enjoys making me jealous when he talks about all the things he is getting to do .",i know that i must just live day to day knowing that things will get better but right now i ca n't see myself getting over this for a long long time .,"i feel worthless today , am i am a very good person so what did i do to deserve this ?",i am just hoping and praying that things can be patched up between us one day after we both

morning and all i could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as i do .,i am only wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if i will ever be on his mind because i usually know what he is doing all the time .,i am supposed to be the one who goes to these parties with him and i am supposed to be with him when he meets other poeple so they know that i am his girl and now all these girls that have been in love with him while we have,been together are going to love that we have broken up .,i am going on and on about how upset i am its just very hard because i had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being without him .,"and as for school , i hope it gets better it will just take some adjustments .",i hope jared still loves me as much as he always has !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

okay i really do not know what to say frankly i have never done a writing assignment not knowing what the topic is or what ia m expected to write but all i know is that i have to write or type for the next twenty minutes which for me,seems like it is fairly a small amount of time since i type really slow .,"anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class , no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice .","i love psych , i actually want to be an elementary counselor , i guess i choose this because my parents split up and i guess i want to help students or young kids to understand this whole mess .","it really does not matter anymore although to be frank i wish things were the way the were before , not for me but for my younger sister she has suffered a lot from the desicion my parents made , well actually my mother , but who is to blame",", i guess that is all in the past and i ca n't change that .",well enough of that i am really glad that we can just type and type just letting our little heads just take us somewhere i reall appreciate this since i am not worried about how this will be graded i think i just have a little anxiety when it comes,"to papers , i guess i have to get into the idea that college is totally different form high school .","i think my problem is that i know that everyone is expecting a lot from me since i am the first in the family to attend a big university , both in my dads family and in my immediate family .",i am afraid of letting them down sometimes i really ca n't take it but i just know that everyone is behnd me i guess that motivates me and at the same time that kind of puts a bunch of pressure on my shoulders .,"i guess it is because my brother is or should be like a junior but i frankly think that he is just being a drain in the economy , i mean i probably saw him studying once in a whole semester and that was probably just cramming for his final",exams .,right now i really do not know whta ha plans on doing he just simply needs to get his act together not that i always do but at least i know that i wo n't hurt my parents the way he does .,i guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin .,she would just so die she would never think that i lied to her telling her that i would be living alone .,"i really feel guilty do not get me wrong but what can i do if she would have opened herself a little towards me then i would have probably told her , who am i trying to kid i guess that is just my excuse i have asked my mom","several times already if she would let me get married and she said no , well she said wait at least two yeras i really do not knowhy i need to wait two years , she says that has nothing to do with my boyfriend which is true they get","along real good i really do not know if it is that he speaks spanish or if it is the fact that he is real nice , oh did i mention that he gets paid really good .","i do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad , i hope she understands a little .",i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on .,"when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad , and i really do not want him to find out yet , you see my dad is depressed , the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier , and he says i am like",his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already .,i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do not agree with the way i am living it .,"as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me , i hate when people say do n't get married because then you wo n't go back to school i will prove all them

really nice .,of course you do n't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm i guess but this is more private and i can work on the bills and homework alone .,maybe i 'll go out

is on now .,repeat of the mtv movie awards .,he 's not really a bad rapper assuming i can even even judge that music .,but he honestly is about the whole shock value of his music probably .,just like many of his little fans .,i have a really nice view of the septic area behind the aparmtments an dthe little balcony shows a wonderful scene of the vagrants coming out of the woods .,i got that last part from a couple of my neighbors .,"the one seemed really witty , another was very .","bubbly , and of course there was the one with a boyfriend .",they are really nice i hope to get to know them more .,wow its almost time to stop the whole stream of consciousness .,just four more minutes .,my nipples itch .,i think its because of the new shirt i 'm wearing .,wow that was kind of out there .,you know what 's funny assuming you were a person and could reply that is .,i hope i do n't become one of those people who just talks to themselves all the time .,but the funny thing is that i have

warnings about `` you have spyware and adware '' started coming up and then it started working really slow -- it took 15 minutes to open up the internet !,then after a while it would n't even do that -- it just sat there !,"so i tried to shut it down and it still did n't do anything -- but if i tried to start a program , it said `` this program can not open because the system is shutting down. `` so i unplugged it and let the battery run out .",computers are so stupid .,but i guess we could n't live without them .,i really hope i do n't fail this chemistry test tomorrow .,i 'm really nervous because it 's my first real college test and it 's also over some stuff that i do n't completely understand .,"my roommate is in the same class as me , but she 's at the pcl -- she calls it her home because she 's there every minute of every day -- i do n't know how she does it !",studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like i need a break -- she stays there for hours !,she 's really sweet though .,i so happy i got good roommates ( yes -- that 's plural -- i have 3 roommates -- i 'm in supplemental housing -- it 's not as bad as i thought it would be ) 2 of my roommates are really nice .,"the other one is kind of weird , but she 's hardly ever here -- she 's always at her boyfriend 's house .",that 's kind of rude to her parents though -- i mean -- they 're paying for her food and housing and she 's not even sleeping here .,the only thing i know about her is her name really .,that 's okay though -- at least she 's not using my computer all the time anymore .,when we first moved in she did n't have a ethernet cord so i said she could do her add'drops on my pc .,but then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes ( on my printer -- with my ink ) so at least that 's not happening any more .,andy roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the us open tonight .,that made me so sad -- i love andy roddick -- he has to be the sexiest guy ever !,i met him last year and the tennis masters series in houston and he signed my shirt -- me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled out andy -- he and his coach really liked them !,but i really wanted him to win -- he won the open last year and that was his first so i really wanted him to defend it .,oh well .,the guy he lost to was playing really good .,he played the same type of game as andy though .,"they were calling him a swedish andy roddick , but he 'll never be andy roddick -- he was n't cute enough .",chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester .,i 'm not really sure if i want to major in biology any more .,i think it might just be too much science for me .,"i thought i could handle it , but i just do n't know anymore .","i know majoring in biology will probably help me make a good score on the mcat , though .",i really want to get into med school .,i want to be a pediatrician .,it 's just so much school though .,oy !,but i think it 'll pay off .,i really want to do something with kids and i could do that and make money at the same time .,i mean -- it 's that or teaching right ?,and teaching is definitely not on my list of things i want to do .,my mom is a teacher and they do n't get paid half of what they deserve !,she works all the time -- sometimes she does n't come home until after midnight -- and she only works with 5th and 6th graders .,i mean --

"this is by far one of the most interesting assignments i have ever had to do not the first stream of consciousness assignment , rather the first time i have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web .",this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous .,it is as if no one is safe anymore .,"i am very hungry right now and i could really use a lunch break , but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury .","i am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place , i guess they need this many to accommodate 40 .","000 plus students , this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that .",i am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school .,it is obvious that one of the reasons ut has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take .,this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information .,in its own way it is rather sneaky .,"however , it is not necessarily a bad thing .",i am actually thinking of being a psy major .,i think i may double major with a ba in music and another liberal arts degree .,i sure am glad i switched out of my performance major .,i just did n't want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path i was treading .,there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved .,my stomach is becoming impatient with me .,20 minutes is a lot longer than it seems .,it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because i bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things .,in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up .,this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on .,oh well .,i wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year .,i do n't want to think about it .,it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen .,at least i know what to expect .,i am gradually running out of things to write .,this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept .,i think the radio show went well last night i hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we do n't look so incompetent .,i do n't think i spelled that right .,just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten .,probably why they do n't hire people right out of fourth grade .,my roommate 's hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple .,i told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity .,that word is soooo overused and really annoying .,sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card .,we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing .,"this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 20 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this , i apologize for the sloppy spelling , bad grammar and weak syntax .","i guess that 's what being a ta is all about , huh ?", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.942429 -1.873831 -1.030668 -1.449409 -2.01208 -1.721006 1.566432 1.576152 1.856564 -0.124688 -0.131614 -0.231791 0.139295 -0.72343 1.408919 0.0 -0.04277 -2.494811 -2.123659 -0.29101 -2.318992 -0.007151 -0.521824 0.039375 -0.624052 1.02598 1.767962 1.160886 -0.523523 -0.679664 -0.356857 0.021189 -0.003647 -0.026654 -0.121133 -1.109326 -0.586261 -0.642005 -0.305737 -0.402532 -1.038726 -0.268269 1.039515 -1.450863 0.268946 -1.262358 -1.093488 -1.146558 -0.908614 -0.698502 -0.814754 -1.657678 -1.1422 0.10888 -0.579134 -0.099495 -0.983705 -0.954251 0.577422 0.962086 -0.328852 -0.324786 -0.480161 -0.31252 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.249282 -0.754489 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.316131 -0.37208 0.343124 -0.422267 -1.486665 -0.451544 1.014274 -1.022968 4.479966 3.659237 4.220353 4.435105 5.03364,49

years old .,so they are quite a bit older than he is .,whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that .,i think they think we will get married

and can depend on eachother for anything .,she even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when i started dating david and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that she had a good feeling about this one .,meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time .,and so far she is right and i do n't see her being wrong any time soon .,i am glad that i still live at home while i am going to ut because i do n't know where i would be without her .,i am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at

i guess i have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class .,as i 'm writing i keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when i 'm supposed to finish typing .,i think about what i was thinking in class when you talked to us about this hw and how i wanted to talk about certain things while i was doing .,but actually i start thinking about what happened tonight .,we all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag .,i wish my roommate would listen to better music .,after capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired .,we put it to the vote and that 's what we ended up doing .,afterwards our president asked us to make this a dry event .,"i support him 100 % because one i do n't drink , two i do n't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time , and three i think that all the points that he made were very strong .",my roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself .,i think that they are wrong anyhow because as president i think that ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and i do n't think that there was a need for him to consult us .,it was an executive decision .,i 'm debating whether i should go outside to the pool with everyone else when i 'm done with that .,i was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it 's not going to happen but i will see her on monday so i 'm still happy .,this weekend i have lots of things to do .,i 'm running through my schedule for the weekend .,tomorrow i have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out .,i keep on thinking about what else i 'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is .,i have never really sat down and typed everything i 'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that i type just like i think ; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower .,my leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other .,but after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again .,we 'll see if we actually will keep it but i think we will .,i 'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside .,i think about everything else i could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing i really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something .,i am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though i would still have liked to see my friend tonight .,i kind of like this girl but i 'm not sure .,she 's cute and everything but we have n't really gotten to know each other well enough to where i can say that i like her but i do think that she 's kind of interested .,i also think about my friend who is coming up from southwest next week to come see and how she 's going to spend the night .,we have been friends for a long time and we get along great .,but the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so i 'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen .,i know that it ca n't be too much because i have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time i do n't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now .,if anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss .,we will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we 'll see .,i have the full intention of not having sex .,i never have and never will until the day i get married .,i have thought about being a priest for a long time so i 'm just waiting for god to give me my call and i will follow his will .,i really hope that he hurries up though cause i do n't have a lot of patience .,i think that i have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them .,i can be patient for certain things but i just hate waiting for people to give me an answer .,i know that god does n't count in that but i try to hurry him up .,one of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make god laugh all you had to do was to tell him your plans .,i 'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys .,i guess that it all depends on whether you are christian or catholic or simply do n't believe in god or have another religion .,i realize that there are a lot of people here at ut that simply does n't believe in god and i think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life .,i keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left .,i wish that everyone would be able to believe in god and receive the eucharist everyday .,it is the most amazing gift that god gave us .,it 's sad how some people just ignore god or sometimeseven laugh in his face .,this was what i originally wanted to talk about when i was thinking about what i was going to write in this paper .,i thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that i can write on but then i realized that i could n't do that because it would have been planned .,so i decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind .,for the most part i think that it worked because as i think back of all the things that i have written for the past 20 minutes i have gone through various different topics .,"ranging from drinking , to girls , to god .",i think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words .,i realize that the time is up and that i no longer need to be writing but i 'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting .,i notice that i almost finished a complete page of writing ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i just woke up and i am feeling so drowsy .,i just went to a belly dancing show yesterday and i am thinking about how fun it was .,"man that iranian guy at the club was so hot , i wish i could go up to him and talk to him , but i 'm too scared .",i feel like i 'd be rejected in two seconds .,"he did n't even look at me , or did he ?","that dirty old arab guy was freaky though , he kept asking me

to that guy on the second floor .,he was such a nice person and i have n't really met any iranians here .,i hope the iranians in the isaco club are nice and they are n't like all those fake iranian girls that dye their hair blonde and all have nose jobs and live at the mall .,"that reminds me of bahareh , she was such a rude , mean stupid girl .","she had no right in saying those things to me , and for some reason i ca n't get over it .","i am thinking of erfon , i wonder what happened to him , he reminds me of kourosh , i hope he does n't become afraid of me like kourosh did though .",i wonder why kourosh is acting like that ?,"i have n't talked to him in a really long time , he should n't be intimidated by me !",anyway my hand is beginning to hurt and my pants are really loose on me

fair that i 'm known as the not so good '' kid , even though i 've never done anything bad in my life .",i mean for god 's sake i 've never even gone on a date so why should they think i 'm the `` bad kid '' ?,i guess it 's because neema gets along with mom so much better .,"i really wish i had a good relationship with mom , it sucks how we ca n't get along ever .",she was right when she said yesterday that we ca n't stand each other for more than a few seconds a day .,"we just do n't understand each other , she keeps lecturing me and it pisses me off .","there is only so much one person

hope to repay him with success .","i hope he lives forever , i hope they both live forever .",my legs are beginning to hurt and there is a piece of hair that has fallen on my arm and it tickles me !,"for some reason , i woke up this morning and my hair was curly , it was the strangest thing , usually my hair is a giant nappy fro , but today it was pretty and silky .","ut is n't as humid as houston , and i 'm glad .","dude i really miss nasim , she is such an awesome person .","i emailed her the other day , but she never ever checks her email .",i wonder why i never call anyone !,"i feel so rude when people call me and tell me , `` uh how come you have n't called us that 's so inconsiderate '' but i 'm just not a phone person , i guess .","i really should call people back and let them know i care , i think i get this aspect of my character from mom because she does n't like calling people either .","it 's not that i do n't like talking to my friends , it 's just that i never think to call them .","i will though , definitely , today i will call sogol and ponta and nasim .",i will call stephanie and jennifer and batool .,well i 'm sitting in a room that is covered with various books and study guides and it 's all a bit overwhelming .,"i really hope i can handle everything , although , i seem to switch out of every class i think is too hard .",which is really a dumb thing to do because it means i ca n't handle challenges .,i really need to swallow my fear and just take risks .,i would take risks although all my friends are grandmas and they are so cautious that i think it might be rubbing of on me too .,i need to go find friends that do n't mind driving around campus at 2 a. m. but i do n't want friends that drink .,what on earth is up with drinking ?,what is so great about it ?,there is no way in hell i 'm going to drink .,"so many people have told me `` oh do n't worry marjon , you 'll start drinking when you get in college '' uhhh no i 'm not , i think i know myself better than anyone else knows me and i know i 'm not going to drink .","i do n't even think i 'm going to date , i 'm so afraid of rejection .",i 've been rejected a million times before in my own head that i ca n't fathom going out and actually trying to get a date .,"i mean i do n't really know if people reject me , i think i 'm being paranoid when i say that , sometimes a flicker of someone 's eye sparks me off and i think they do n't like me .","i guess that makes me kind of insecure , or paranoid .","sometimes i make too much of situations , i over analyze and i think that what was a casual gesture was a gesture of hate ?","i do n't know what i 'm getting at here , perhaps i am not a very good judge of character .",although if i were n't a good judge of character than i would have horrible friends .,"like nasim , nasim 's friends are absolutely terrible , they teach her bad things and they put holes in her brain .",she is such a pretty girl i wish she had stray away from that stuff and start studying so that she can come to ut .,"man if you have brains and beauty , that 's a big plus in this world , everything in america is aesthetic , i 've noticed that .",people are more inclined to talk to you if you are pretty .,people do n't give a crap about you if you are n't pretty .,it 's so superficial and stupid .,"i wish people 's inner beauty could shine

we do and stuff .,"i do n't think i 've ever kept anything from her , and i know she does n't keep anything from me because she tells me things that she knows would upset me , but she tells them anyway .","over these last few months , i 've grown to love her as a girlfriend .","weird , i know .","well , she feels the same about me and she 's planning on visiting for the first time sometime this winter .","i even get jealous when she talks about other guys , which is really weird , first of all because we 've never met in person , and second of all , because she lives over a 1000 miles away .",talking about her always reminds me of my other friend christina .,there 's another funny story behind this relationship as well .,"she was best friends with one of my good friends , yoon .","well , yoon liked this one guy named young , and they always hung out together .",christina and this guy brian hung out with them too all the time .,"well , brian started to like christina and she detests him , so she felt really uncomfortable alone with him .","one time , she felt so awkward , that she decided to call me , even thought we 'd never met or talked before ever , rather than have to talk to brian .",yoon gave her my number and told christina that i was easy to talk to and to get along with .,"well , christina and i ended up talking for over 4 hours that night .","every night since then , we talked on the phone every day for hours at a time .","if it was n't for her , i would 've averaged more than 4 hours sleep a day !",i began to grow very fond of her as well .,i got incredibly jealous when she dated my best friend allen .,he treated her like crap and that really upset me .,"they broke up after a month , but because he was best friend , i could n't ask her out .",i was n't sure what the consequences would have been .,"she moved to california in early june , and that was probably the most sad i 'd ever been in my life .","a few months before she left , i decided to tell her how i felt , and to my surprise , she felt the same way about me .","that actually depressed me even more , because i passed up the chance to be with the girl i wanted to be with most .","well , things do n't always work out the way you want them to .",one thing i 'm worried about right now has nothing to do with what i 've been talking about .,its my car stereo .,many people think i 'm weird because i have this fascination with naming my possessions .,"for example , my car stereo cost over 2200 and i named it veronica .",my tennis rackets have names as well .,my favorite racket is called excalibur .,"anyway , i 'm famous for my stereo because not only does it sound very nice , but it can shake your house from miles away .",hehe .,"well , my apartment that i live in is n't in the nicest of neighborhoods , so i 've been extra cautious about playing it loud so that people wo n't know its in there .","last night though , i was showing off to one of my friends and forgot about it .",a group of who appeared to be `` gang members '' walked past my car and everyone of them was staring at my car .,"i heard stories about how many people got their cars broken into , so i was really scared at that moment .",i 'm always looking out the window when i hear a noise now .,it 's getting kind of ridiculous .,"my roommate warned me about that , but i was too caught up in trying to show off to my friends .",i can only hope that it does n't get stolen .,i 've got a huge headache right now too .,i think it 's a combination of several factors .,"one , is that i have n't gotten any sleep .","another is that i am `` kind of '' sick right now , feeling a little light headed .",its also very hot in this house .,"i try to take naps after class , but i had absolutely no time today .",but at least i have the weekend to look forward to .,my eating habits have been rather unhealthy as well .,too much fast food and going out .,"its showing too , around the gut that is !","some people have started calling me `` jiggly jay '' , while others change it up a little and call me `` gigolo jay. `` i 'm not quite sure why they call me jay either .",my name is jason and i 've always gone by jason .,some things just do n't have an explanation i guess .,hope you enjoyed reading this ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

just cause more unneeded problems i am afraid .,"so i called him , he was a bad mood as usual lately .",i had already been feeling poorly lately and talking to him while he was in that mood was n't

was more excited to talk to me or something .,"instead he just upsets me more , and that on top of everything else just makes me cry .",crying is a good release though .,but i did n't want to .,"so

"i 'm sitting here , listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window , on my balcony at university towers and i 'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud .",a better question would be why could n't they attach it to another outside wall that is n't in the middle of my balcony .,i 've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life .,"on the one hand , i adore it because i 'm from chicago and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here .","if there was no air conditioning and i had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets , which i 've noticed an insane amount of , i 'd flip out .",why are there so many bums here ?,"i do n't really know what to do when i pass them because i feel really really bad and want to help , but it 's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they",do with the money and why are n't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place .,i just do n't understand why they are so attached to austin texas .,"true , it 's an amazing city , much of the reason i am here attending this school .",it has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by .,it just has the worst heat i 've ever experienced and i do n't see why the bums wo n't save their change for a bus ticket and go 300 miles north so they do n't sweat to death in the heat because they ca n't buy water and i,'m sure that 's not what they 'd buy if they could buy anything and i really do n't understand how their bodies are still living .,which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming .,it completely ruins the balcony .,there is no other place i 'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it 's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl i 'm trying to hit on than the balcony,"with an incredible view , but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and i sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me .",i think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly .,"i ca n't really say why , but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here .","the tv 's on , we just got digital cable and it 's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he ca n't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 15 dollars a month for the playboy",channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it 's soft core .,"true the girls are prettier , but is it really worth it ?",i think not .,he 's a bastard .,all he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour .,"the kid does n't move , he 's a ; ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is , no man , but it 's cool , it",'s cool .,the only time he 's not sitting there bothering me when i bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 3 on a week night and decides he 's going,to study the one night that i decide to try and get some real sleep .,"there are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it , which i am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book .","when i inquired why he was doing this and let him know that i actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was , no , it 's cool man , it 's cool , i wo n't keep you up .",as if it 's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on .,"the time is up and though i wish i could go on , which i easily could , i 'd like to say one last time that my roomate 's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening , gentle creek out !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.862261 -0.776711 1.202329 -1.15655 -1.509535 0.610054 -0.312552 -0.403215 -0.756382 0.674295 0.11092 0.472236 -0.377624 -0.783327 -0.023675 0.0 -0.04277 -0.992697 -1.828246 -0.22661 -1.989966 -0.373894 1.136775 0.380252 -0.624052 1.702162 0.289804 0.242465 -0.632204 -0.829235 -0.82081 -0.612174 0.001094 -0.906028 0.330445 -0.512278 -1.004359 1.250338 -0.735365 -1.134815 -0.586827 -0.998552 0.657856 -0.363469 0.102695 -0.278358 -0.60821 0.158963 0.061522 0.550698 0.053418 -1.124892 -1.303311 -0.921816 -1.026087 3.532779 2.376003 -0.449096 2.207815 0.176641 -0.555758 0.077699 -0.12271 -0.419927 1.717867 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.398342 0.011351 -0.073676 0.426641 -0.169256 -0.223194 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.367248 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.572673 4.421669 3.459681 4.152245 4.225815 4.970641,1797
well i 've finally sat down to start writing this and i 'm wondering where its going to go .,i do n't feel like i have a whole lot to say though i 'm sure i 'll end up babbling for the next 20 minutes .,its rather cold in here .,i turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold .,i 'm borderline shivering .,i suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as i expected texas to be .,feeling pretty hungry as well .,i have n't eaten since about 9am .,i meant to go get some dinner at kinsolving around 6pm but lost track of time and now they 're closed .,its really annoying how they close so early .,even if i were to go eat at 7pm i 'd end up hungry again before i go to bed and eating microwavable dinners does n't prove particularly satisfying or healthy .,this laptop keyboard is being a real pain as i try to type this .,i 'm not used to it at all because i just got this computer yesterday .,"my poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here , i suppose i should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark .",my roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet .,i 'm a bit bored as it is .,the whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing ( poorly i might add ) crappy punk songs .,judging by his volume and consistency i 'd venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good .,"unfortunately for him , and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite .","oh well , i suppose that is part of dorm life .","as i thought i would i 've found myself making use of suppose , although , and though a little too often .",i think that i think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences ( like this one ) .,i just realized i have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes .,there 's a paragraph break just for style points even though there are n't any of those .,speaking of hurting eyes i 'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile .,its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear .,i do n't feel any eye strain so i 'm hoping its a non factor .,"unfortunately , the fancy ( but cheap ) office chair i bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods .","and i find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner , both for my back and neck .",hopefully its something i 'll adjust too .,in retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea .,it makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this ( you ) .,there i go with the 'although ' again .,its really rather annoying .,my constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying .,for some reason i imagine someone with a british accent saying rather everytime i type it .,after i wrote those last few sentences i started thinking of pre-testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul .,which then of course prompted me to wonder how one ( you ) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style .,what does this say about me ?,"i do n't know , nor do i care .",although ( dammit ) i would once again venture a guess and say nothing .,boy time flies when you 're babbling and rambling .,i was hoping for some synonym there but it would n't come to me so i just let it go .,thank god i wo n't be taking much in the way of english courses the next couple years .,writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least .,i feel a headache coming on now .,probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 2 hours or so .,although ( i ca n't stop myself ) i 've sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects .,i often wish i knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so i would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing .,i recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by potassium deficiencies ( i think i butchered that but i ca n't be bothered to figure out how to spell it ) .,it actually works out nicely that the only fruit consistently in kinsolving is bananas although ( its unbelievable really ) they 've been a bit over ripe the last few times i went there .,well down to my last ninety seconds .,if you were or are hoping for something even remotely enlightening or insightful well you 're just flat out of luck .,so i 've managed to type random sentences here for the last twenty minutes and its worked out alright .,i did n't type out the last two numbers because i did n't want to look for them on the laptop keyboard .,and i 'm done .,yay .,now for more homework ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i feel like i 'm kind of pressured to do this thing right because it 's my first assignment for the class and i do n't want to mess up .,i hate that feeling where you think your doing something right but when you turn in the assignment in to the teacher they say that you did the assignment wrong .,especially when you ask the teacher how long an assignment'paper suppose to be and they say they do n't care but when you turn it in they tell you it 's too short .,well anyway i guess i 'm getting off topic .,i tend to do that a lot sometimes .,right now i 'm feeling a bit hungry cause i only ate a small bit of food for breakfast ( at 1:00pm that is ) .,yes i feel very well rested too cause i slept till noon .,speaking of food it reminds of this lady who works in the cafeteria at the place i 'm staying at .,i do n't like her very much because she said something about me in front of my face to another worker in spanish .,she assumed that i did n't understand what i said but let me tell you -- -i did n't take five years of spanish and not learn to understand the language .,also i did n't work with hispanic people and not learn how to pick up a few words here and there .,so what really pissed me off was not what she said ( which really was n't that offensive at all ) but the fact that she would say it in a language she thought i would n't understand and more importantly she did it while i was still there .,oh here i go about things in the past .,"i know i should just learn to let little things like that go but i can harbor a lot of my emotions for a long time , but they do eventually go away .",besides i 'm glad that i can know whether or not what i feel is justifiable .,never mind forget what i just said it does n't make any sense .,it 's hard to explain .,you know i wish i could type as fast as i think cause by the time i finish this sentence i 've already thought up of something else .,i think my mind thinks too fast i feel old .,i 've noticed that recently i 've begun forgetting a lot of stuff .,not important stuff but miniscule little information that i would normally remember .,usually i could remember a lot of pointless things but now it takes a little while for me to .,wow i wish i could write papers like this because the time just flies by .,you know what i do n't think i stuck with the topic .,i mean it is kind of vague .,i mean chances are if someone is sitting in front of a computer and you ask them to write about their feelings at that instant they 're probably going to be a little apathetic at that moment unless your referring to what they 've been feeling like through the date,because if that is the case i guess i can elaborate .,"so far i 've been kind of tense , worried that this assignment might be too boring to take the time to write i mean it is twenty minutes but i guess twenty minutes is too much .",also i was worried that the computer lab might be too full but it was n't and then i was worried that i might be able to connect to the site because i was afraid that the site might be down ( i 've heard horror stories about it ),i guess i worry too much but i consider more of an asset to my life more than a hindrance because the fear makes think of all the things that can go wrong so i plan ahead of time and think of the alternatives .,i wish i could say the same of my little sister but it seems like he never thinks ahead and about the consequences of her actions oh well times about up now my only fear is that the submit button will work properly ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.620929 -0.534121 -0.093039 -0.680363 0.019477 -0.851171 0.289366 0.73749 -0.163551 0.155524 -0.009746 -0.590446 -0.937733 -0.43226 0.229407 0.0 -0.04277 0.313778 -0.151475 -0.795527 -0.374046 1.893278 0.226448 -0.155716 -0.114789 0.892899 -0.173997 -0.430032 -1.23531 -1.990875 -0.43401 -1.430891 0.389144 3.034503 -0.482128 -1.109326 1.262957 1.390011 1.020175 0.454136 -1.038726 -0.172555 -0.441937 1.346725 -1.429535 1.974202 1.509858 0.149958 1.440805 0.483428 -0.869993 -0.225571 -0.26966 -0.648847 0.510439 -0.410144 -0.591134 0.852404 -0.21199 1.196845 0.122743 0.114342 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.161141 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.913443 -1.227885 0.064449 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.272527 -0.422267 0.517984 2.138633 0.61151 -0.894141 4.411401 4.163355 4.53994 4.745858 4.920652,439

of turning in assignments because they might be just plain wrong .,i 'm really tires of typing .,i just read what i typed `` i 'm really 'tires ' of typing '' that 's pretty stupid .,at least i know i

all this entire thing is going to be about is about my failing relationship with ben .,i think so many different things that i do n't know what to think .,i ca n't help but being hurt by him seeing another girl even though we both agreed that we were going to see other people .,"i just do n't see how he could still love me but be with someone else , i just ca n't because i do n't even have a desire to find another boyfriend or whatever .","i 'm hurt so badly right now , all i want in the world is for him to tell me how much he loves me and always will , but i do n't want him to say it only because he knows that 's what i want to hear .",i have to talk to him about this but i 'm so scared .,i 'm so scared that he 'll tell me that he just does n't love me anymore and that is going to kill me .,i do n't know what to think !,"i mean , if he ever really loved me the way he said he did , i do n't see how he could already be dating or talking to someone else .",i do n't know .,"i would n't mind him dating other girls , it 's just that it 's been a while since he 's let me know how he feels about me , if i know and truly know that he loves me and i get just the occasional reminder of his love",", then i truly do n't think that i 'll have a problem with him seeing other girls because i know that eventually i will be seeing other guys too .","but even if i was seeing other guys right this instant , then i would still feel the same way about him .","i would still love him as much as i ever did because when you truly care about someone , those feelings do n't just go away because the person goes away and if they do , then you never really loved the person anyway .","i just love him so much and i am sooo scared that when i talk to him tonight , i 'm going to find out what i 'm scared to death to find out .","and even if he does still care about me , things are just so complicated !","i mean , take when i come down for homecoming , yesterday he said he still wanted to see me but he did n't really seem very excited about it as i would hope , maybe he is but he just does n't like to show it , i do",n't know .,"but he 's talking to this girl and right now it might not be a big deal , and a month and a half from now , everything with her could have gone to crap or a month and a half from now it could have made its way into","being something more and if it is something more by then , is he still going to want to see me if he has her ?",that 's another thing i have to talk to him about .,i am so stressed out about this .,"it would make my day -- my entire life if things just go my way , if he just tells me and makes me truly believe how much he loves me then it will make me so happy because that means so so much to me .",it 's all i want in the world to know that he still loves me because i still love him so much .,and deep down i truly believe that he really does love me .,i do n't think that he ever lied when he told me how he felt about me so i do n't see how it could have changed after only a month or however long it 's been .,but sometimes i do wonder if love is just something that he throws around .,"some of the things he 's done and said seem so sincere that he could n't possibly not truly love me , but sometimes i wonder how easy it will be for him to forget about me and fall in love with another girl who is more convenient for him",but convenience should n't be the fucking issue .,the issue is his feelings for me and mine for him .,just because i 'm gone should n't make his feelings any different .,it can make other things different and i do n't expect him to sit around sulking over me and not dating anyone else for two whole years .,all i want is to be certain of his love !,that 's all i want !,is it so much to ask ?,"god , i 'm such a wuss .",i 'm sitting here crying over this and i do n't even know if he has given it a second thought .,sometimes i think i 'm the biggest loser for still being so attached to him but i ca n't just turn off my feelings .,"maybe his love for me just was n't as strong as mine for him , but he means so much to me and i care so much about him .",i 'm just so hurt and confused right now .,and scared .,"i know that i really need to know how it is and if he does n't care about me so i can move on , but i am scared to death to find that out because it is going to completely break my heart , i mean be completely devestating",if i found out that he does n't feel the same way i feel .,"oh my gosh , i need to blow my nose so bad .",i have so much stuff to do today .,i have to go by the financial aid office and the co-op to pick up my check and find out about a weekend job .,i need to work out and decide if i 'm going to go to ultimate frisbee tonight .,i need to study .,i just wish time would hurry and go by .,i ca n't wait til next weekend when my family comes to see me .,"i so wish ben could come see me , i miss him so much , but it just sometimes seems like he does n't really want to see me that badly , even though he says he still want to see me and he has told me that he misses",me .,i just think that he does n't think about it nearly as much as i do .,"i do n't know though , it 's very possible that he could think about it as much as i do .","i do n't show him how much i really want to see him , i mean , he knows i want to see him but he does n't know the extent to which i really truly miss him and ca n't wait until the day i get to see him",again and hold him again and hopefully kiss him again .,"i miss everything about him so much , i just ca n't get over it but still i do n't show that to him .",so he could want to see me just as much as i want to see him but just not show it to me .,he could still love me just as much as i love him but just not be showing it to me because i have n't been showing it to him .,"maybe he has n't said i love you because i have n't said it to him either , but i do n't say it to him because he does n't say it to me .",it 's possible that this is just a vicious cycle and that he really loves me and theres nothing to worry about .,i just have to talk to him .,"it 's possible that no matter how many girls he dates that he will still love me as much as ever , i just have to find it out .","by the time i get to see him again he may not have anyone else , he might be so excited to see me .",i do n't know ., , , ,

that i can sit and do the same drills over and over .,"i really like being in this room , i think that it is because it is a away from my room and into a house where everyone who lives here i am friends with .",so i always enjoy comming over here .,this is actually kind of hard .,i do n't think that i will be able to continually write in a stream of conciousness for twenty minutes .,but what the hell i am giving it my best shot .,now someone has walked in so i now have something else to tune out while i write this .,"well i think that , actually i have no idea what i was about to say

i never thought that college would be this overwhelming .,i went to three classes today and i went ho9me and cried .,how can i keep up with everything ?,i went through band week and i sometimes ask myself is band worth it .,"when i am tired and sweating and just want to go home , i think of my parents and how they can brag in my little home town and the feelings of walking through the tunnel at the game and see 80,000 plus fans .","at home 1,000 was the biggest turn out and that was big enough .",i am very nervous about the first game .,where i am from our school marches military and ut marches more corps .,i just know that i am going to mess up .,i am all excited about school only being thirteen weeks long but fear that one and a half years of high school work equivalency are jam packed into these thirteen weeks .,good news though .,i only have two finals .,that is marvelous .,i have to take a dumb sat ii test thursday from 7-9pm and that means that i may miss band which i can not .,i do n't see why someone who had five years of math in high school ( ) algebra in 8th which was a high school course offered for gt ) has to take a stupid test .,if i was n't good in math i would n't have had five years of it and passed nor would i be an engineering major .,who knows .,i called the department of mathematics and asked them about it .,i tried to get a number so my teacher could call and try to see of something could be worked out and they were extremely rude to me .,so i called the measurements and evaluations \center and they told me to call the department of mathematics .,my teacher said `` welcome to ut '' this is a wonderful idea to have a writing assignment of continual thought because i can just vent about the worst first day of class i have ever had in my entire life .,i have strong feelings that it will get better because it can not get worse .,i know that the first semester is the hardest but right know i do n't care .,"while i was studying , i was thinking about the kids that went off to college and came back at christmas and visited about their first semester at school .",everything they said does n't ' pertain to me .,nothing they said

something is if you love it you will work your darndest at it to achieve the highest possible .,"so i was thinking about if my calculus teacher asked me to come to his class what i would say if someone asked me why i did n't the ap test and if it were a smart decision , ( that was my cat walking across the key board .",) he wants outside because he knows that there are other cats outside and he wants to attack them .,he 's a 10 week orange tabby cat named bevo-talk about school spirit .,i think that i would answer the ap question as one that it is a personal decision .,my boyfriend ap out of 408c and said that was the worst thing he did .,some people are happy they did .,another guy from home ap out of 36 hours and went to m & a and came home because he failed everything but pe .,my \philosophy is that i need to start from the beginning in order to get used to things .,", so what if i have already gone over this in high school i do n't care .",why make things hard on myself with new material my first semester it 's not like i 'm going to graduate in 4 years anyway .,i figured that if i took my basic chemistry and calculus things i know that i could get used to teaching styles college life and testing style .,"i will have to study and i know this real well , but it wo n't be all new to me .","well i started at 10:35 and it 's 10:55. , i do have one question though , if we participate in more than five hours of experimental stuff for our semester requirement can we get extra credit for that extra hour ( s ) ?",that 's all folks .,good-bye and good luck ., , , , , , , ,

"i thought i would because i 've visited with my friends so many times before , but now that i 'm actually here it 's finally true .","i 'm away from my parents , it 's so great .",i live with three great girls in my suite and we 're so popular here .,"i 've always been a socially outgoing person , but now i feel like it 's going to work .","there are always large numbers of people in our living room , bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator ; everyone munches from it .",and it 's ok. the ra told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking ; she called her mom and was so upset .,i 'm so glad its not like that here .,we all contribute and all consume .,but it 's not like there 's always noise and party 's here .,only when we all decide .,"if one person wants to read or study or sleep , we 're really considerate .","i hope that lasts , i 'm pretty sure it will .","at our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because , come on , who minds a foreign accent every once in a while .","this guy from belgium and this one from england are always watching tv in our room , which is another amusing thing : we do n't have cable , or an antenna , or a vcr , so we only get fox channel 7. we sit around and watch whatever",'s on .,in one way it 's good because we do n't have arguments over which channel to watch .,maybe simplicity is the root of compromise .,we had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up .,it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room 's shananagans .,"this one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry ( he 's one of our friends- our referring to my roommate and i we 've been friends since 2nd grad , long time , huh ?",") anyway , he dropped like half a box of laundry detergent on the stairwell and no one noticed for a week .","the ra got mad and cleaned it up herself , but it was amusing because he does n't even live here .",another thing was the `` stolen furniture '' incident .,we are given this loveseat-type couch in our suite 's living room that can maybe seat 3 people if you 're lucky .,"and in the lobby of the 3rd floor in front of the elevator there are 2 large couches that just block the pathway , no one ever sits in them , and they could probably seat 5 or 6. so when no one was around , my suitemate and i",and 3 other people that happened to b in our room at the time helped us move our dinky little couch into the lobby which is down the hall and around a corner .,we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us .,now we have a nice couch that is well used and the ra 's are threatening to do a room check to find it .,why ?,its going to more use .,it 's all kind of a double standard anyway .,the head ra is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer .,he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and wo n't mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night .,"it 's pretty funny , one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint .",we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head ra stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded .,it probably would n't have been in his best interests to b seen in there .,"he 's only 20 , but the building is changing management , so right now he 's the head guy .",its odd .,i 'm 18. finally .,"i could be in a management position at the pool i lifeguard at in the summers , next summer .",it seems odd that i 'm really an adult .,"when you 're a kid u never think that you 're ever going to get to the point where you decide when to come home and when to do this and what to do in this situation , type thing .",its like the transition from high school to college really is that much of a change in that you 're independent .,"it feels so good to finally b independent , financially , physically , emotionally .",its wonderful responsibility .,"i am responsible for watching my budget , if i do n't , no one will bail me out ( well that 's probably not true but you know ) .","i guess i 'm trying out freedom on borrowed wings , i can always have that security blanket if i want , but i do n't want .",i want to be independent ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

so the first week of school has begun and i am not ready at all !,i already feel like i am loosing my mind .,which is not a good way to start off the school year .,i am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors .,"first , i am taking cms 306m , which is a speech class , and that does n't seem like it will be too hard .",then i am taking eco 304k with an amazing professor .,i am very excited about this class but i have heard that it is a little difficult so i will definatly have to pay attention and study .,i am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is troy kimmel-the weather man !,so i am excited about that because he seems like a fun person !,i am also taking edp369k which is a community service class .,we have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours .,i think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business'place and get to experience those things that we normally would n't .,this class should be interesting .,i think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish .,this class is just something i need to take .,"finally , i am taking your psy class which i am very excited about as well !",pennebaker seems very laid back and cool .,"with the music at the beginning of each class , etc .","i do n't know , i think i might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology ( however that is spelled ) .",i really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon .,i am a sophomore so i am not as scared as i was last year .,last year i was very intimidated so i studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return i ended up with a 3 .,888 ( which my parents are enthused about !,") but this year i am not as intimidated , so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing .",i just really need to get out of the summer mode where i go out every night and do nothing but work and party .,i need to calm down and study'read a bit more than i am now .,i think i will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days .,so hopefully ill get my act together soon .,"anyway , on a lighter note tonight was our first chapter meeting .","that 's right , i am in a sorority-alpha chi omega-and i love it !",we just went through rush where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing .,my little alpha sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever !,she knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time !,i just love her .,next week we get our chi sis ' and then a few weeks after that we get our omega sis ' then at the end of that we get to chooose our lil ' sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years .,so this semester should be very exciting !,this year i am living in the axo house with my pledge class of '03 and i was n't so sure about it last year but i really love it !,i am getting to know my pledge class so much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound !,haha .,"anywho , we have a date dash on thursday and i am not sure which boy to take !",haha .,i always seem to have boy problems .,"but o well , that 's all part of being a college student ( i guess ) .","anywho , there is this one boy who is a sigma chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around .",and really cute but then there is a wrangler whos name is matt who i kind of talked to last semester .,he use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started .,well even though he may be good to look at he really does n't have much of a personality !,which really sucks .,i think he 's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and does n't have a whole lotta interesting things to say .,"i mean , do n't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and i tottally trust him .",and he 's 21 ( haha ) .,but i ca n't help it if i am not attracted to someone .,i mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at .,but in a way i feel like i owe it to him to invite him to our date dash .,but then again i do n't want to lead him on and then `` break '' his heart .,because that 's just cruel !,"okay , then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend ( but in a good way ) .",he is super cute and very interesting .,i think i could hold several very interesting'intelligent conversations with him .,i think he could teach me a lot about life in general .,"anywho , my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this date dash and i would love to go with him but i feel like i owe it to these other guys , that i have been spending more time with .",so right now i am a very confussed person-and considering it is monday night i kind of need to make up my mind really fast .,"okay , so there 's the sigma chi-names forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality .",then there 's matt-the wrangler-who is so nice but i would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him .,then there is ryan who is someone i look very much foward to getting to know better .,so we shall see how things go .,i know everything happens for a reason so i will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out !,right ?,"well , i have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes .",i guess i had a lot to get off of my cheast .,this is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day .,just let it all out !,"haha , good idea !","o yeah , i tried signing up for an experiment project but then i realized i signed up for the wrong day so i hope that does n't affect my grade .",whopps !,"o well , there 's nothing i can do about that now .",this weekend is our first home football game which i am very excited about !,we play north texas and we should whopp some beee-hind !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i 'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck .,"how can i find the right truck that 's cool for me , is affordable , and will last without much repair .",well i guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market .,"that sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad , but there is one problem .",which is i am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers .,this gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are .,so far since school started i have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life .,i have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now .,"i want to do so much stuff like join a frat , hang out with friends from high school , buy a truck , get good grades , meet people , and keep up with my girlfriend in new york .",now that 's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times .,i got a girl that i 'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day .,is it possible that i can expect our relationship to work out ?,"i know i want it to , i know i want to see her and have things the way they were , but is that something i can manage .","are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out , or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together .",it just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time .,then i start wondering about my best friend who went to arizona and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends .,i miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because i feel i do n't act like my true self around new people .,"i am not trying to be fake with anyone , but i ca n't be comfortable and completely open around new people and i do n't like that .","i just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me , and never sell them out to new friends because i would be preety upset if that ever happened to me .","even though i got lots of new friends in my fraternity , they can never eplace the ones that i spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.340025 -0.480817 0.884956 -0.048535 0.184688 -0.109248 0.222832 0.4801 -0.471817 -0.764632 -0.013917 0.126864 0.565228 0.863522 -0.118809 0.0 -0.04277 -0.950325 -0.484308 0.576329 -0.355782 -0.742368 -0.039639 -0.014903 -0.624052 0.049495 1.924715 -0.308386 -0.897506 -0.169445 -0.594895 0.54332 -1.105366 -0.308241 -1.017959 -0.569442 -0.46364 0.208133 -0.583975 0.00325 -1.038726 -0.808436 0.397167 -1.061695 -0.967693 -0.780489 0.222956 0.586962 0.03608 -0.033626 0.823856 0.865992 -0.642705 0.160412 2.263346 1.428921 0.976356 -0.954251 2.237351 0.615409 -0.06246 1.434245 -0.480161 -0.156939 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.971258 0.086979 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.211246 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.779252 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.098727 4.92744 4.137939 4.582996 4.844782 4.128088,716

well here i am in the undergraduate library writing my stream of consciousness paper .,"i still have n't really figured out yet what i will write about , but i suppose that this type of paper is n't really supposed to have a meaning .","that 's good i guess , right .",sure .,it 's cold in the computer lab here .,it 's always cold in this lab .,and it 's always cold in the library .,"in most places throughout the university , in fact , it is cold .",it is especially cold in the student union .,i mean -- ridiculously cold .,it must be about 70 degrees in there .,"there is one place , however , that i have found is not cold - it is hot .",my calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really warm .,and it does n't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside .,"one thing i have noticed though , is that it is getting a little cooler outside .",this is very good news .,hopefully it will continue to get cooler .,"so looking at the timer at the top of this page , i am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long time , especially when you consider the fact that i really have no topic , nor have i even begun to write on a",topic .,it 's just meaningless facts from my mind .,i 'm sure that this has some kind of meaning - this writing i mean .,there must be some point for this .,hopefully at least .,so far my classes have been pretty good .,i do n't have a huge workload yet .,i assume that it will pick up eventually .,especially next semester .,"from laurel 's experience , i have a feeling that next semester will be quite a bit tougher than this one .","actually , i am quite certain that it will be rough .","i will be taking differential equations -- which scheffer said was hard -- and physics , which i know will be hard .","oh well , i can handle it .","i am enjoying school , though .",it is quite a bit different than anything else i have experienced this far in my life .,all the freedom and extra time .,i just like the atmosphere that is college .,it 's fun and different .,well only five minutes have gone by so far .,i 'm still a little hungry .,i should have had more lunch .,oh well .,"i only have one more class , and it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour .",that 's not too bad .,i am writing on a macintosh computer right now .,"i did n't particularly want to use one , but it was available , so i took it .",they are n't too bad i suppose .,it would take a little getting used to .,and the keys are quite a bit more sticky than i am used to .,and the fact that the mouse has only one button it a little odd .,but the thing that i find most interesting is the fact that microsoft internet explorer is on an imac .,i had always wondered if microsoft put out programs on apple 's .,quite interesting indeed .,now i 'm pushing the 9 minute mark .,"looking back , this is quite a bit of stuff i have written in the last nine minutes .",all pretty meaningless though .,i think i may just stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing .,you know the feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by .,quite annoying i must say .,during swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would remind us of how much time we had left in practice .,especially with coach hutch .,man he was a killer .,i think that was the hardest year that i ever had with swimming .,funny thing is -- i did n't get a whole lot faster .,i got faster with coach wilson -- as much as i hate to say it .,ok i give -- i looked at the clock .,now i only have nine minutes left to write .,that 's promising i guess .,i wonder how the swim team is doing now .,with the girls and the guys separated and all .,"i wonder if the girls like the new coach , and how the guys are dealing with kyle again .",the guy behind me has more i'm 's up than i have ever seen .,he seriously must be talking with at least ten people - probably more .,the whole screen is flashing and lighting up all the time .,crazy .,this whole macintosh thing is kind of getting to me .,i ca n't stand this keyboard .,it is so sticky !,"every other word , i have to go back and fix it because the key did n't register .",i also keep going back because i keep forgetting to add capital letters and such .,i am used to a program fixing it all for me .,oh well i suppose it 's good for me .,but this sticky keyboard is not .,geez !,"if you ca n't tell , it is starting to bother me .",and they crazy imer is still typing away to like 50 of his closest friends .,it 's funny what you notice people do when you just sit back and watch for a minute .,( 6 minutes left ) one good thing i will say is that macintosh 's do look pretty cool .,i like the whole clear theme .,i also like the widescreen .,"it 's pretty cool , and is very clear and bright .",i think the clock on the computer is slow .,after 20 real '' seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds .,"so for every `` real '' minute , 75 seconds go by .","so in a 20 minute writing sample , i must actually write for about 25 minutes .",see i thought this was an abnormally long time to write .,"i thought that my watch said 12:01 when i started , and now it is 12:37 and i still have 2 minutes to write .",maybe this thing loses even more time than five seconds for every twenty seconds .,that 's crazy .,i have a one o'clock class .,i hope that my `` 2 '' minutes does n't last too much longer .,"well in conclusion , this writing experience has been .",well .,real - to say the least .,"i have to say that i have never written a stream of consciousness paper before , so this was a first .",i do n't know that i like it that much either .,i have noticed that when i type on the computer that the seconds do n't even move at all .,so i have been writing for a loooong time .,"ok , my time is up .",bye ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.192667 -0.018368 0.094623 0.034093 -0.379784 0.402352 0.630391 0.80348 0.16347 1.677758 -0.218491 -0.590446 -1.159972 -1.343884 0.598893 0.0 -0.04277 -1.345652 -0.964383 -0.361823 -1.114935 -0.04012 -1.165459 -0.763091 0.352911 1.452415 -1.442035 1.403879 -0.564639 -0.034316 -0.88722 0.233466 -0.767561 -0.906028 -0.332672 -0.654177 -0.952723 -0.599505 -0.344502 -1.086121 2.061743 -0.509617 1.345084 -0.052123 0.711922 -0.096935 -0.353603 -1.34776 -0.254845 -1.260178 -0.126903 0.798915 0.121975 -0.688849 0.355954 -0.519609 -0.326977 -0.954251 0.326316 -0.153445 -0.357131 -1.234687 -0.480161 -0.497234 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.91169 -0.097139 0.102975 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.145079 2.131798 0.633956 0.158835 0.100563 -0.245665 0.838686 4.322047 3.748067 4.797064 4.829182 4.827215,2021
entering college is a whole new experience that is new to me .,one that is unique in its own right .,an experience that begins a new transition from the home to a life of individuality and freedom .,"being only three hours away from home , it did n't seem like i was breaking away on my own , but in actuality this is only the start of creating a new life for myself .","after high school , everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves .",one friend would move to new york and another would move to california .,the once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast .,"although ut is a new change for me , it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on .","from this day forward , i am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past i can put behind as memories .",the challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature .,"back in high school , i would hear stories of friends failing out of ut due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol .",everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own .,i would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home .,"these stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that i would not be like the rest , but an individual .","that 's what ut is basically is , just a group of individuals all with the same goal , a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives .",its like its own community at ut .,all students relatively the same age trying to create a future for themselves .,i sometimes wonder if i have what it takes to succeed at ut .,my mind is still in doubt seeing the enormous campus each day as i walk to class .,but all i can ask for is for my best and that is good enough for me .,"even though ut is a different city than my home town dallas , i still feel like i have n't left dallas in a way .",with all my friends attending this university it just seems like dallas all over again which is one of the reasons i was considering going out of state .,"it seems great to have a large number of your friends close to you , but in a way i have a desire to start totally fresh .","throughout campus , i would see students from my school walking up and down the street and sometimes wish that a whole new atmosphere was around me so that i can begin a life that is not attached to my old one .",the university of texas does however let you become any kind of person you desire with a new start even though it is kind of mixed in with the old .,"as for home , i sometimes wonder if my parents are doing well without me .","with their constant calls and visits , it seems like they lost a part of themselves when they had to let go of me .","so along with the stress that comes along with being a student at a ut , my stress also comes with the worry of how things are back home .","seeing my mom cry , tore my heart apart with the goodbye that completed my transition to ut .",i notice how people do n't show how lucky they are that they have an opportunity like going to ut but instead take it lightly as if its nothing when in fact thousands of dollars are being invested in you in hopes that you create a successful future for yourself,college is a whole new experience that allows you tremendous independence .,it is my job that i spend my time wisely and take advantage of the situation in creating something out of myself .,i see some of my friends just wasting their lives away on drugs and partying .,"i would like to do something for them , but their destiny is their own fate of what they and make out of it .",all i can offer them is my support .,"although fear did strike me before i entered ut , it now has turned into an excitement of a whole new world .",

so i do n't really know what to type about .,i hope this does not have to be like grammatically correct or anything because i do n't ever use capital letters .,twenty minutes is a really long time .,i do n't know if i can even type that lone .,i do n't know if i ever have in my entire life without stopping or taking a break .,is weird to write down what i 'm thinking because i think i try to think about what to write so i 'm not completely sure this is really what i 'm thinking .,i hope no one reads this too carefully .,so its always been really cold in my room but now its kind of hot .,i think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings .,i keep thinking about kurt and i wonder if i should call him back or not .,everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but i do n't even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did .,i think my foot is falling asleep .,i almost wish i had a desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small .,my hand keeps hitting the mouse while i type and it waves around in front of what i 'm writing and that makes it hard to concentrate .,"anyways , i do n't want kurt to think that i have been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first a pop up just came up on my screen .",i did n't think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp .,ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and i did n't want to because with all my pop ups i figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so i,tried to push the little x in the corner and it would n't close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work .,at first i thought it was for this maybe it was but then i got back to this screen and my time was starting all over .,that sucks .,i hope this is over soon .,anyways i 'm still thinking about kurt .,no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together .,he could just want to talk .,he did say the first time that he just called to see how i have been .,and i 'm still mad at him for what he did but i do want to forgive him because i just do n't want something like that hanging over me forever and i hate to hold grudges .,and i do want us to be friends and i know it would be hard for me to say i did n't want him back but even if that is what he wanted i would n't do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me .,plus i 'm in college and i do n't need to have a boyfriend back home .,i need to meet people .,but i really do miss him a lot .,i hope it gets easier .,which is part of why i will call him because i really need to close that part of my life and end it and i ca n't think of the word but something like finalize it .,i hope my battery does not die on my laptop and i hope that

glad i did because that was a lot of fun .,but i do hope he is not mad or anything and we can get together later .,i wonder if i should join the texas exes .,i do n't know if this is really what i 'm thinking because i know in the back of my head all i 'm really thinking about is how much i hate typing all this and how i ca n't wait until its over but at least i 'm doing,it today instead of tomorrow night so ill have it done and do n't have to worry about it .,i 'm going to try and not procrastinate .,bad start though i 'm only on chapter one in psychology those chapters are so long and

so here i am trying to figure out what it is that i am thinking .,maybe i should n't have given advice to genevieve about her mother .,i do n't really know the situation and even more than that the little that i do know .,i have never experienced .,adrian too .,he must really be having a difficult time dealing with the death of his mother .,"man , my finger really hurts .",the manicurist was trying to drill my cuticles off .,but they 're pretty .,i do n't know what i should do with the whole beta thing .,"they are all nice , but i am tired of being pressured into situations that i am not comfortable .",maybe i set myself up for it .,right now i am a little emabrassed because i am really hungry and these 20 minutes are not passing quick enough .,"i know the instructions say not to worry about grammer and spelling , but it 's really hard to read my own writing and have all these misspelled words pop up .",nose itches .,i wonder if i will be able to handle rush and my classes .,as it is i am already blowing off my other classes for organic .,"even more than that , i hope i get my financial \aid in on time .",i really do feel bad about making my father feel like he wasn ; t there for me .,my mom says that it 'll work itself out but this whole financial crap really is upsetting .,i know of families that have been torn apart beacuse of that .,all i know is that they 'll have my ass until i am like 40. which really sucks .,an education should n't be so expensive that once you get one and start a job you are so in the hole that you 're broke all the time .,maybe i should drop out and og to massage therapy school like i wanted to a long time ago .,i ca n't believe that i have n't heard from dannee .,i am really upset about what our friendship has become .,sometimes i even think of andy and i don ; t know why .,he 's probably happily married with a kid .,"( i am really glad that it 's not my kid , though .",cause then i 'd really be screwed with the whole moiney thing ) 5 more minutes .,i ca n't believe how little i have written .,i must be the slowest typer .,there 's my stomach again .,at least i do n't have any classes today .,that way i can print up my organic and biology and go home to eat .,even when i get there i do n't know how to react with genevieve .,she complains about her mother and then does the exact thing that she complains about .,i bet i do the same thing .,wow that guy is really talking very loud .,i wonder why ( 2 minutes ) people walk aroiund libraries talking so loud .,how inconsiderate .,i even had a wierd dream last night .,but i think if i were to think about it now my finers would not be able to type quick enough to write it in the last couple of minutes .,i wonder who called us this morning at like 7:30. good thing i was able to fall back to sleep ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.216202 0.03606 -0.046241 -0.299594 0.336156 -0.403108 0.092664 -0.339188 0.158325 -0.442767 -0.192767 -0.590446 0.186623 -0.825717 -0.158481 0.0 -0.04277 -0.145786 0.347679 -0.214651 0.309025 0.104126 -0.137307 0.014699 -0.624052 -0.588945 -0.84748 0.171029 -0.883398 -1.440098 -0.244346 -1.012928 0.301299 1.118908 0.014603 -0.652127 0.130452 0.49175 0.755002 -0.386628 -1.038726 -0.191749 0.020094 -0.040947 -1.038425 0.393654 0.392947 0.101926 0.798678 -0.319325 0.184988 0.113245 -0.743879 -0.012271 0.107006 -0.603746 -0.811144 0.59307 -0.849909 1.176953 -1.409959 -0.498854 -0.480161 -0.247033 1.435143 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.516232 -0.925561 0.103771 1.790329 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.275447 1.76683 0.574283 0.005778 4.674212 3.936726 4.513064 4.812368 4.736274,653
it feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down .,"not too badly upside down , but it is definitely different .","i had friends come home this weekend and i loved seeing them , but i also realized that college is different for all of us .",i noticed changes in my friends that did n't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there .,"i loved having friends home , knowing i had people to go out with and overall just having a blast .",but- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left .,i love college and all the new people i 've met- i just have n't had the time yet to make the kind of friends i had in high school .,"i understand this , but it 's frustrating to go from always having 10 people to call and talk to down to maybe 4 or 5. i met some people at the longhorn game on saturday and it was awesome !",i just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough i will have those close friendships with people in college .,my friends and i also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to west point .,i 've realized that i miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss .,in so many ways i wish he were here but i know that would n't be right .,"it does n't make it any easier , just a little bit more complicated .",i 'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year .,"i feel like out of 50,000 students , i am the only one staying at home with my parents .","in so many ways it 's not too bad , but when i go out with friends and they can do whatever , come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom i 'm missing out on .",a lot of it is that i am sad that i do n't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way .,it 's also hard because so many of the people i am friends with are all living on campus and so it 's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them .,anytime i have to come up to campus it 's at least 20 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place .,it just sucks because that 's really the only thing i do n't like about my college experience so far .,it always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because i do n't have that .,this is an awful long time to write .,i do n't really know what else i have floating around in my head and i still have 10 minutes .,school work is starting to kind of scare me .,it 's like oh i have a test in 3 weeks so i do n't need to worry about it now and then i know that all of a sudden 3 weeks are going to have passed and i 'm not going to be prepared .,i love not going to all of my classes everyday .,it makes it seem less difficult .,the one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that i have these huge breaks between classes .,on wednesdays and mondays i have 3 hours between classes and 1 .,5 between 2 others .,the worst part is that i do n't know what to do with the time and i ca n't go to my dorm because i do n't have one .,i 'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment is n't to explain your feelings about college because that 's what i 've done in this one so i might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time .,i 'm listening to the titanic soundtrack right now .,i 've been listening to it a lot lately .,i think it 's because it 's pretty relaxing and it calms me down .,the music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie .,i went to see titanic twice .,the first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie .,"it totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well , you can just imagine .",5 more minutes .,i 'm really glad that i did n't have to work today .,i feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday .,i work up at the recreation center on campus and i love it .,the people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age .,"this summer when i worked there , there was no one under the age of 21 except for me .",it made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that i had no idea about and wo n't for at least another 3 years .,one of my friends from high school works there and i like having her there .,"i hate the fact that we do n't work together , but hey that 's the way life goes .",i wish i had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus .,two more minutes .,i never realized how long 20 minutes could be .,"i 've found email to be quite handy with friends because i can email my side of a conversation in about 5 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter , putting it into the mail and sending it .",i have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because i have to go all the way to the post office .,whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job .,well looks like my time here is done .,i guess i have one more to do but not until tomorrow ., , , , , ,

"i am here , miles and miles away from where i started .",things are progressing slowly but i can see what i want now .,yes for a moment it seems oh so clear and then it fades .,it does not matter what i do with my life only that i am alive .,anything besides being alive is what the time was like before i was born nothing .,i do not fear this nothing however i just know it will be at the end of all my experiences .,so i better make these experiences count .,there is no resting no relaxing when there are times to be had .,i again get distracted though .,this body i inhabit continually calls upon me to fulfill its need .,if it is not this it is that .,but it is the only place my mind has to stay .,sure it is a great tool beautiful in a way but i feel the drive to leave it behind .,"i spend many passages of time trying to discover what feeds the burning inside of me , what will motivate me to take a task to a great level .",i want to design i want to build i want to create .,a need is present to put something not just something but something carefully crafted out there for others to take in and make it part of their entities .,i alone have fed off what others before me have so delicately created and taken it in through my eyes and ears and other senses .,all those creations have helped craft the person that i am .,so i know it is time to project all this back outwards with a spin that is all my own .,and when i do this i must not think about it i must subconsciously perform using the feeling that lay inside me .,i have found a companion .,we have discovered that when we combine our idea our thought our joy our pain it becomes a thing of greater nature .,"we are translating our combined impulses into a media , a media that will allow this combination of raw human toil to be available for others if they so choose to spend the time taking it in and seeing if it is a part of them as well .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.86057 -2.165749 0.091415 -2.418575 -1.356594 -0.618022 0.533103 -0.807386 0.144247 -1.101644 -0.122383 -0.590446 0.817235 0.577223 0.279829 0.0 -0.04277 0.759178 -0.576899 2.589105 0.088552 -0.742368 -0.9382 2.213005 0.328978 0.626473 0.343171 -0.99949 -1.084936 -0.357286 -0.476851 -1.430891 -1.173669 -0.168601 -1.017959 -0.443328 1.174703 -1.085099 1.18975 0.822217 -0.030554 -1.237821 0.53841 0.189632 0.279645 -0.602451 1.071791 -0.97725 -1.43643 -0.316993 -0.454341 0.141455 -0.479812 0.663936 0.556334 0.811805 -1.645791 0.172735 0.219381 0.478094 -0.395905 1.073578 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.272594 -0.98087 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.674882 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.506018 4.235144 3.566653 4.350983 5.047138 5.198594,1466
wow this is actually a cool writing assignment .,i would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what i am thinking for a 20 minute period .,i have just gotten back from a meeting about the texas lonestars organization and loved it !,the only problem is that i am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing .,i am kind of stressed out ( but not nearly as bad as i know i can get sometimes ) just because i am pre med and i know that i really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved .,"getting involved , however has never been a problem for me .",i love to be involved in everything .,now that is a problem because if i spread myself too thin i am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue .,i know for sure that i want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions .,i am going to try out for the roustabouts and the steel dance company .,i am beginning to get nervous just because i have n't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since i 've been away from home .,i hope that i am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience .,"i know that i am here to get an education , but it 's obvious to everyone that college does n't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career , but it 's also a learning experience for life lessons .",i feel that just in the week and a half that i have been here i have already become more responsible and determined .,"it has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new , huge city , but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of `` yey school is over '' to `` wow , my life is just beginning , along with lots of studying",that i do n't really want to do. `` my life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway .,i know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has .,the fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like i do n't belong .,"yet , the funny thing is that i do n't really care or maybe it 's that i do n't know how to make the effort to fit in again .",my first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that i 've lived in for the past four years ( even though i lived there when i was younger ) and i feel like it will just be weird to see how my family,'s lives have just king of carried on without me .,i wo n't really understand my mom 's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school .,my dad is perhaps the only one that i will probably still feel just about the same with because i am use to not seeing him all the time .,"my time is almost up and as of right now i am just really hoping that , even though i may not be showing my priority to god right now , he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.943655 -1.528259 -0.536784 -1.527905 -1.752271 0.957112 0.808245 1.095372 0.949812 -0.185274 0.042186 -0.590446 -0.082698 0.700096 1.073924 0.0 -0.04277 -0.858222 0.04414 -0.795527 -0.167658 0.514464 -1.143261 0.363079 -0.624052 0.306002 0.525871 -0.087077 -0.331426 0.792556 1.187166 1.175511 -1.32961 -0.00407 -1.017959 -1.109326 -0.574216 0.497224 0.236374 -0.896287 0.194384 1.440656 -0.207481 -0.683002 -0.384274 -1.255159 0.8928 -0.987219 -0.885271 -1.019498 -1.074037 -0.135884 -0.113778 0.105978 1.05986 -0.363737 -0.66207 -0.265035 0.814354 0.812461 -0.05141 0.362019 0.007534 1.029972 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.150375 -0.582382 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.168945 -0.337085 1.090014 -0.32353 1.524696 0.175065 -1.076243 4.867466 3.945126 4.562198 4.969436 4.428089,2357

at jester west .,man .,i still have 3 more classes tomorrow but good thing that i do n't have any classes on friday !,yay !,i think i am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be

well i am beginning this assignment and already i 'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing .,"sometimes i wonder why i care about that stuff but i really do n't know , and my mind just wonders endlessly all the time , which i why i think i will enjoy this assignment , once it has been evaluated , because i seem to conjure up the","wildest ideas , and thoughts and feelings when i begin to let my mind roam free .","now i 'm thinking why am i thinking about my thinking which seems really weird , but i guess thats the idea of this experiment , and i am constantly trying to think about what to think about next , so that i 'll have something to type , instead","of leaving a blank screen which would be bad , because then i would get a bad grade , even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion , not on content , which is a good thing because if it was based on content ,","and i had no content , then there would be nothing to grade , and i would have bad grades , and now it just occured to me that i am rambling on about nothing , and making fallacious points as i type , just for the simple reason to","keep typing , which is the main goal of this experiment , and i just heard my roomate coughing in the living room , he is foreign , and sometimes hard to understand , but i think it 's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because","it adds a bit of variety to the mix , and he said that his parents live in yugoslavia , and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in pennsylvania , but had to move here to austin for job reasons , which is why he lives","here , and which is why he goes to austin community college , and i know this because i asked him , and i asked him because i was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country .","he says he likes it here in the states as most foreginers refer to us as , but he , like most teenagers , misses his friends back home , which is why he goes back there every summer to visit , and i guess since he has lived both","places , and experienced both cultures and economies , is why he chose to major in international business , and my other roomate , troy , is a business major at ut , and i am somewhat of a business major , with my major being sports management , which","is in the college of education because it is a branch of kiniesiology , which i do n't know if i spelled right , but i supposed i should learn how , but anyways my major is more of a business major , like troy and djordje , which is","pronounced george , so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times , then i have another roomate named john , whom i have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me , and my mom told his mom that she","doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people , but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to nebraska with him , and his sister lynnsie , we stayed friends , and then his dad who lived in houston at the time ,","moved to san antonio when i was in 7th grade , yet we still remained best friends , though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year .","i figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together , and such good friends throughout the years , and i hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology .","now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but i guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness , rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors .","but anyways , as i was saying there are 3 business majors , then john is a chemical engineer also studying at ut , and he , along with me and troy , who is 22 , are all freshman , and djordje is a sophomore .","i sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old freshman , and to be starting your real life off that late , ever since troy and i have met .","he seems like a very interesting person to me , and i figure i will get to know him better as the year progresses , even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time , rather than socialize together , but i guess its","just nervousness of being alone , and without parents for the first time , and we will soon grow out of it .","speaking of parents , i hate to admit it , but i truly do miss my parents , and especially my dog , a dauschand , bevo , very much .","before i was to leave to move in to my apartment i could n't wait to get out of there , and to get out on my own , figuring to be free of them for good , except for the occassional visits , and i would read the college","things about how to expect home sickness , and i was thinking yeah right , not me , but just a few days after they had left , i already missed them , and i ca n't wait to see them again .","pretty sad on my part i guess on trying to be independent , but oh well , i just want to see my dog again , whom my life would be incomplete without , and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life i","was afraid of dogs , and now i see the clock and i 'm running of out of time , and it said my 20 minutes are up , so thats all i have to say .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

hmm .,writing assignment in psychology class .,"and here i was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing , excluding any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes .","man i am making so many mistakes as i type , i could n't possibly be nervous i know that for sure .","oh look , what do you know , only about 1 minute and 30 seconds have gone by ; i really do n't know if i can keep this up for another 18 minutes or so .","i wonder if grammar actually counts , not like i would receive any points on it if i wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway .",hmm .,think i will go back and read this message before i continue any longer .,"but , i guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner .","stream of consciousness , that term reminds me of my humanities class in 9th and 10th grade .","it definitely reminds of james joyce , the author of ulysses who attempted to write an entire book based on the method of stream of consciousness .","man that was quite painful to read , since he did n't use any sort of punctuations at all .",maybe i 'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either .,i wonder if i 'm destroying the purpose of this experiment .,"writing this makes me wonder , can this really be stream of consciousness ?",there had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another .,i 'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well .,"heck , whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class .","dr. pennebaker is one hilarious person , good at making fun of people .",there is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates .,it is always a good laugh .,"well , friday 's almost here , that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by .","at least i get to go home for this weekend , i 'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting american food at the jester buffet or city limits .",i 'm actually going home for business training .,"since i am an independent business owner , i should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that i have .","speaking of assets , i just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability .","robert kiyosaki is a very , very intelligent man .",i guess why he 's the multi-millioinaire and i 'm not .,"oh well , maybe i 'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend .","weird , what was i thinking .",i could 've sworn i was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier .,i guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh .,"man , it seems like it 's been forever , but only 10 minutes has gone by .","speaking of time , it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time .",some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock .,"personally , i think the clock goes by so much quicker if i 'm not constantly staring at it all the time .","i wonder how many spelling mistakes i 've failed to correct in this writing assignment , oh well .","back to the business training , i hope the ninety dollars were well spent .","i really hope that bww has put together somethin good this year , something that all the bww'quixtar-affiliated independent business owner can benefit from .","man that was a pain to type , i probably should 've just typed bww'quixtar ibo 's for that matter .","anyways , most of my friends do n't seem to believe in the business that i 'm participating in , well actually , owning .","i do n't really get any respect from them at all , and sometimes i really wonder why that is .","the only thing i 'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly , expand it large enough so i 'll have multi-million dollar returns .",and then i think i 'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity i was involved in .,"even better , the stupid electrical engineers that i call friends can work for me in the future .","just as robert kiyosaki says , an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them .",i will be able to prove myself one day .,being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life .,"besides daisy of course , she is the love of my life .","without her , i do n't think i would 've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life .","i 'm really hoping to get married to her one day , and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that i possibly can .",looks like i better get rich quick .,"but , i doubt she 's interested in me being rich , i truly believe that she 's with me today because it was her choice .","she 's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships , which is something i really respect .","she always gives her all , always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life .","i 'm so lucky that i 've found her , and i 'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life .","i can not really express my love for her in words , nor in sentences , maybe not even an essay of this length .","all i can pray for is that someday , she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart .",i thank god everyday for all the things he has bestowed upon me .,"of course , besides eternal life , daisy is the next greatest gift that i have ever received .","oh

"it may be tough to come up with an abundance of ideas this morning , because i am fairly tired due to lack of sleep .","even though my first class today is not until two o'clock , i woke up early , not a brilliant decision on my part , and i am regretting it as we speak .","however , i assume that i will feel alright once i venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed austin for the past several months .","i hope the twenty minutes that i am required to write for pass by in a hurry , because i have yet to finish some of my economics homework that is due in class today .",i have yet to discern whether my economics professor is adequate in his teachings .,"on several occasions , he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics .","on the other hand , my calculus ii teacher is not my favorite , because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor english .",i am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures .,"aside from these two exceptions , my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to .","i am tired of talking about school , because it seems like that is the only thing i came to austin for .",on many occasions so far i have gone out on nights that i would n't normally party on and have had a blast on good old sixth street .,"i think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the university of texas as their college of choice , because it has given me people to hang out with until i am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group",of friends .,"i have yet to pick out a girl worth going after , even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women , because i have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at vanderbilt","university in nashville , tennessee , much to my dismay .","i frequently talk to her via email and telephone , but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment .","however , i find it hard to stop thinking about her , because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman .","she is blonde , just shorter than me , has a perfect figure , is very athletic , intelligent , and her father has a lot of money , which is always a plus .",the only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times .,"in fact , yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in chemistry lab , thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room .","to make a long story short , the chemical turned her skin purple and it does n't wash off for at least two weeks .","i am currently living at university towers with three roommates from my high school , one of which is a pain in the ass .",he has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he does n't approve of .,it has become a nuisance .,"anyway , as my nineteenth minute comes to a close i must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.35057 -0.699575 -0.560924 -0.21821 -1.494533 0.049665 2.04603 2.363087 2.659933 -0.226927 0.034706 -0.590446 1.066636 0.656665 2.155423 0.0 -0.04277 -1.329641 -1.693795 0.52141 -1.646674 -0.742368 0.943969 0.122304 -0.030744 1.576661 3.072234 0.725447 -1.238346 -0.591388 -1.100231 -0.67282 -1.14192 -0.446943 -1.017959 -0.694709 -1.156208 0.823025 -0.702424 -1.844204 0.844184 -1.690184 0.636247 -0.273065 -1.074852 -0.079349 0.928501 0.66286 0.555011 0.518464 0.042304 -0.196603 -0.985563 -0.5645 -0.2955 2.289644 2.637899 1.852164 -0.303422 -0.173425 -1.21901 -0.601424 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.097489 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.070892 1.024188 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.281842 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.972134 4.536208 3.519689 4.624092 4.766244 5.016455,1324

i am writing this for psychology class .,"i 'm glad it accounts for part of our grade because i am nervous about the difficulty of the class , and i know this is a completion grade .","i really really want an a , but i read the professors pick-a-prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be .","there is so much reading , i do not know how i can keep up with it .","there is a good song playing on my computer right now , calling you '' by blue october .","the class dj should play it in our class , even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology , but it does not seem like much of his music does .","yesterday in class , when he walked up there to put on his music , i made a comment like 'oh no , here we go again ' , and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me .",i felt kind of bad .,i do n't know what psychological value can be obtained from this .,i find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this .,"now an incubus song is playing , its a slower , relaxing type song called `` echo '' .",everytime i hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me .,and for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball .,"i have no idea why , the song has nothing to do with volleyball .","that seems to happen a lot , when i read'hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly , for no apparent reason .","there was this book i read by dean koontz , i ca n't remember the title ( i read a lot ) , and everytime i read it , for some reason i would play the staind cd in my head .","i think its probably because the book is sort of dark'gloomy , and all of staind 's songs are depressing and miserable .",i do n't know why i like them .,"so every time i hear a staind song now , it reminds me of that book .",i always picture the book cover .,"i remember it was a really weird book , about these creatures called from some abyss of hell by some voodoo guy , in all sorts of shapes and sizes , and they hunt this guy and his family no matter where they go .",they always get in to the buildings through the ventilation system .,i can still picture them hissing and scratching at his kids .,dean koontz is a pretty good writer like that .,he is good at making the strangest things real enough to you that you can picture them .,the only thing i do n't like about his books is that they are so predictable .,"this is how they always go : there is always a strong , independent main character , either strongly in love with their spouse or single .","the main character also either encounters or owns a playful , intelligent dog .","i think dean koontz really likes dogs , usually labs .","the main character then comes upon some problem tat he'she ca n't really help but to fight , because its affecting them in some way .","for example , one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him , one lady had a psychologist ( haha ) using hypnotism to control her and several other people , giving them bizarre fears ( hers was of herself , one guy had a look-alike twin of his out",to kill him .,just weird stuff .,"so on the way of fixing the problem , the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey , or they fall even more in love with their present spouse .",and it always ends happy .,therefore i no longer read dean koontz books .,i know what is going to happen after i have read the first chapter .,now a song called `` i stay away '' by alice in chains is playing .,the guy across the hall in my dorm downloaded it for me because he said my taste in music needed improving .,it is good .,"lets see , 3 minutes to go .",dr. pennebaker keeps mentioning in class that we freshman should be feeling depressed'confused at this point in our lives .,it seems like he is trying to make business for the mental health people that he mentioned .,i personally am not overwhelmed at all by this college thing .,"it seems just like high school , for me at least .",i was always pretty independent .,did n't rely'see my parents much .,and you do n't really notice the big classes .,i still go to bed'wake up at pretty much the same time .,"we do have a

why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty and unimportant things ?,it seems as though when we leave the mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all the more important .,when my roommate and i went shopping at the galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present .,girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money onto daddy 's credit cards .,have many teens forgotten about the value and importance of money ?,i also this weekend began to wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and homophobic .,my new friend kenny happens to be fixated on getting dates'girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes him .,the entire time at the mall kenny asked my roommate and i if random people were hotter than he was .,this relentless insecurity and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining .,why ca n't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy at that ?,society 's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and relationships .,most people seek relationships on all levels with people who share the same interests and personality traits that support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that they themselves may not think on their own .,why is love and relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen 's life .,i myself have realized recently that i 've spent a great many years in relationships loving someone and being loved in return .,"we as a society place so much emphasis on dating , relationships , and marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at such goals .",i mean look at the fixation that many college age individuals have on dating shows .,in high school many an ap calculus class were spent discussing elimidate and the trashy or sexy guys'girls that were on the particular episode .,"i myself admit to watching the trash , but for some reason society has aimed my eye to these sort of shows .",since i arrived on campus dorm life has truly agreed with me .,i worried for months that my roomate would be just dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common .,"fortunately , my roommate and i have a great deal in common and are turning out to be great friends .",the university has also provided me with many unexpected opportunities .,"besides the rec center , i 'm signing up for rock climbing , the music school has turned out to be unexpectedly positive .",i have played the violin since i was 8 years old .,in the past year i have realinzed that i genuinely desired to teach music in elementary school .,when i arrived at ut on the first day of school i was terrified of auditioning for the ut symphony orchestra .,when i arrived outside of professor noe 's office i was greeted by many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me .,my nerves seemed to overwhelm me as i walked in the room .,all i could think about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me .,i felt that the audition went well but i was forced to wait the entire weekend for the results .,as it turned out my audition had gone as well as i had felt .,i was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st violin section .,i ca n't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting people .,"alas , i have to go to work and spend my entire weekend hosting , babysitting , and waiting tables .",hopefully everyone will come home from college on friday so we can catch up on all the new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other 's company ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

he was in a long distance relationship .",but he went to a & m .,"also , his girlfriend was still in high school , and my boyfriend is the same age as me .","but he was miserable , i remember how sad he was .",he used to come home every weekend .,"but he was in college station , only about an hour from home .","anyways , i would n't even want to be like that .",i do n't want to seem like i ca n't handle things and i have to run back to justin all the time .,"but i really miss him and i have this lost feeling , like i 'm not sure what to do with myself .",my roommate went downstairs to get her laundry .,she had a little package slip in the mail too .,"justin said that i should check my mail today and i did , but i did n't get anything , so i do n't know what he 's talking about .",it 's a very cloudy day today .,i am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where i have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars .,so i hope it clears off later .,the other problem is i ca n't find a place from where i can do it .,"at first i thought i would just go to the top of the jester parking garage , so i did that last night , but it was n't tall enough - i could n't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff .",so i 'm not sure exactly what i 'm going to do about it .,"it is actually stressing me out , because i just do n't know what to do .",i hope i will figure out something this weekend .,the homework is not due until thursday .,but i 'd rather get it over with .,my roommate just came back and said that i did have a letter from justin .,that is weird because i checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me .,so i 'm excited now .,now she is folding her laundry .,i did my laundry yesterday .,"it is so expensive , 75 cents a load .",that is why i 'm going to take my laundry home next weekend ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.177925 -0.802322 0.297553 -0.791487 -1.08148 0.504038 0.01662 0.157995 -0.07715 0.799255 -0.143359 -0.590446 -0.788296 0.448401 0.922202 0.0 -0.04277 0.166815 -0.101548 -0.247872 -0.173891 -0.742368 0.73579 -0.091394 -0.212835 -0.239323 -0.072696 0.288014 -1.069183 -0.78704 -1.100231 0.145348 -0.681908 -0.269652 -0.801624 0.902246 -0.114052 0.544763 -0.573531 0.554723 -0.603716 -0.292922 -0.192756 -0.052942 0.045431 -0.122767 0.307936 -0.116295 -0.50202 0.148852 -0.769245 1.290185 1.654968 -0.797323 0.57167 0.036095 -0.061138 0.504577 0.053441 0.228432 0.891517 -0.677204 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.235396 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.086289 -0.040071 0.260921 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.155161 -0.422267 -0.040405 -0.451544 -0.202809 -0.225094 4.751689 3.935172 4.830824 5.094569 4.352025,1681

my mind has been racing in circles about what to do about my boyfriend .,he 's coming out here next semester from california .,it 's going to make everything a lot harder .,my parents said that they would stop supporting me when i move in with him .,i will have to go to work full time as well as being a full time student .,i am willing to work really hard to be with lamon but i just ca n't see that this would be the best thing for my future .,or maybe it is .,who really knows .,it 's hard for me to live without him and i do n't want money ( or lack of ) to ever get in the way of love in my life .,that would feel really wrong .,i can do it .,ok this is what i believe .,"i need to take a chance on love , no matter what my parents or anyone says .",the responsibility is all left on me though .,my interpersonal communications class is really teaching me a lot about our relationship .,i love that class .,it really intrigues me .,this is such a weird stage in my life .,i have no idea what comes next .,so much change is all happening at once and i do n't know where it will all lead to .,my life could take so many different paths and it should be interesting to see what happens .,i miss my family so much .,especially my little sister .,i have this strange fear of loosing my sister .,she is so important to me .,but this is normal .,so why should i even be thinking about loosing her ?,i think it stems from the fact that my dad lost his sister ( also his only sibling ) at the age of 21. he has n't really discussed it with me but i think that the experience of loosing marsha had such a profound effect on his life .,he has always had depression problems but i have never known why .,but i have always thought of my dad of not liking his life .,and maybe i am afraid of falling into those same things i think of his life .,"when i think about it realistically , i do n't see any particular reason that i would loose vannie but that 's just it .",my father did n't see it coming either .,marsh was alone in the house and she started a fire with an iron and she burnt in the fire .,so i guess that 's what i 'm afraid of ; that without any warning or sign or anythingshe could just be gone .,i love you vanessa !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,1.592548 -0.834681 0.171819 -0.783359 -0.136549 0.091937 -0.02033 -0.207057 -0.280082 -0.866871 -0.19421 -0.202711 0.596578 -0.19531 -0.624676 0.0 -0.04277 0.840323 0.20946 -0.43166 0.104754 -0.388866 0.804004 0.483695 0.195597 -0.582937 0.145914 -0.632878 -0.246352 -0.682443 1.580447 -0.907258 0.40341 0.996635 -1.017959 1.181829 0.876559 -0.43475 1.353985 0.544236 0.695421 0.276482 0.547225 -0.451628 0.530428 -0.329729 -0.627928 0.349213 -0.506474 0.451159 -1.34699 -0.809001 -0.552643 0.102351 0.563976 -1.6535 -0.890409 -0.954251 0.122819 1.040635 0.051969 -0.220426 -0.480161 1.751261 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.380433 -1.144574 -0.073676 1.033927 -0.187076 -0.086407 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.045939 2.327683 0.41229 -0.258591 4.997261 4.011133 4.794238 4.997568 5.265568,1088

okay so i 'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and i see trees and squirrels and birds .,i really like my dorm because when i walk outside to go to class .,i always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe i should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute .,i 'm trying to think what i 've done today because i feel like i 'm wasting the day away .,i woke up at about 12:30 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed .,we all went to subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 30 minutes .,i came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves .,her boyfriend broke up with her 2 days ago and she definitely is n't being the sweetest person .,"she is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me , she freaks out .",i think she is jealous .,but what is there to be jealous of ?,it 's not like i have a wonderful boyfriend .,my ex boyfriend .,travis .,he goes to utsa because he did n't get into ut .,he will be here in a year .,well .,he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk .,i feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems .,hmmm .,well basically he ( travis ) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him .,we were together for almost 2 years .,well i told him we might be able to get back together but really i have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to ut and by then hopefully i will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him .,i love him still and it frustrates me .,college frustrates me right now .,i always had a lot of work in high school so i am used to the work load but i am just boggled down with things to do .,like laundry .,and sorority crap that is pointless .,we had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and i skipped out on it .,i feel guilty '' but then i do n't .,i did n't see the point in spending the night at the chi-o house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 51 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at scottish rite .,i do n't think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever .,oh well .,what can i do ?,nothing .,i miss my friends .,hmmmmm .,i never thought i would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so i could escape from all the petty college stuff .,like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking ( seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting `` wasted '' .,it 's like the girls in my dorm ( which is an all girls dorm ) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they 've experienced `` frat parties '' they ca n't get enough .,do n't get me wrong .,i love partying and the occasional wild nights but then i also believe that frat parties get old .,on a different topic .,i have a bunch of homework to do .,at least i 'm getting this done and i 'm enjoying it at the moment .,it 's very relaxing .,typing whatever i want .,not having a strict curriculum to follow .,i wish i could meet some guys that are n't just interested in sex .,that grosses me out .,look .,my thoughts are running rampant .,but then i also miss things with travis .,but then i do n't miss travis because i 'm in austin .,doing whatever i want .,"in the heart of the city , but then i stayed home last night .",a saturday night and i was in bed .,i guess i 'm some sort of loser .,i almost feel like if i do n't party every single night i am like the biggest loser ut has ever seen .,i need to separate myself from all this greek b. s. hmmm .,you know what else i need to do .,laundry .,read pyschology .,calculus homework .,that 's another thing that worries me .,the difficulty of my calculus class .,i have already found a tutor and i 'm having mass problems with the homework .,oh well .,i 'll get through it somehow right ?,i have tutoring tonight at 6. is n't this little story of my life so interesting .,i need like 4 boyfriends at one time like my friend kim or like 20 activities to do at one time like my friend geoff .,no i really do n't need to deal with that stuff actually .,i have problems enough worrying about what i should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my calculus homework will take me ( probably 3 hours ) .,wonderful .,so much to look forward to .,so little time .,i need to relax .,i need a back massage .,i need my mom 's cooking and my own bathroom .,i wo n't be getting those things for a long looong time .,i have no plans on going home .,if i go home my curfew will be midnight .,funny how the parties in austin do n't actually start till midnight .,oh another thing .,i hope i make good grades to make my mom happy .,she seriously is worried about me and my grades .,she probably thinks i 'm partying so much which is not the case at all .,i think i actually am in my dorm too much .,wait .,she is going to get mad because i went shopping and used her credit card .,oh lord .,i 'll be getting a call in a couple weeks .,`` lindsey .,what is this arden b store on my credit card bill ?,and why did you spend [ ] amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways ?,'' oh no .,well i have been doing this for 19 min and 11 seconds and it went by pretty fast .,and i 'm sure whoever reads this will be like `` what is this girl talking about ?,'' but that 's okay because i 'm sure there 's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment # 1 's .,well my 20 min are up and i am closing this lovely `` stream of consciousness '' with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch .,you will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her .,she was made to be wooed and won by youth ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

yeah so i am so stressed right now and i am wishing that i would n't have eaten that popcorn because eating is n't exactly that best reaction to stress .,i could get fat !,i do n't want to be fat .,i mean i know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school !,right ?,but i am trying to run a lot !,"that way , i can burn stress and burn calories .",extra calories !,i am having a hard time not getting irritated when i eat a lot .,that 's weird huh !,that it 's when i am hungry that i 'm not most irritable .,"hmmmm well today when i went running , i realized that i should have stretched because it 's going to be hard to continue running everyday when i 'm tight .",and get this !,i 've lost 5 lbs since i got to school .,but how ?,i 've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running !,oh well .,still i was kind of excited !,but i am mad that i have n't started my period yet .,my mood swings are terrible and so are again .,my eating patterns !,and that 's when i find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something i do n't like .,spanish !,ugh !,i want to move to spain and learn it by living with people who speak it !,but i really do n't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows english so she is slow to interpret and yet teach .,does she really think that if she say 's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh i 've heard that word before .,and oh i know what it means !,poof !,i mean we have to learn something before we can know it .,did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her mother 's womb .,no !,she was pottied trained .,right !,well my high school spanish teacher was horrible and i had the worst experience with that .,"while i got a great grade , i did n't learn that much which was really disappointing !",i mean i am glad i got an a but she did n't prepare me for ut where my prof speaks in spanish all the time .,not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it !,would i say to a baby .,ok this is how you open your mouth .,open it open it .,do you know what i am saying ?,it kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who ca n't speak english well .,"they are n't trying to be mean but they may say `` hey how are you '' really loudly and you 're like `` dude , they are n't deaf !",they just do n't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone '' right ?,grr .,so i feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like `` man this girl is so negative !,"'' golly , i am right now because i see my spanish prof everyday !",like i said before .,so yeah !,"uhhhhh well i am excited about this weekend but at the same time i keep thinking of how behind i am compared to everyone else here at ut , intellectually and academically !",i mean i feel so insignificant some times .,however i know where i get my wisdom from and that is jesus christ who makes my knowing god possible !,he saved me from the depths of hell !,and even after doubting him so much and having to research jesus ' life and creation and all that .,i have found that he is the one .,he is my sufficiency !,"i mean who knows more than the god of the universe , the creator of the heavens and i am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly mentally , emotionally , spiritually , and intellectually !",i mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the god that came to live like us at a point in time ( point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years ) there is just so much opposition to,him right now .,i mean there always has been obviously ( that 's why he was put to death .,well actually god let him die as a sacrifice for us !,) but i just want everyone else to know his love and i really do n't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a `` bible beating '' manner but just to love them through how i treat them .,hopefully .,i was n't too negative for .,you know what i 'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this .,please look for jesus with the pre_suppositions that he does n't exist .,expect to find him and i know you will !,to his glory alone !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

going out and having fun .",i feel like i should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute .,"but back to my parents , i feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me , because i am the last kid to leave home .",my mom has been crying constantly and i know that she is lonely because she does n't have me bumming around the house and eating her food .,sometimes i even feel sad because i now realize all the things my parents have done for me .,even though i thought they were always against me .,"when i think about the things they have sacrificed for me , i get teary .",especially when i think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before i left for austin .,"i got an acura integra , nothing i had ever expected .",i was so ecstatic and i had never gotten such a great present in my whole life .,i know that my dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than i had expected .,and now i 'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that i had taken for granted .,i really miss my parents and sometimes i have trouble dealing with it .,it 's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own .,my values are seriously getting tested because i do n't have them to give me advice anymore .,all i keep thinking is how much i love them and how i can possibly show my gratitude for them .,college is a tough thing .,"even though i went to an enormous high school , it ca n't compare to college .","my classes are huge , and sometimes very monotonous and boring .","surprisingly , the class i had thought was going to be tough and boring , became one of my favorites , economy .","mainly because my professor , hamermesh , is a great teacher .",he is lively and so humorous .,"the other classes , i really do n't care for much .",one thing i do hate about college life is the roommates .,"i live off campus on enfield , in a really nice apartment'condo .",my dad bought it with the intention that i have a nice place to live .,"it is two stories , and i have been trying to decorate it the best that i can .",but the problem is that i have to have roommates .,"one is this white girl , karmin , who i never met .","my dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in austin , looking for a roommate and she applied .","the other is a chinese girl , laura , i have known since i was a child .","i share a room with laura , so karmin has her own room , and she pays a little more .","however , i still end up paying more because it 's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways .","so karmin pays 350 for her own room , which i consider a good deal .","laura is really messy , which bothers the heck out of me .","but lately , i have been dealing with it pretty well .",karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind .,she is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household .,"but she is messy , especially in public areas and i am the one who has to clean up after her .",and the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy .,"she has a big tv in her own room , and vcr and then on the other hand , comes and watches tv that laura and i own .",so we are not allowed to use it .,"i borrowed her vcr the other day , and she asked me , `` when are you going to buy your own vcr ?","'' still , she is n't willing to share but does n't mind using our things .",same with the food .,"i really feel the need to tell her off , because she sure is getting a good deal living over here , and she ca n't have the right to treat this place as her own , she needs to respect us .","not only that , she hammered nails all up in her room , knowing that she is only living her for a year and it 's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next .","that 's my biggest problem and whenever i talk about it , i feel really agitated and stressed .","well , all i feel now is relief though , because my 20 minutes are up !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i just woke up and i 'm a little confused as i try to figure out what subject i should be studying and which assignments i should be working on .,this is all new to me .,"high school was nothing like this , never had to study .",now i really know what stress is supposed to feel like .,not that the classes are tough yet .,i guess i 'm used to being lazy .,"the food here is getting old and i 'm scared of gaining that `` freshman 15. `` tonight family is coming in , ca n't wait , a nice paid for meal .",lately i 've been feeling sad .,i parted from my 2 best friends a month ago to be here and now i can see how much i really depended on them .,my life is so different .,i have to try and fit into the friendships that were already made here this summer during provisionals .,it 's not fun .,they 're all in the sorority and i 'm sick of going out every night .,i talked to my best friends amy and christa everyday either on the phone or internet .,i do n't know what i 'd do without aim .,i miss them so much .,i 'm going home this weekend i need to see some familiar faces .,i 'm not one to be homesick i just feel i have no sort of comfort zone here even though i should .,i mean my brother lives here but has his own life with his job and girlfriend .,so i barely get to see him ever .,i 've been really sad the past 2 weeks .,it 's just been really hard .,"my boyfriend of 8 months is in the marines and lives in 29 palms , california .",he does n't get much time off with his new duties that he was promoted to so he had 96 hours off during labor day weekend and drove 1600miles to see me .,"i ca n't even believe it still , that 21hour drive had to be horrible .",that 's what keeps me going everyday .,"how much i can see by the way he 's shown me , how much he cares and loves me that he would come all the way here .",he finally bought a cell phone so we could talk easier instead of him waiting in the 2hour phone lines they have at the payphones everyday .,he 's also getting a job for his days off at a western wear store .,"he wants more money , he 's so responsible , as if being in the marines is n't hard enough work already .",its really expensive with all the gas to drive here all they time and the flights are just crazy .,i 'm going to try and fly there for his birthday .,i know my parents would absolutely kill me .,i love him so much and we 're of different religions so almost for a year now i 've had to deal with my parents .,"i ca n't stand it , its drives me crazy inside sometimes how disapproving they are of someone they wo n't even get to know .",it 's not fair to me .,they should be happy as long as he makes me happy .,i would never not be with someone because of a religion that they were born into .,"not to mention , the fact that we 're both not deeply committed to our religions or were brought up that way .",i can feel the tension and hurt coming up in the future .,when he gets out we will be very close .,"he 'll go to southwest and we 'll be together everyday , hopefully for the rest of our lives .","i do n't know , its just one more thing added on to my stress factors .",sometimes it 's just easier to cry it all out but when i let that happen sometimes it lasts for almost 24 hours straight and i make myself sick .,i 've been sick all week and i hate it .,i should be studying and i ca n't focus or keep myself to concentrate .,i have to learn .,i have to stick with it .,i 've decided i 'm not going to go out at night unless it 's a big function that i care about .,it 's not worth it .,the party scene is old .,"i 've been coming up to austin the past 4 years for the big parties , pat o 's , atlantic city , and they just do n't do anything for me anymore .","i guess that would probably be because i do n't drink and i do n't ' care to `` hook up '' with anyone so basically since those are the 2 main reasons that those fraternities have parties , they really just do n't interest me .",i 'm personally fine with going to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends and renting a sappy movie and eating a lot of junk food .,but that 's just me .,"something i do love here though is that i do n't shower to go to class , do n't get dressed up nor have i touched my make up bag since i left home .",how fun is that ?,i love it .,i just really do n't care .,"basically my plan is to try and focus on my studies , i wo n't have any boys here to distract me cause the only one i love is n't here .",i 'll do well in school and in the end we 'll be able to be together .,"he has about 1 year and 10months left , but i figure i can make it .","i mean he 's already been in there for 2yrs and 2months and i 've stood by his side the entire time , even before he joined .",he means the world to me .,i just ca n't even imagine my life without him and that 's why i plan on staying with him .,"i know people think i 'm dumb , that i 'm wasting my college years staying committed to a long distance relationship , but i do n't know why it would be dumb .",as long as i 'm happy why should i care right ?,"i do n't know , this whole college thing is really going to take some getting used to .","i mean , me , doing my own laundry ?",that 's just funny ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

been really embarrassed",i guess that 's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places .,it 's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it 's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea,what they 're doing .,"but i like not drinking , and i like feeling like i do n't have to and people accept that .",it 's really kind of nice wow i only have like 3 and a half minutes left that 's pretty cool .,but i sure am getting there .,"two dimes in the telephone alright , no it 's not easy tonight .","good song i really do love this cd i wonder if michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd , i really would love that .",or maybe if chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it i loved that .,he first played that for me outside of casey 's house .,what were we doing over there ?,were we going to a concert or something .,maybe ?,i do n't remember .,ha-ha hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey 's brothers .,they 're so hot .,but kevin 's married now .,i do n't like how i just sounded like a bimbo there i really am smart i promise .,"i feel really stupid in my world lit class though because i 've never taken latin and i have n't studied greek , and i do n't know i just feel like i 'm behind the ball here on dante 's inferno .",i like the book a lot but i 'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks .,starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far .,"so do n't make the wrong impression i do n't want raffa to think i 'm like stupid it 's like in hagood 's class though i guess i just have to learn when to speak up , it 's like i 'm wow that just interrupted me and i",had no idea where i was going .,i guess i just get writing and i have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode .,i guess that 's what i have to do when i start writing a paper because instinctively i start editing myself before i even begin and then i just end up never really getting anywhere

this is beyond weird !,i never thought that college could be so exciting and scary at the same time .,it is so weird how my thoughts have progressed through these two weeks of college .,i never thought that things would be this independent .,i am finally away from my mother and father who always told me what to do since i was a tiny little ballerina princess .,no more telling me what to do or when to get back .,and yet the weirdest thing about all this is the fact that i feel no urge to go out and party on sixth street .,"i guess all that time my parents were telling me what to do and when , was all taken into consideration when i moved up here .","in changing the subject , i just came down with a throat infection and it is the worst ever .",i told my parents that i had to get my tonsils taken out a long time ago but they never listened to me .,it is not fair .,"i had the worst night 's sleep last night and to top it all off , i have to catch up on all my class readings which means no catching up on sleep .",i am such an observer when it comes to just walking down the street or on my way to classes .,it is so funny how people i know act in a bizarre way around others compared to how they act in front of me .,"the other day i caught myself looking at a little boy no older than seven years old , and he caught my eye because he was on top of his dad 's shoulders doing the `` hook 'em horns '' sign with his tiny little fingers .",it was the cutest thing because it reminded me of when i used to get on top of my father 's shoulders and do the exact same thing .,"in a blink of an eye though , it all seems but a distant memory .",it is so weird how i always dreamed of going off away from my rio grande valley life and coming to live my life far away from all the kind of people i could not stand .,"do not get me wrong , i loved my family and `` real '' friends , but there was just something about that town and how everything ran on the game of politics .","it was all about what kind of car you drove , where your family came from , how they were connected to some of the richest people in town , and so on .",it all meant nothing to me in the end because the way i saw it was soon i was getting out of there with some place to go where people did not care about things like that .,i accomplished everything i wanted in high school .,"the highlights were getting head drum major two years in a row and winning homecoming queen and getting to conduct in my white gown in front of my band , my family , and in front of everyone in weslaco !",it was an awesome day .,the best days were when we would attempt to study for an extremely hard economics test by going over to someone 's house and actually doing no studying at all .,"those were the best because even though we saw each other in class , it was just on a 'hi ' and 'bye ' basis .","when we got together , we would get each other caught up on the latest gossip and laugh about the stupidest things all the way into the night .","somehow , we all managed to pass the test the next day and we all felt better knowing that we had connected the previous night .","talking about people in our school was the main thing because our school was made up of all kinds of want tobe 's , gangsters , stupid people who actually fooled everyone into thinking they were smart , and so on .","unless you were in band or on a varsity team , the people you hung out with were not at all your friends .",it was the best feeling knowing that so many friends were there at band practice everyday and tennis as well .,i would have to say the only thing really excellent about my old school were the faculty .,my band directors were my closest friends and still are to this day as well as my tennis coaches .,they always went above and beyond the call of duty to try and help with whatever i needed .,"now that i am gone , i guess it is time for them to help raise another bunch of good students and friends .","i feel really good leaving that small town , not knowing what to expect out here in austin .","my morals and ideas my parents , friends , and teachers taught me through the years will always remain a part of me no matter where i go !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

this is my first writing assignment .,i 'm watching cosby on tv .,i have a headache .,i 've had a headache most of today .,i woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep .,i had a stomach ache and felt like i was going to be sick .,i had a headache and did n't feel like doing anything .,so i got back in bed for a little bit .,then went over to the san jac food place for some oj .,that worked out pretty good i think for breakfast .,i think from now on on mwf i 'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus .,that class is going pretty good .,i was supposed to have a study group tonight but i called everyone and nobody could go .,so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up could n't make it .,but i do n't really need it .,i think i 'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group .,i had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the ap test so i 'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since i 'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff .,i was thinking about switching majors to psych cause i really enjoyed everything i learned in high school when i took it .,i do n't know if i 'll switch over though yet .,i 'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we 'll just see where the year goes .,all day i 've felt like crap and i miss my best friend mariko so much .,especially today since i 've felt bad .,she always makes me feel better .,it 's really tough being here at college 2 1 ' 2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks .,i 'd come home every weekend if i had my car up here but my mom did n't let me bring my car up this year .,i 'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it 's not part of the college experience .,i do n't care about the experience .,i 'm here to learn and i do that during the week .,i do all my homework when i need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends .,so why ca n't i come home and spend my time with the one person i want to spend time with .,well i know people here that have offered me rides so i can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko .,my mom was mad this past weekend cause i spent most of my time with mariko .,and my mom said she did n't bring me home just to hang out with her .,well from now on i 'll get rides home from other people so i can spend my time with who i want since my mom wo n't be wasting her time driving and getting me .,"i feel bad for thinking that , but that 's just how i feel .","i love my mom and everything , but i 'm not really close to her at all , and i 've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything .",and i am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease .,i 'm so close to mariko and i love her so much and it 's just hard being away from her .,she goes to japan every summer with her family .,i 've been thinking about going next summer .,i 'd have to talk with her parents about that though .,but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and i 'd have to stay with mariko 's family in japan otherwise i would n't be able to afford a hotel for a month .,"so that would cost me a ton of money , and then i 've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also .",i really want to go .,my mom 's really against the religion i 've joined .,she is just heard too many things that are n't true .,and i hate how she feels .,but through religion i 've learned how to deal with all these feelings and i 'm comforted now and i forgive my mom for how she feels because she just does n't know any better .,i 'm kind of tired and i still have a headache .,i want something to drink .,"the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time i checked , and right now i do n't want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out .","i do n't ' feel like a sprite either , i could go down to san jac again .",i think they 're closed though .,my shoulders have been hurting lately .,my neck really hurts too .,my neck just started today .,but my shoulders have been hurting for a while .,usually after sitting in a class after an hour .,i need to move around more or something i guess .,my hands are freezing cold .,there 's no thermostat in my room so it 's always freezing .,and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and i ca n't stand it .,i put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed .,one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and i put it up again so hopefully it all stays up .,there were already some damages to the ceiling so i guess i wo n't be charged for anything .,the sticky things that are n't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some .,but i do n't think it matters .,oh well .,i have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms .,some on the bulletin board over my bed .,i like waking up with pictures of mariko right there .,i miss her so much .,i hope she had a good day today .,last night she did n't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework .,i do n't know .,sometimes she just goes through phases .,i wish i could help her more but there 's not much i can do .,she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved .,sometimes it just gets tough for her .,and that 's a whole other reason i want to be home still .,so i can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down .,we still talk online all the time and i call sometimes .,it 's hard to find times to call though .,either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then i have classes at certain times so i ca n't just leave and call her .,but i 'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call .,tomorrow 's thursday already so i do n't think i 'll get a couple calls in this week .,i 'll call on the weekend though since i wo n't be going home this weekend .,hopefully i meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute .,i seem to be the youngest person there .,"and i 'm already not a talkative person , so i think it 's going to be kinda hard to meet people .",oh well .,10 seconds left for this thing .,hopefully the rest of the year goes well ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i 've been dating for less than a month .,"well , i 've known him for about 4 years , but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children 's camp for my church together .","it 's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that , but only because i did n't want to be mean .",he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me .,"that was always an issue for me before , but for some reason , i really do n't care anymore .",he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met .,i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago .,"me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college , we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend .","a week after we broke things off , this new guy i 'm dating told me he had feelings for me .",i was so confused and did n't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks .,but i 'm normally the uptight girl that ca n't let loose and enjoy myself .,"because of that , i decided that i 'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy .",we decided we 'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves .,my ex found out and was extremely jealous .,it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy .,"but oh well , that 's life i guess .","i am really glad i continued to see this other guy , regardless of what my ex had to say .",i spent every day with him until the day i left .,i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much .,he is amazing .,the only thing i 'm worried about is that i 'll fall too hard and too quickly for him .,i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i do n't think i 'm quite ready for another one .,that 's the only problem i 'm having right now .,the fact that he 's a high school student does not bug me as it used to .,but the distance might become an issue .,"it was an issue in a way for me and my ex , so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i 'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex .",but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me .,"but yeah , that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut .",but i am definitely loving it here in austin .,i enjoy all of my professors and classes .,"having two biology classes and a chemistry class , however , can be tough .","in addition i am taking this psychology class , which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting .","other than that i have my freshman seminar class , which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations .",i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment .,"ah , my hands are still so cold .",what do i do ?,my ears are feeling very cold too .,must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room ?,"or my bad , it is the fall now .",same thing .,today is the day for my mile run .,"ever since i moved to austin , i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym .",i absolutely love that place !,and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester .,freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape !,i find that i 've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer .,i really love this lifestyle i have at ut .,"the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming , but i do not feel like i am abusing it .","i did party a lot this weekend , but i did n't drink or anything .",people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset .,i do n't want people to view me as a party girl because i 'm not out of control or anything .,oh well .,i see that this writing is almost up .,that was n't too bad !, , , , , ,

the first thought that enters my mind is that i have no idea what i am going to say in this assignment .,i have no thoughts or feelings except that i am trying to think about what to say .,"these types of assignments are difficult for me because i usually concentrate on a concrete task , not writing down random thoughts .","because i am a guy , sex just popped into my head .","because i am male , i hope i do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes .","for the next nineteen minutes , the only feelings i will have are those of confustion and befuddlement , for lack of anything to say .","this being my first college writing assignment , i am a little nervous that i may be doing this wrong .",i must change my previous statement that i am confused .,it is more of a fear that i will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it .,my next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time i had left .,only fourteen minutes left .,yahoo .,i just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow .,"it is not that i like volleyball , but that it takes away the gym at gregory for playing basketball , which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights .",( eleven minutes left .,i ca n't wait ) .,"i just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar , spelling , and sentence structure .","this is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment , and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it .","i just saw an empty dr. pepper can in the garbage can and i thought i might like one , but then i realized that i wanted to finish this assignment before getting one .",my next thought was that i wish i had a thesaurus right now because i have used the word `` assignment '' too many times .,"excuse me , someone just knocked on the door .",it was one of my roommate 's friends who scares me because i believe he might go `` postal '' at anytime .,"i had a thought before this person came to the door , but i forgot it now .",it 's okay because i only have to write for seven more minutes .,i am wondering what my `` quote of the day '' will be on my board outside my dorm .,i want to use a quote from the movie `` what about bob '' but i 'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board .,"again , i am having the problem of not knowing what to say .",it must stem from my lack of self-esteem .,i just glanced at the clock and found that i only have to write for two more minutes .,i just realized that i should not have written that down because i could have stopped then and you would n't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences .,"if this `` assignment '' was supposed to show me how my mind works , i am not pleased with the results .",it shows me that my mind does not work that well at all ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.585706 -0.987741 0.562584 -1.405431 -2.072155 -0.783091 0.921504 0.530498 -0.182222 -0.42762 -0.124323 -0.590446 -0.238404 1.435213 2.302156 0.0 -0.04277 -0.532557 0.388391 -0.795527 0.195554 -0.182077 -1.346169 1.843199 0.025509 0.977393 0.441993 0.743724 -1.296436 -1.624919 -1.100231 -1.015919 -0.099161 2.109641 -1.017959 -0.655399 1.780013 2.012912 1.633219 -0.096287 0.335563 0.55286 -1.76917 -0.05878 0.51202 -0.261018 0.013361 -1.487619 -0.518787 -1.506962 -0.434381 0.597591 0.985643 -0.458266 2.144983 -1.001723 -0.168886 1.350122 -0.476952 0.27348 -0.361378 0.222199 -0.480161 -0.250598 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.319312 0.030222 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.0779 4.633999 -1.137 0.649706 -0.083432 -0.322413 4.054271 4.836233 4.17779 4.618113 4.308118,711
i 'm wondering just what the point of this is .,"this is really boring , i wish i had something to eat , it 's getting close to dinner time , maybe if i turn on the stereo this wo n't be so bad .","it 's really hot in my dorm room , this is still as boring as ever .",i do n't know how i 'm going to be able to keep this up for twenty minutes .,i ca n't help but stare at the posters to kill time .,i 'm particularly fond the print of monet 's sunset at venice .,"there are so many things i 'd rather be doing right now , like watching tv or sleeping .","well i 'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing , since 6 minutes has lapsed .",i wonder just how many of these the professor'ta 's actually read .,i know i would n't want to have to read any of these .,hopefully i did well on my biology test i took today .,tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool .,"i still have a lot of reading to do tonight , which i will more than likely put off until sunday .",only ten minutes has gone by so far .,"this is incredibly boring , but at least it 's not all that difficult .","i thought last class 's discussion was very interesting , however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed .",i can hear people talking out side .,"normally i would find this disruptive , but now it 's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about .","i wish i had a laptop so that i could type this elsewhere , and i think the heat from my computer contributes to my room 's excessively high temperature .","i wish i could go to the game saturday , but i did n't get a ticket .",last week 's game was really exciting .,only one more minute .,i just wish this were over with .,"i ca n't help but notice how disorganized my desk is , even this early in the school year .",i can hear music playing in the next room .,i wish my stereo system was that loud ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.180514 0.087146 -1.268853 0.270883 -0.403906 0.600289 0.335354 0.247311 0.204571 -1.15087 -0.160099 -0.590446 1.488457 -0.604475 -0.067464 0.0 -0.04277 -1.402753 0.111794 -0.795527 -0.096278 -0.742368 -1.466104 -1.374068 -0.624052 -0.240005 -0.002051 0.103835 -0.603026 -0.542477 -0.454829 0.460167 -0.269187 -0.906028 -0.498872 -1.109326 0.556664 -0.118141 -0.322884 1.405543 -1.038726 0.67275 -1.166471 0.599038 1.51973 0.404178 -1.093488 -1.542908 0.155289 -1.899073 -0.884899 0.838894 0.333041 -0.405863 1.025481 0.372251 0.845777 0.212547 -0.63218 0.393011 -0.34136 -1.600134 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.08773 0.356891 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.593332 -0.451544 0.085427 0.526987 4.550961 3.314184 4.880851 4.53696 4.525382,2174

i just had a conversation with sarah .,she can be so touchy sometimes .,it seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she ca n't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying .,"just a few minutes before hand , i was telling her about what i need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness '' writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he","was writing and in affect , she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that was n't pre-planned .",i told her that that was not `` stream-of consciousness '' because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story .,then she just got irritated and told me that i do n't do that to her .,"and i was like , `` what ?",'' .,she does n't make any sense .,oh dear .,surat is screaming her head off and i have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight .,it is 10:30 and she usually starts screaming about now .,"surat is a nice bird though , other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood .",she usually keeps herself pretty entertained .,there she goes again .,i should tell monica to cover her .,moni is probably busy with her studies .,how am i supposed to tend to my bird while i am doing this assignment ?,i have to stay here and complete it or then i would n't really be doing the assignment right .,that brings up another point .,what is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 20 minutes .,are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment ?,would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break ?,"ok , i had to go cover the cage but it did n't take more than five seconds ( literally ) because the cage is on the other side of the room that i am in .",that is a relief .,now she is n't screaming .,now what should i write about .,hmmm .,i had a yoga class today .,ashtanga yoga .,it was very difficult to do and very fun .,i hope to become really flexible this semester .,i also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester .,i got a texercise pass from gregory gym for 55 dollars and i have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes .,it is wonderful .,i just wish i did n't have this psychology class at 3:30 to 5pm because two really good classes go on at that time .,it is really disappointing .,i ca n't believe i am taking a psychology class ( 301 ) this late into my undergrad .,i am a senior and i am just taking this class because i decided just recently i want to go into counseling psychology .,and in order to do that i need 4 psychology classes with a `` b '' or higher .,i am going to make an a in this class .,this summer had a large effect on me .,i realized that i really did n't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family .,i think i just spelled that `` adequate '' word incorrectly .,i hope this assignment is n't going to be graded on spelling .,that would be ridiculous because this is a `` stream of consciousness '' paper .,what if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly .,this page does n't have a spell checker .,people are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing .,have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing ?,my sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers .,that seems so ancient now and that was only about 11 or 12 years ago .,its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years .,what is going to happen next ?,i will tell what will happen next .,we will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left .,the earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise .,i think they should study that in psychology .,why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings ?,we are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources .,we are causing a great imbalance in nature .,would they even be able to study that in psychology ?,that might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they do n't want to admit how ridiculous humans are .,"or rather , can be .",i really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology .,or at least i have more experience in those other two areas .,i tend to take the middle ground however .,i am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and i am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment .,i think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist .,am i going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology ?,i hope not .,"psychology is a good field , do n't get me wrong , but one has to remember that everything has its faults .",i took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments .,some of the questions were funny to me .,i think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica .,haha .,my 20 minutes are over .,guess you do n't get to read about my opinions on erotica ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before .,and that would be how much i miss my best friend .,i was eating at wendy 's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 5 by then .,"so i ate a jr. cheese burger , medium fries , and some orange juice .","then i went bak and got a salad , frosty , and some water .",but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a hosa meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking .,and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend rakhi at texas a & m .,i do n't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her .,i guess i 'll get bak to her later when i think of more .,my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought .,and im guessing its most probably amit because it said unknown for the caller id which most prob .,means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that .,also i am really use to pushing ctrl s and i ca n't really do that here because i am not writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 90 % of the work i have done is saved every few,minutes because i really hate having to redo work .,now i guess i was just thinking of the clock .,i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 7 minutes .,i thought because of what monique said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough .,my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 2 o ' clock today .,once again .,i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her .,and she was like awwww i love you in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan .,and now the dorm phone rang and arpan called .,i guess we do n't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm .,lol .,but ya it was really cool that she called .,and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess ' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone !,well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i do n't know much else that i am thinking about currently .,i guess maybe finding out how much a greyhound ticket to a & m costs since i would love to go there .,"well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my mis homework , chek the emails from dell , check out the sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes ,","read some eco , go over eco notes , read some philosophy , and the philosophy book , read the beginning of the psychology book , and finish chapter 1 of mis , and finish reading developing you into me of ba101 .",wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on .,so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 2 o ' clock .,i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done .,it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that .,"besides all that , sid , my roommate , also suggested a movie at 9 playing for free at the union so i may look into that .",besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i do n't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so,i thought id write it down -

the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick .,i ca n't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother .,i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back .,i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother .,he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it .,"he still thinks he can beat me , but that wo n't probably ever be true until i 'm about 60 and he 's 57. this weekend , i hope to attend the football game with my friends again .",i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot .,it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed .,a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before .,it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me .,i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games .,i might even paint my face to show some school spirit .,maybe not .,"after i finish this assignment , i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday .",i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment .,the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it .,my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited .,"i think that is cool because in high school , there was n't a writing center that would help you with your paper .",you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you do n't have a clue .,i guess that 's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that 's a great feeling to have .,the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book .,i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo 's was out of them .,"textbooks are very expensive in college , but it 's probably worth it when it comes to things you do n't understand or for the test .",the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store .,i think my time is up so that 's all i 'm going to write .,i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that 's the purpose of this essay .,"so , that 's all .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

so yesterday my boyfriend from a & m came down to austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary .,it was a lot of fun but i stayed up late so i 'm pretty tired .,i hate that feeling of no energy and i just want to sleep but i know i ca n't because i am so stressed out .,i am still really adjusting to college life .,it 's is so different from high school and its not all that it 's worked up to be .,"i really like all the freedom , along with everyone else , but i am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying .",i am only taking 14 hrs .,", which is supposedly and easy load , but i feel so bogged down .",i tell myself i am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up .,i have so much i want to do but there are not enough hours in the day .,but everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust .,i just do n't hope it will reflect in my grades .,"i thought i had a calculus test next friday , but i came to find out today that it is nest wednesday .",that is really scary .,bit i took calculus my senior year in high school so i feel i know some of the stuff .,"everyone studies hardcore for tests , which i am pretty nervous about .",i do n't really do to much homework in that class because i have so much to do in my other classes .,i really hope i 'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student does n't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that i did n't try .,"anyways , i have a problem with the nest football game which is tx vs. rice .",i did n't realize they sold the tickets so early .,i guess the draw started yesterday .,i want to go but i have n't really met a lot of close friends to go with .,this guy friend from high school wants me to go but i really want to go with a big group of people .,i have never been to a large football game .,actually the only games i have gone to have been my high school games .,"but my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school .",a lot of the seniors from our school went to a & m because it 's only an hour away .,i do n't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this .,"i am originally from california , which was so pretty , and houston is n't the prettiest place in the world .",i forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me .,it is getting really annoying .,seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now .,i like it but some people are obsessed with it .,but i guess i am obsessed with my cell phone .,i do n't even use any other phone .,i am always on it .,i think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on their cells .,i feel like i have to take mine to and call someone so of course i do .,"plus , walking to class gets kind of lonely .",i feel like these thoughts pop in my head and i then i go in a tangent to try to type .,but then my mind goes blank for a second .,i never really thought i was a good writer .,"in fact , i thought i was horrible .",my teachers never gave me feedback and i never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class .,"it was n't until the end of my senior year , my english teacher told the whole class that i was one of the best writers in the class .",i really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and i feel like i do write well .,it almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like i do everything else .,my critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester .,i believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate .,"i try not to since it 's such a bad thing , but i guess it 's just human nature .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper .,i hope you really really enjoy this one after all the other ones you have read .,anyway right now i am really excited because i 'm just about to go to the rage against the machine concert .,i 'm hoping that i have a blast and i know i will .,my brother and a lot of my friends came up for this concert .,"so , i will be able to see them .",ai n't that the greatest thing .,"earlier today , i was wishing that i could fly .",the reason for that is that we were stuck in traffic .,"just think about it , just flying through the air , your hair flying back , brushing across your face -- but i guess if we could fly , we would n't think that much about it .","yesterday , i got an e-mail from my sister .","it was really cool and all , and she should come visit me soon .",my sister is the one person in my family that i really enjoy -- but enough about that .,"i 'm going to a concert , and to party !","oh , just to throw something in here .",i was noticing that many people here get really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the morning .,"i think this is really hilarious because i come from laredo , texas .",that is a border-town to mexico ( not that it could be canada in texas ) .,"well , we have clubs and discos in mexico that are just a few minutes away so i 'm use to going out , staying out late , and drinking .","therefore , i came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have fun during their high school years -- whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves .","that is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in ut , and why a lot of students struggle just to pass .",i hope pass all my classes with a 's if possible .,"i 'm planning to be a plastic and reconstructive surgeon , and i kind of need a great gpa to get into med school .","oh by the way , i want to clear up the reason why i want to be that kind of a surgeon .",many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money .,some people do n't even consider doctors as real doctors .,they are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay young and beautiful .,"although plastic surgeons may do this , they help build up the self-esteem of the patient .","there are some people who were born with defects or were in a really bad accident , plastic'reconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again .",most people with some type of defect usually have a low self-esteem .,"therefore , they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people .",plastic'reconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world .,they feel better about themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is improved .,this is vital to the survival of the individual -- for without it there is nothing to live for .,"well , i 'm going now hope i did n't bore you too much !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.251411 -1.052569 -0.822801 -0.985992 -1.198224 0.136377 1.704547 1.28876 1.348563 -0.457913 -0.142085 -0.590446 0.335761 -0.020826 0.964741 0.0 -0.04277 -1.708413 -1.709655 0.374659 -1.702927 0.962909 -0.005984 0.028165 -0.624052 1.306842 1.115679 -0.704736 -0.063621 0.710899 0.192916 0.674098 -0.850163 -0.906028 -0.671273 -0.648808 -0.735642 0.822004 -0.135967 -0.060771 -1.038726 0.446744 -0.864823 -1.278009 0.146261 -1.542652 -0.719181 1.021874 -1.290491 0.28885 2.97369 -1.151427 -0.481796 -0.538012 0.120127 0.764227 -0.471058 -0.174974 1.448542 1.357139 1.529932 -0.860617 0.071261 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.289283 0.581117 0.105059 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.087278 3.081241 -0.422267 -0.474362 0.665695 0.911484 0.416574 4.604846 3.742389 4.67793 4.542646 4.647448,11
i do n't know what to write about really and i have a bunch of other things on my mind .,"i have n't eaten breakfast yet and i 'm pretty hungry , but i fear that if i do n't do this now i might never get around to doing it .","the assignment does n't seem to be that difficult , but sometimes i have trouble thinking of things to say .",i 'm not going to my calculus study session because i think it will mainly be review of what i have already learned in high school .,my roommates friend henry just called and somewhat interrupted my thoughts .,i do n't think my roommate likes henry very much but i do n't know that for sure .,he always calls when my roommate is n't here which to me is a signal that they 're not really in sync .,when i feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we 're in sync with each other .,i think that the more time you spend with a person the more you become somehow linked to that person .,i 've been waiting to read a book for some time now and my friend just finished and gave it to me .,i think everyone should read ai n't nobody 's business if you do : the absurdity of consensual crimes in our free country by peter mcwilliams .,"not only is it a very controversial book , but it is also humorous and very informative and educational .","peter mcwilliams has aids , cancer , and was using marijuana for medicinal purposes under california state law , but was arrested and thrown in jail .",i agree with mcwilliams 100 % about consensual crime being ridiculous and i think it 's wrong that he 's in jail now .,i got fined $ 15 recently for parking in lot a67 next to jester .,"the parking and traffic administration expects me to park on the other side of red river , or better yet i35 .","i think this is stupid and am very upset with this , i plan on writing a letter of complaint to david kapalko .",my parents finally came to their senses and bought me a computer for school .,that is one of the main reasons i am able to do this assignment now .,i did n't feel comfortable writing these kind of personal thoughts in a computer lab full of other people .,"my parents got a good computer for a low price and now i can work from my dorm room , so i think everyone is satisfied .",i just wonder if having a computer will be another hindrance to meeting new people especially girls .,"not that there are n't plenty of girls that use computers , but i do n't really get out enough as it is .",i know it 's up to me to make the effort but i almost feel trapped in a situation where i do n't meet enough girls or hang around them enough ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.50427 -0.48684 -0.385462 -0.777543 -0.925552 -0.170585 1.258182 1.467048 2.135703 -0.673752 -0.059536 -0.590446 0.807176 -1.101597 1.198517 0.0 -0.04277 -0.81147 -0.334044 -0.142923 -0.39093 0.208652 -0.787523 0.243763 0.110977 -0.260317 0.671604 -0.506344 -0.274267 -0.490539 -0.13866 -0.961317 0.153379 0.231461 0.142105 -0.595671 -0.042092 -0.943411 0.954639 -0.466426 -0.261168 -0.90547 0.277553 -0.199863 -0.550726 -0.45495 0.576495 0.0468 0.533879 -0.567959 1.06262 -0.769737 -0.714494 -0.927684 0.040101 -0.081318 -0.280352 0.784136 1.036723 0.093924 -1.642227 -0.362866 -0.480161 -0.185519 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.685462 -0.378124 0.125683 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.88147 -0.451544 0.327524 -0.451635 4.770422 3.801143 4.588848 4.537784 4.874093,455
today was a pretty good day .,i had only one class and then i had the chance to take a nap .,i was so tired .,and i am not sure why .,"i mean i know why , i am up until late on the phone every night with danny but i should be getting used to that right ?",i think that after over a year of talking on the phone that late i would be used to it .,i miss him so much .,i wish he were here with me .,it seems like everything that i do or see or hear reminds me of him .,sometimes i have a hard time concentrating in class because i am thinking about him .,that is not a good thing ; i mean i need to concentrate on my work and my studies .,sometimes i feel guilty because i feel like i miss him more than i miss my family .,is that bad ?,i mean i feel like it should n't be that way .,but i love him so much .,i constantly wonder if we will end up being together forever .,i really think this could be the one .,i am really nervous though about even telling my parents about how serious we are .,i mean they must suspect something but i know they would never guess exactly how serious we are .,i always wished i could tell my parents more than what i do but i never have felt like we have any kind of connection in that respect .,it seems like all my good friends have that and i am defiantly jealous about that .,"i mean laura , my roommate , has that with her mom .",she can tell her mom anything .,why is it that i never felt like i could talk to my mom ?,"i will never do that with my kids , i mean when i have kids i am going to keep that line of communication open .",i mean i do n't think they want me to be their best friend or anything and that does n't faze me but i would like to be able to talk to them about the daily gossip at school or the party they went to last weekend or their boy'girl,problems .,"i think that if danny and i do stay together , he would make a great father .",i mean he has the same opinions as me about raising kids and all that .,i mean that is a lot of the reason we are so good together .,we think alike and we know what the other one is thinking .,something i just thought about is our friends .,"i like his friends , and they like me .",but it seems that some of my good friends just do n't think highly of danny .,i mean it is upsetting .,"liv makes me mad because she thinks she knows what is going on and she thinks that i could do better , i constantly tell her that she could n't know .",she does n't know danny like i do and she does n't know the type of relationship that danny and i have .,jill usually is pretty positive about things with danny and i and so is laura .,matt it seems never is .,but matt is a whole other story .,i do n't talk to matt all the time anymore being that he still is back in san antonio .,one thing i ca n't stand about matt is his constant mood changes .,it is just so hard for me to deal with that sometimes .,and it seems like no matter what happens he always knows what is going on between danny and me and if he does n't he asks me and expects that i am just going to tell him .,what does he think i am stupid ?,he ca n't keep a secret and that bugs me .,"i mean if i tell a good friend of mine something that i think is personal , i would expect them not to say anything .",the problem is that i do n't always tell them not to say anything but i would hope being that they are my best friend they would be able to figure that out on their own .,i think that is not too much to ask .,just the other day matt asked what danny and i did the other night .,that is none of his business and i tell him that and he still pries .,what is his problem ?,"sometimes i wonder how matt and i have stayed friends for so long , and good friends at that .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,1.393492 -0.263589 0.938361 -0.405883 1.152089 -0.422719 -0.651393 -1.000477 -0.998456 0.360003 -0.150774 0.788997 -1.494434 1.156517 -0.927903 0.0 -0.04277 2.118866 0.793811 0.885757 1.076059 -0.742368 2.379959 0.844271 -0.624052 -0.939396 -1.496587 -0.575998 -0.140425 -0.115969 -0.790573 -0.523578 -0.200006 -0.173408 -0.270799 -0.116841 1.720061 0.254906 1.954132 1.023131 -1.038726 1.088473 1.168023 1.073564 -1.146529 2.660673 0.25099 2.346266 2.536564 1.887457 -0.238453 -0.435937 -0.762151 1.232023 -0.018902 -1.291681 0.250822 -0.954251 -0.289125 1.934357 -0.789462 -0.537621 -0.480161 -0.384728 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.240704 -0.792769 -0.073676 0.498171 0.607243 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.734045 -0.451544 -0.17166 -0.872495 5.039286 4.235274 4.659935 4.988586 4.581375,1246

.","but , the time will be spent well , and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him , or make it harder , because he 'll be fresh in my mind .","they say out of sight , out of mind , and i believe that to be very true .",same went for mike .,"but , the longer i 'm away , the less i think about john , and the less i truly miss him .",i think the same goes for him .,it does n't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when i first was here .,but of course that should be expected and it was .,i do n't like the way some things are here .,"i want to get out and meet some different kinds of people , or meet nonfrat type boys , because i 'm not liking the conservative style that much .",it 's not what i 'm used to .,i definitely do n't like how money and status are such an issue .,"it 's ridiculous , it reminds me of the movies .",i did n't think people like that really existed .,"i left california thinking i was getting away from all the selfabsorbed , selfimage , stuff , that i was really growing sick of , only to come somewhere and feel as though i 'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery , based on money , family name",", status , having not really anything to do with how good looking you are , as is the california snob , but how much money your dad makes , or what kind of car you drive , or whether or not you buy an $ 800 shirt to wear",to a frat party .,"it 's all very ridiculous to me , and it makes me sad , and homesick for a place where it 's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time , and where you 're not judged by how much money you have .","i do love how the boys always hold open doors for you , and pay for everything ; those are aspects i do very much enjoy .","i would not want to raise my kids here , i 'm not even sure now if i want to live here after college .","i love a lot of things about it , and i 'm having so much fun , meeting lots of wonderful girls , the guys are a problem for me .",i went to college thinking that it 's funny knowing this is probably the place where i 'll meet my husband .,i highly doubt it at this point in time .,"i 'd have to find a diamond in the ruff , like becca did .","it makes me miss john , karl , daniel , jordan , ryan , even so much more .","it makes me miss all my guy friends , and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite , but funny and perverted , to a certain point of course .","i ca n't wait to see john , i wonder how things will be .","i 've decided to tell him how i really feel , knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way .","i think he probably has an idea of the way i feel , i 've probably hinted at it before .","i do have a glimmer of hope , since he 's been signing his letters with the word love , and wrote , `` love , john on the picture he drew , and he is spending at least $ 300 to come out and see me , which unlike","all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make , doing countless hours of work , and now is throwing it all into a three day trip .",it really is incredible to me .,it touches me to think he would do something like that for me .,"i wonder what daniel and karl think about that , especially daniel .","what about jordan , i wonder if mike will find out .",what will he think about that ?,"he once said , regarding the necklace and earrings from daniel , that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever .","well , he knows john never ever has any money , never has a steady job , and mooches off of everyone else .",how would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me ?,maybe then he would open his eyes a little .,probably not though .,"i hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport , i know candace wo n't want to miss any of her classes , for him of course i could , it does n't look like i have any test or quizzes that thursday or friday .",i do have a psychology test the day after he leaves .,how will it be when he leaves ?,i wonder if i 'll be really depressed .,"probably , i 'm probably making it harder on myself .",probably harder on both of us

"okay , i 've begun writing .","one thing i should probably point out as i recall the above statement about disregarding grammar is that i spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as i type are second nature to me , so it 's not like i 've gone back",and fixed all the errors .,which does n't mean that there probably are n't any run on sentences in here .,okay .,that 's been said .,right now my roommate is being fairly loud .,i find that bothersome .,i 'm not sure if he 's stupid or inconsiderate .,i 'd rather be at home right now .,i was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now i 'm having trouble getting the motivation to do anything .,"it made the summer more fun at the time , but it was maybe not such a good idea .",ideas are like that because of that whole 20'20 hindsight thing .,i 'm looking at the vents on the side of my computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gills .,i 'm not looking forward to having to do the other writing assignment .,"which is not to say i think it 'll be difficult , but this assignment requires almost no discipline .","the other one will require me to have directed thought , and that 's not really that big a deal , but it 's one thing to sit down ready to do a task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long you 're supposed",to be doing it .,"what i mean to say is that the time will seem to pass more slowly because i 'll be watching the clock , so i 'll probably be more bored , and i do n't like to be bored .",i 'm not very far into this but my train of thought seems to have stopped .,"probably because my roommate ( or actually suitemate ; i have a room to myself but share a refrigerator , microwave and two bathrooms with two other guys ) keeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly .","it would n't be so bad if he 'd just shut his door , but for some reason he has n't thought of that .",they 've wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of my door now .,"now they seem to have left , so maybe i can concentrate .","no , that did n't work .","i 've found it previously difficult to make my mind blank intentionally , but now it seems to come quite easily .",i think probably i 'm tired .,"the cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at my home , so when there 's nothing else to do i usually watch something like comedy central late at night and shave a few hours off of a healthy amount of sleep .",that 's better ;

i do n't know a lot of people in every one of my classes and that makes me nervous and anxious .,i guess i also am feeling very excited too .,"i am away from home , from parents and rules , and away from people i know .",i like familiarity .,that is like a comforting thought to me .,i ca n't stand the fact that this school is so huge that i do n't even know where my next class is .,all i want to do is curl up in my dorm bed and stay there .,"even though i do n't like my bed at all because it is n't like mine at home , it will do .",i am excited about the weekend that is coming up .,"i get to go home and see my family , my boyfriend , and my friends .",i wake up every day from the day i got here to look forward to this weekend .,"i do n't know why , but i guess i am lonesome .","in addition , i did n't make the longhorn band , which was very upsetting to me .",i am very upset that i did n't make it because i knew i could have .,"it 's just that in the back of my mind , i knew that if i make longhorn band , i would n't be able to go home to visit as much i want to .","so , i really did n't give the audition my best shot because , as much as i wanted to make it , i did n't want to just as much .","no matter which way i looked at that , i guess i feel good that i did n't make it and i regret it because i wanted to make it also .",that was a conflicting feeling that was bothering me too .,another thing that scares me is that i made the decision to take chemistry even though i did rather poorly in high school .,but something in me just wanted to take it and prove to myself that i was n't dumb in chemistry .,i just am stubborn when it comes to giving up .,i ca n't stand it when i ca n't finish something or i am not good at something that i could be .,maybe that 's why i am so confused about the band thing .,"no matter what , i want to kick myself for not making it , but on the other hand , i am jumping for joy because i know i wo n't be as stressed out and have time to do stuff .",i was in band all through high school and i guess i decided to continue in college because it was a familiar thing for me .,"plus , i had such a bad experience with band directors that i was rather wary of the ones here .",but i made such great friends in band that i am afraid that i wo n't have any while i am here not in band .,"another thing that worries me is that everyone tells me that i will change and stuff and they say things like , `` oh , you 're probably going to 6th street and party all the time. `` even as a joke , i found that very insulting .",how do they know that i will change ?,"yes , it 's true that i may change , but i have rigid moral standards that were inhibited in me from the day i was born so i do n't think the changes will be that drastic or horrifying .","whenever anyone says that , i get really annoyed and frustrated .",another major thing i worry is whether i will ever get used to the fact that i am no longer living at home with the `` comfort zone '' that i was accustomed to .,"i mean , i am afraid to go home and find out that people over there changed a lot too .",it 's troublesome to me .,like chemistry .,i also worry about the fact that none of the clocks run together and classes end at varying times .,"i am so scared to walk into a class late , making the professor mad or annoyed .",that 's another fear of mine that i can see happening and i worry very much about it .,"that is why i tend to run out of classes , even though i have plenty of time .",i am the typical goody-goody that never disobeyed the parents and had many people that had high standards for .,so i hope i do n't let them down while i am here .,"no matter what , i ca n't help that i am who i am for others .",i am the oldest of three kids and my parents always told me to set a good example for my younger siblings .,"if i screw up , they will too , as i was told .",you have no idea what kind of pressure that is to me .,"i hope that i do n't

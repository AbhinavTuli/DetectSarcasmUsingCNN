"hi , my name is heather hughes .",i am 18 years old .,"i am catholic , i like to play the piano , i miss my family , i miss my friends .","i do have alot of friends that came to ut with me , but i did n't really hang out with them much in high school because i had a boyfriend and seemed to live a totally different life than they did .","they were on the debate team , i was on the dance team , i joined every organization there was in high school because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great .","all my friends here are really smart , they all graduated in the top ten percent of the class .",my cell phone is ringing now .,"i really want to pick it up , but i think it 's just my cousin so i 'll leave it alone .","it kind of gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time , instead of my room number when i told her that when she calls it costs me alot , it 's long distance .","i still have the same number from back home , so my mom can call for free .",i had a bad dream the other night about my mom .,"i dreamt that she had done something really sweet for me , and i did n't appreciate it .",all i could think about was being with my friends .,"when i came to orientation this summer , i hated it !","i called my mom every 20 minutes telling her that i would rather go to texas tech or midland college , the community college in my hometown .","but now that i 'm here , i really like it .",i do n't miss her as much as i thought i would .,i really miss my exboyfriend .,i think i disliked orientation so much because we had just broken up .,"we had gone out all through high school , and he 's at tech now .",that 's where i really wanted to go .,"i got in , and into the business school too , but i really wanted to be in the honors program .",i guess i was a little conceited and believed that i was smarter than the average student at tech .,"anyway , i had applied really early and had n't heard from them , i waited and waited .","i received my letter from ut but it did n't mean anything to me , because i did n't know anything about this college , none of my friends were going here , and kit would n't be here .",but my parents gave me a deadline and said i had to decide on a college by march 26 or something .,"so , i decided to come here .","i think mostly because i was upset that tech wasnt ' as eager to accept me into the honors college , and i also thought , tons of couples go to different colleges , and if they can make it , surely kit and i can .","well , prom rolled around about 2 to 3 weeks later , and kit made prom court .",we were both amazed .,"because he made court , he had to learn how to dance and eat properly , and wear a coat and tails tux , which really did n't look that great on him since he was a bulky football player .","so the day of prom rolls around , and kit callls about 2 to say that the court got a limo .","i thought great , now we do n't have to worry about transportation !","but then he said there would n't be enough room for the dates , just the court .","so i asked him , am i suppossed to go to prom alone ?",and he told me to have my parents drive me !,"i was so upset becuase later on i found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or not , and kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me .",i do n't know if i 'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel .,"everytime i think of my prom , i 'll always remember that .","he also said during prom , that i had been acting weird ever since i choose ut .","that made me even more upset , because he had never brought it up before , he had always said , do what 's best for you .","i did n't know that he thought what was best for me was him , and not a better education .",i miss him so much .,"i tried to get back with him this summer , and he said he wanted to too , but everytime we 'd almost get back together , he 'd say no .",that it would be too hard to have a long distance relationship .,"i 'm really disappointed in him , this summer he went and got a tatoo , knowing that i dispise them , and right before he left for tech he did n't tell me about it .","a week later , i ran into his parents at best buy and his mother told me .","each time he does something like this i vow this is the last time , i 'm through with him , but i keep going back , thinking about how good it used to be , and i fall in love with his memory all over again .",i wonder if he 's dating anyone yet ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'm not so sure how i felt about it yet .,"not that it was bad or anything , but i 'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual .",it seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues .,"mostly gender , weight , and scared issues .","but than again , i guess the experiments that i did this for will probably deal with those issues .","i really do n't know why i tried to do that survey right when i got up this morning , i just about fell asleep on the keyboard , but that 's alright , i finally got through it

close to the water .","well anyway , i really miss the ocean .","every night i try to picture the crashing waves , and feel the cool mist on an earl morning .",when i walk to class i even feel it in my feet and legs .,just on their own my legs begin to surf .,"the same muscle motions , i guess they call it muscle memory .",i can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip .,"or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left , stalling , and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube .",that 's all i live for .,or lived for .,texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while .,"no i take that back , nothing can stop my love for it , i guess texas just got in the way for a little while .",that 's where my problem comes up socially .,"i now realize that if you 're not in california , or any beach community for that matter , people just do n't understand .","i feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little

pulls you in , and wo n't let go .","it 's a way of life , not just a social activity .","it 's a culture , and it 's become who i am .",not just surfing .,i love it but that is only one small facet of why i love the ocean .,i just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times i 've had there .,whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water .,"skateboarding down the boardwalk , trying to race the waves as they peel away .","just sitting on the sand with my good friends , talking about anything and everything at the same time .","or going there alone , at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day , week , month , or even year .",the ocean can do all of that

would have to do .","i came here and had to leave the biggest , most passionate part of me back home .",that 's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be .,it 's not that i feel like i 'm

my throat hurts really bad these past two days but i kind of like it cause when my voice is scratchy it makes me feel sexy .,"but the problem with that is two-fold , one- why should i want to feel sexy if i already have a boyfriend ?",does that mean i want a different one ?,and two i should n't be kissing my boyfriend if my throat is scratchy so it does n't matter if i feel sexy .,"that whole situation reminds me of the friends episode when phoebe had a cold and she was a super good singer because the phelgm made her feel sexy , but since i 'm not a singer i really do n't have any useful outputs for my cold and it just",makes me feel gross .,what i 'm afraid of with all this is that i 'm thinking about what to type and then typing it rather than just typing thoughts as they come .,hopefully you wo n't have time to read this though so you wo n't know about my concern of how honest my stream of consciousness is really being .,sometimes i want to be an artist because i think that it 's really incredible to be able to depict what you think something resembles .,"but i could never do that because my hands do n't have the talent that my mind does- so i think of great things but then i 'm never able to really express them , that 's probably why most artists are insane because they ca n't perfectly match their",impression of something with their depiction of something .,right now our neighbor guy is playing classic rock really loud and it 's kind of distracting me .,"i would go tell him to turn it down but i do n't want to interrupt my stream , and also i think he 's creepy because he touches my stomach a lot and he gives me these really intense stares and i 'm like whoa ?","but another creepy thing happened today , my ex-boyfriends mom sent me this clipping of him in the paper and was like just thought you might want to see this clipping about anthony in the navy .",e-mail me to keep up and good luck with classes !,weird .,"one , i only met the lady like twice , i did n't even get formally introduced to her .","two , how did she get my address ?","and three , lady your son and i broke up .","let 's move on with our lives , shall we ?",there 's something about the taste of sick in your mouth .,"a sore throat or something , but when i coughed jsut now it reminded me of halloween .",strange .,but that 's probably got something to do with all this crazy stuff in the brain that 's going on .,man it just boggles me .,my roommate is in the shower and i just heard this crash of bottles and she laughed .,it reminds me of something i do everyday .,"i just laughed , she 's a really great roommate .",just like i have a great family and a great boyfriend .,"if i make the crew team i think my life will be perfect , even though i know i should n't depend it on that .",it just seems like a dream .,after being depressed for so long it 's really nice to be alone and realize that i 'm happy .,i just have a ton of stuff to be thankful for .,"sometimes i think about the things i would change about myself and i would definately make myself more grateful , and i would be more prude about kissing .",i think kissing is really trivialized and it makes me sad .,sometimes i want my life to be like a movie and have incredible kisses that you can just hear the music start up with .,slow ones that really communicate something .,ones where you 're not thinking about how the guy 's tongue feels or if he has good breath but all you can think about is how good he makes you feel and how much you like or love him .,i think the reason why i used to be depressed was because i wanted everything to be perfect like a movie and slowly i started feeling like my life just did n't stack up .,but the truth is is that in the grand scheme of things it 's like damn !,"i 've not only got two legs , two arms , and 20 fingers , but on top of that i also have the great roommate , great family , and great boyfriend , great friends , a great mind , and not too much sadness .",i think people always dramatize things because they do n't know what they 're looking for in life but they figure that people will suddenly pay attention to them and they 'll figure it out .,"almost anyone wants attention- that 's why people try to committ suicide , why people cry , it 's the explanation for so much .",how weird is that that okasy i lost that thought but i 'm still typing .,"i 'm a die hard stream of consiouicness writer , i breeeze buy typos , not a problem for me .",but the classic rock is .,i 'm ready to destroy his speakers i think .,music should say stuff- not just be a bunch of noise .,music should be stream of consciousness because it would reveal truths in life .,is n't that what it 's all about ?,the ttruth ?,now i sound like my ex-boyfriend who was obsessed with plato and searching for the truth .,he invented this kissing thing called the euclidian vacuum .,it was way creepy .,i want to talk about my cat willy cause i miss

people trying out though .,i think like 130 people are going for 32 spots .,i hope i make it though because i do n't deal well with failure .,"i tried out for the soccer team and did not make it , but that was a little unfair because i did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did .",so now everyone probably thinks i just was n't good enough when that really was not the reason .,i

that .,or maybe i do n't understand why i do that .,"like , i would invite everyone to come with me if i was doing something cool .",but all the people around me just i think are selfish .,maybe i just need to find a whole new group of friends .,"i mean , i had my first day of tryouts for crew , which was a pretty big deal to me .","and when i see my boyfriend , he does n't even ask how i did .",he totally forgot about it .,that gets me so mad .,he seems to forget about everything .,he then says how he is a bad boyfriend .,"unfortunately , i have to agree with him .",but do n't get the

afraid to talk about it .,i just do n't like talking about it .,"i consider it a private thing , and should just be shared between two people .",it is nobody else 's business .,"but i guess since we are in college , that is the way things are .",sex is on everyone 's mind .,but it just does n't really seem to be on my mind very much .,i would much rather just cuddle that have sex .,"maybe i am weird , i do n't know .",but that drives my boyfriend crazy .,he want 's to have sex all the time .,i think that is a major problem in our relationship .,oh well .,"well , i guess my time is about up

just so gross and .,blah .,"oh well , he has to make that decision on his own , i ca n't make it for him .","anyways continuing on , one of my roomates is gettin on my nerves .","i have 3 roomates in total , and we get along pretty good , but this one roomate , ahh !",shes annoying !,shes always trying to tell me that im not doing something right !,and its always stupid stuff !,"like , she told me

more stressful right now too !,"sometimes i wish my parents could just tell me how to live my life , it would just make everything sooo much easier on everyone !","but i guess thats the college life , its just very new to me still .","like , i enjoy not having my parents there telling me to study , or when my curfew is , but i do miss that parental aspect that i used to have in my life .",college has a bunch of pluses .,and minuses .,its not all parties and having fun like some people .,"well i guess it is for some people , but personally not all that much for me .",( thats another thing about

was a trip .,"when i was there , i could n't wait to get out of there .","i hated that school , that town , everything except my friends , of course .","then , my family moved , right after graduation

.","after i moved , i had no friends , no life , no car , no nothing .",i worked all day .,that 's it .,"now , though , i 'm ready for this whole college thing .","austin seems like a fun city , where

if i was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness , where it took me , and what that means regarding my own personality .","i guess if i had to , i could say that my mind works in mysterious ways , and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected , to me , i can see the patterns .",yeah .,"i just went back & tried to read this over again , and i 've got to give a suggestion .","for these assignments , make the box we 're writing in a box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time , without have to scroll across , because it 's a real big pain for

today was an easy day for me since i only had two classes to attend .,"in math , i really had a hard time staying awake .",i did n't know if it was because i knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me .,"either way , i was very tired and at times , i just dozed off .","in my edp class , i had to find information on financial aide .",i also had to start a checking account at the credit union .,"by chance in the corner of my eyes , i could a brochure on financial loans for students .",so i picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation .,right now i 'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on friday .,it 's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not .,i probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology is n't really an easy class .,tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend .,english at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me .,i had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up .,"i tries to call tex many times , but had no luck .",now i have to get used to waking up early every tuesday and thursday at about 7:30 in the morning .,"it 's a pain in the butt , but the good thing is that i can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology .","i really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on wednesday , i did n't take one and when i attended the class , i had a hard time staying awake .",i 'm glad that i 'm in college now because i feel more independent than at home .,my mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she is n't able to do it anymore .,but it gets to a point where i kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick .,i ca n't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother .,i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back .,i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother .,he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it .,"he still thinks he can beat me , but that wo n't probably ever be true until i 'm about 60 and he 's 57. this weekend , i hope to attend the football game with my friends again .",i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot .,it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed .,a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before .,it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me .,i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games .,i might even paint my face to show some school spirit .,maybe not .,"after i finish this assignment , i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday .",i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment .,the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it .,my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited .,"i think that is cool because in high school , there was n't a writing center that would help you with your paper .",you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you do n't have a clue .,i guess that 's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that 's a great feeling to have .,the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book .,i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo 's was out of them .,"textbooks are very expensive in college , but it 's probably worth it when it comes to things you do n't understand or for the test .",the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store .,i think my time is up so that 's all i 'm going to write .,i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that 's the purpose of this essay .,"so , that 's all .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i have n't been in the mood to do any homework .,i find it very hard just to sit down and study .,"as a freshmen , i have found many new experiences in the past week .","finally getting my email hooked up , i received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week .",my good friend from home wrote me from south west .,she informed me of great news .,she is having a ball at her new school .,"she is on the drill team , and making many new friends .",which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday ( sunday ) .,"as i came home from church , i was excited to see that i had two messages all for me !",: ) the first one is from a friend who attends ut .,"the other was from my best friend , who sadly is going to another college in wacol .","we could only talk for about fifteen minutes , which was n't enough time .","however , it was long enough so i could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends .",which leads me to the point that i am feeling terribly lonely .,"i do n't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes , but i am envious .","see , i came to ut because i did n't want to go to a & m because my brother went there .",ut and a & m were the only two schools which i applied .,"truthfully , i am not too excited about coming here .","however , i do n't want to go to a & m .",it 's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home .,"anyway , so i moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud .",so i have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home !,i am always here all by myself .,i have a total of four friends up here .,"one of which , heather , i spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views

grade and did n't talk to her much my junior and senior years .,"you see her and lindsey are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking , so me being the insincere person which i am takes lindsey 's side .",my reasoning was because i thought sandra was inconsiderate of others needs .,"you see , i had every single class with her our sophomore year , and we kind of got tired of each other .",so back to the present .,"i do n't really know anybody , and i am bad at meeting people because i do n't know what to say .","do n't think i 'm quite or shy because that 's far from it , but i just do n't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation .",which leaves me very lonely .,it 's mainly my fault because i do n't want to spend much time with heather

so homesick that she does n't want to do anything .","and sandra , who called me yesterday just to talk .",now how nice is that ?,"i mean , i went to sandra 's today before class , and i had fun .","she 's nice , not to mention beautiful , skinny , and very smart ( very .",) which i guess why i used to have bad feelings towards her .,she 's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends

was stuck in the freshmen class .,it is so bad .,i 've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight .,not to mention there is no pointe here !,"i am not trying to sound smug ,

my own benefit and work on techinque , but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination , to tell us were to `` place our arm on the barre '' i almost died",i know where to put it .,i do n't need help with that .,"i need help with my turnout , extension , balance !",not with were to put my arm on the barre !,"well , as you can see i am not excactly a happy camper .","i 'm glad i wrote

another topic .,i have no classes on friday 's so now i 'm out for the weekend .,i just realized if i close my eyes and type it is a lot easier to think .,so if there are any typos that is the reason .,because from now on i refuse to open my eyes .,let my type the lyrics of the last song i wrote .,it was about my ex girlfriend to broke up with me for no reason at all .,for the third time .,i loved her and it tore me up so bad everytime she did that .,and i took her back twice after she did it but the third time i had to let her go .,she had issues .,and she hates this song because she heard it for the first time at the talent show last year .,it did n't go over too well with her .,here is goes .,this song is called late night song '' i wrote it really late the night she broke up with me .,"hence the name : i spend my time alone , i wish you know the sadness that has grown , i fell in love , and it only fell apart , i never knew , i could have a broken heart .","and i hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and i wish the time was still , cause we do n't have long before we 're gone and this late night song is all you 'll ever have .","its been a week today , the time has gone and i still feel the same .","so hear this song , and try to make it last , its all you 'll hear , cause i regret my past .","and i hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shard and i wish , the time were still , we do n't have long before we 're going to and this late night song , is all you 'll ever have",", and i hate the way we lived , and i want to know where i stand , and i hate the way we lived , and i want to know who i am .","and i hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and i wish , the time were still , we do n't have long before we 're gone and this late night song is all you 'll lever have .",there it is .,it is a very popular song anywhere we go .,its one of the favorites on the cd because a lot of people can connect with it .,i have gotten emails telling me that people play it for their ex-girlfriends for revenge .,because of the ' i regret my past ' part .,that 's the part that got my ex girlfriend too .,i 'm listening to a song called goodnight elizabeth right now and it reminds me of my older brother ' x ex-girlfriend .,her name was elizabeth and she was one of the prettiest girls ever .,the song actually resembles their relationship .,my brother went to college at tulane in new orleans .,"and this song said i miss you in new orleans , but now i 'm the king of the rain .",which is probably referring to the rainy weather in southern louisiana .,wo n't you fall down on me know wo n't you fall down on me .,i love that lyric .,cz i 'm alone and your comin down .,we just settle down down down down into home .,i really respect counting crowes lyrics .,they are one of the best bands ever in my mind .,once our band starts getting bigger .,we will change music i believe .,our lead singer is amazing .,and he is not like all the other singers out there .,it is unique and all his lyrics are from the heart .,his mother died of brain cancer a few years back and ever since then he has written the saddest and most beautiful songs .,"i did n't expect to be in college this year because of all the record company attention we have gotten lately and my parents agreed to if we got signed to a label , then we would n't be in school .",right now we are very close to the signing .,and i 'm not sure if i will finish this semester or go live the life i will live for the rest of my life .,i just wish i could major in being a rockstar .,beyond the band .,"i have nothing real in my life , my band is my life , and if i ever lose the guys , i will lose my life .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what ?,it 's only the 4th day of classes .,that 's a horrible thing to think about .,i stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage .,it 's awful .,i 've been on some other floors and it does n't smell like that .,"i wonder if it 's the carpet or something , but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it , so that 's cool i guess .",i got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow .,i 'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that .,yeah right .,"this oatmeal cream pie is great , i 'm so hungry because i have n't eaten all day yet , and all my professors successfully fried my brain .",i hate when i do n't know everything .,"well i do n't mean everything because nobody knows everything , but more like .","i hate when i ca n't understand something right away , probably because i know that means i have to spend extra time learning it later on and that 's never any fun .","i swear that when i used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger , so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something .","i would n't be surprised , or maybe now i 'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself , instead of when i used to eat them years ago .",who knows ?,or actually who cares .,"kate just called me and she 's not going to eat until later , so guess that means i 'm going to the chem .","review at 5. it 'll probably be really good for me so i should n't complain , but complaining is so fun , yet so annoying all at the same time .","i ca n't believe that i 'm actually excited about going home this weekend , not for long , but i kind of feel like i 'm missing out on so much in san antonio , even though i 'm not .",i ca n't wait to get some good mexican food .,it 's been too long .,what a horrible affect working at a mexican restaurant all summer had on me .,oh well .,the football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !,"i 'm so excited , my first ut football games as a student in the student section .",ha-ha .,"and actually i think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see , how cool .",i saw something on austin 's news talking about ordering the games on ppv .,that 's crazy .,i really hope that does n't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and i ca n't watch them .,like the away games for example .,that 'd be so cool if i could get tickets to the ou game .,"i hear that there 's nothing like it , and i 'm sure that 's true .",but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks .,and assuming that you get all that taken care of .,"you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going , meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well , pretty crazy , but i guess if all else fails i can order ir ppv for 40 bucks .","yeah right , that game better be on abc or something .","i actually called kenny today , after my first biology class .","he did n't answer , hopefully it was because he was in class .",i do n't know why but for some reason i really feel like he does n't like me the way he did before i went down to san antonio this past weekend .,it 's cool i guess .,"since i 'm here and he 's there , but i do n't know .","i wish that we would n't of met , so that i would n't have to deal with it .",but then again i do n't wish that because he 's a cool guy .,"so much like me though , it 's kind of scary .","i wish that i could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday , but then again .","if he did that i would n't like him , since it 's all about the chase .",crazy how those things work out .,he 's been exceptionally mean though .,"well just yesterday , but like he says it 's his way of flirting , but ha-ha whatever .",i like that boy .,dang i just admitted it .,i do n't like him actually .,i just do n't know .,i definitely do n't think we 're each others types though .,he belongs around a much more rowdy `` karla '' type and he might just be a little too crazy for me .,sounds like a challenge .,"i 'm pretty hungry for like some real food , i guess i 'll go down to jcl in a little bit and find something , that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just did n't do it for me .",and i 'm exceptionally tired too .,"i ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning , and i do n't think it even helped me that much since i barely got a b on the homework .","man , i miss high school

.,because i was one of the 69 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration .,i feel bad telling people that though .,it makes me feel stuck-up .,i do n't want to be stuck up .,i know too many people who are and i see others talking behind their backs .,i really do n't want that to ever happen .,"actually , i 'm pretty happy with myself the way it is ( or was in illinois ) i had a lot of really close friendships that i left behind .","some are still kind-of open ended , i did n't get to say goodbye , and other things like that .",i made my plane tickets today .,"i get to leave on tuesday to go home for thanksgiving , and on the 12th for christmas .",i ca n't wait .,"i want to see how everyone has changed , and i guess , hope that they did n't change

in about 30 minutes i have to start getting ready for work .,"i do n't want to go , but i need to make money so i can go out .",my mom called me yesterday and said that my bank account was getting low and she wanted to know what i was spending it on .,"i was supposed to use the money for a stereo , but it 's amazing how fast five hundred dollars can go in austin .",i love austin so far .,tonight i 'm going to a corry morrow concert .,"i should probably stay home and study , but i would like to meet more people in austin too , so i 'll probably still go .",my mom also griped at me about how i need to study more .,i just spent seven dollars today on washing clothes .,this makes me mad because i can think of much better things to do with my money besides wash clothes .,four loads of clothes costs seven dollars .,how ridiculous .,i 'm going home on saturday because one of my friends is turning nineteen and they are having a party for him .,"i just went back home like two weeks ago , but i do n't want to miss his birthday .",i ca n't wait to see everyone from back home .,my roommate is cooking her some roman noodles and i ca n't decide if i want to eat some or not .,i do n't think so .,"i really wanted to lay out by the pool today , because i really need to get a tan , but i spent the whole day cleaning house and washing clothes .",what fun !,i have n't gotten any of my checks in from work yet and it 's making me wonder because i have been working there for a while now and only one check so far has come in .,i guess they do n't realize i 'm a college student and i need money as soon as possible .,i really want to get a tattoo and that is probably the main reason i want my checks to start coming in .,if my mom knew that i wanted a tattoo she would kill me .,"oh well , i 'll keep it a secret for a while , and then by the time she finds out it will have already been a long time since i got it .","my roommate wants one too , but she 's already talked to her mom about it .",i really need to go to an audio store because my system in my car stopped working and i ca n't stand not having bass when i listen to music .,it better get done soon .,i really need to read this book for a freshmen seminar class i have .,"the book is pretty boring , but it 's easy reading so i guess i 'll survive .",i 'm really dreading going to work in a minute .,i wish i could just skip to tonight and go out already .,that just sounds so much more appealing !,"i have to go to the bathroom , but i guess i 'm not supposed to because i have to sit here and keep typing my thoughts .","my roommate has the t. v. on and it 's kind of hard for me to keep my train of thought , but i guess that is the whole point to just write down everything that is going through your head .","the drive home on saturday is going to be so long , but it will be worth it i guess because it is going to be so much fun .",it feels so nice to have a clean house .,i just cleaned my room for the first time in about a week and it was getting pretty bad .,my roommates boyfriend is sleeping right now and i have the music pretty loud .,i should probably turn it down .,we went out last night .,we went to someone 's apartment and it was n't that fun .,oh yeah !,i forgot the cops came .,good thing they were n't coming for us thought because that would have sucked if the party would have been broken up .,i did n't even swim with everyone else because i did n't bring my bathing suit .,i hope i remember to bring it next time because it looked really fun to sit in the hot tub .,i 'm fixing to pee in my pants .,i wish this timer would hurry up and run out .,i just took that pretest for the experimental requirement too and that had to be the longest testing thing i have ever taken .,i did n't think it was ever going to end .,i guess the hour and a half of credit they give you for doing it is well worth it .,i 'm getting pretty nervous about all the tests that are coming up .,it seems like they are all during the same week .,that is going to kill me i just know it .,the more i think about those tests the more i think i should probably stay home tonight .,naa !,i 'll just go out .,i find myself

i 'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind .,this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote to the lighthouse and mrs. dalloway .,her name will come to me in just a second .,she was a very depressed person i still ca n't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die .,"oh well , i ca n't remember her name write now .",it is strange that i ca n't remember her name considering i read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work .,i think i ca n't remember because i feel too much stress the remember it .,"in fact , i feel like right when i stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head .",i can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head .,ok i am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what i read earlier today from c. s. lewis ' mere christianity .,it is amazing how much i am learning about the christian faith and i have been a christian for a while now .,i like what lewis says about society and morality .,how what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men .,no matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion .,well i think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id .,i will vehemently oppose such a measure .,it is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than i can write .,so while i 'm in the middle of writing this sentence i have already thought of 2 other things .,i am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics .,"to get to such high positions of power , one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but i wonder if that is really true i wonder if there can be honest politicians i wonder if there can be honest lawyers .",i surely hope so you know i remember reading one that diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day .,i wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has i still ca n't believe she is dead you know i feel like i am kind of censoring what i write because of the possibility that so ta might,what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it .,i think i probably would if i were a ta it must be really difficult to be a ta and be a grad student .,it is hard enough just being an undergrad student .,my head kind of hurts right now i wonder if that is from stress i think it is .,my apartment is quiet right now i am very glad i did n't go out with my roommates i like being by myself every once and a while .,i love not having to worry about any body but myself but i also love being around people .,i really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together i guess everything has its ups and downs even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on tuesday and thursday,instead of on mwf i 'm really now to nervous right now but i am sure i will get stressed out this semester i really need to learn how to deal with my stress .,if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit .,ok i only have to write for a couple more minutes .,it is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about it seems like i think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever i have quite time to myself i wonder why that is i am excited about this psychology class .,learning about human behavior is always interesting to me i think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- i guess sort of a power issue i hope that now why i am interested in psychology ., , , , , , , , , , , ,

wants to marry her so i do n't know how thats going to turn out .,i was really proud of him tho because he confronted her about it and i hope she realized what shes doing to him .,"well imean , she knows but she doesnt realize that hes a person .","to her , hes just this guy who follows her around and worships her like a goddess .","you know , which is nice , but he ca n't please her anymore .",shes picky about how he stands and if she doesnt even want to see him no matter what he does she gets mad at him .,its really sad because hes a great guy and hes a good friend of mine .,we havent really been able to talk much lately because hes busy worshipping steff and not looking for time to spend with me .,but thats ok im not bitter .,im kind of scared about my classes too .,i havent has any real work so either im missing something very important or its all going to pile up on me later and kill me .,"like a mudslide , its going to be ugly .",i do have that calculus homework that i could be working on right now but im so un-motivated to do math right now so im writing for my psychology class .,"how nice , i know .",my aunt sent me a care package in the mail today .,it was so exciting to open up my tiny little mail box and find a pink slip saying i had a package waiting for me .,she sent me cookies and icing and 25 dollars to target .,"lots of cool stuff at that place , target .",maybe i can get more workout clothes for when i go to the gym .,"maybe if i ever feel like i do n't wnt to go anyore , ill just stare at all my clothes in the closet and feel guilty about spending money on them and i might as well use them .",i love how i know how my brain will work .,i miss my boyfriend a lot .,hes a year younger than me and hes still back in san antonio .,i know he misses me too .,and he has a car but he ca n't drive it because it doesnt work .,which is even worse because i want him to drive up to austin and see me !,but alas .,i have to wait to see him when i go back into town .,which is like every other weekend .,"but also my parents are selling my car so unless he gets that car fixed , i wo n't even be able to see him then !",its so sad .,i like cookies i got a new alarm for college that has a really big display on it and has dual alarms ( one for monday'wednesday classes and another for tuesday'thrusday classes !,) but the sound it makes is sooooo annoying !,"it makes this click right before it goes off and thats what wakes me up , the sound of dread .",i could recognize that click anyday and it would strike a feeling of loathing into my heart .,also the snooze button is really small and close to the alarm shut off button so i not only have to look for the button but to be careful how i smack the machine .,i have a 12 pack of highlighters that i havent used yet .,well i 've usd them but only for coloring things and un-highlighter like things .,also my friend russell is having girl problems .,i do n't know the whole story so i ca n't go into that .,yeah and my roommate thinks i like him .,"she makes a big deal of it , so i think shes the one who likes him .",but i dunno .,hes really cool .,i have another friend who is having girl problems too .,this is really weird .,i do n't know his story either because he wouldnt tell me .,but he will sooner or later because i can beat it out of him .,why are guys having problems right now ?,i have a cow from chic-fil-a sitting on my computer monitor and hes wearing a sign that says chikin on a bun .,"pure geenius and his arms are like lopsided because hes a cheaply made toy , but it

im fat .",moo .,20 minutes is a lot longer than i thought .,im running out of things to say .,maybe i should type slower .,my fingers are cold from typing .,its relly cold in my room .,do people atully read these things ?,"i mean , what if someone wrote about how great the sex was with their girlfriend ?",would the writing czar be offended ?,or would they publish it and read it outloud .,how do i know that the writing czar even cares about what i think .,"if i were in high school still i would say this is busy work , but i guess ill give you guys the benefit of the doubt that you know what youre doing and since this is a psych class that it must prove something .",i just hope i can be enlightened when this is over .,i want to sit back and be in awe at what this tells me about myself .,kind of like those tests and thespark .,com .,those are fun to do .,can we do that for another writing assignment ?,they have iq tests and personality tests and any other kind of testyou can possibly imagine .,they even have a test that will determine what sex you are based on how you answer certain questions and past test takers and such .,but since this is a psych class imsure everyone

today i had a fairly busy day i believe as i am feeling a bit tired right now .,i wonder what time it is .,oh it 's 9:14 p. m. right now so i guess i can continue writing this assignment .,haha i 'm just kidding .,i feel good about myself right now because earlier today i helped somebody out who needed it .,"she is my sister 's friend , i guess an acquaintance for me , and one of the tires on her car got a flat .","she and my sister both did n't know what to do , so my sister called me and i came and fixed her tire for her .",after that she bought my sister and me dinner as a way to say thanks .,i feel better now than i used to about a week and a half ago because i tried out for the marching band here but i did n't make it .,i was really depressed for a day or two because i 've been involved with band for the past seven years of my life in high school and middle school .,but after awhile i began to realize a few of the benefits of not being in band .,"for example , i do n't have to buy those stupid white plastic shoes all the members are required to wear so i can save some money .",also i have a lot more free time than i 've had in a long time .,it feels really good to be able to take long naps in the middle of the day without having to worry about practice '' at 6 p. m. in the evening and interrupting my sleep .,"man , that timer on the top of the screen is going really slow .",it says it has only been eight minutes but it feels like twenty already .,my wrists are beginning to hurt .,i want to listen to music on my computer right now but i ca n't because my roommate is on his cell phone talking to his friend and i know my music will only bother him .,we do n't share the same taste in music .,"in fact , i think we are as far as possible in our tastes in that category .",i think these chairs they give us for our dorms are very uncomfortable .,"i mean , they 're completely wooden with no cushioning at all .","you would think that in the honors dorm we would get special treatment of some kind , but so far i think we are being treated the exact same way as the freshmen who are going to drop out at the end of the semester .",it 's hard to concentrate right now because i usually need music to help me concentrate .,i like the upbeat kind of music that has a constant bass drum playing really loudly on all of the down beats .,i also like classical music and music that has drums and stringed instruments at the same time .,"i 'm not sure what the kind of music is called , though .","however , i do n't like oldies or country music at all .","in fact , i hate that kind of music .",that 's why my roommate and i do n't share the same tastes .,he likes that kind of music .,i just heard somebody running down the hall of my floor at a really high rate .,i wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 9:30p .,m. maybe he was running to get more beer for the party .,just kidding again .,no need to get investigators up here or anything .,"but earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people , so something was definitely going on .",i was thinking about emailing that dj guy for our class .,"i do n't remember his name , though .","i have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class , and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and does n't think he is .",he thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him .,ok !,i only have one minute left .,"after this , i think i 'm going to get ready for bed because all this sigmund freud type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy .",i think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than i thought i was when i first started typing this ., , , , , ,

the first thing that comes to mind as i sit here is an immense feeling of relief .,i have just finished the rough draft of my rhetoric paper .,it 's due tomorrow and i was n't sure i could pull it together .,"it 's not up to the standard of writing i like , but that 's why it 's a rough draft .",i find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since i got here .,"i know that sounds a little weird , but it 's actually a good thing .","the first night i was here , i was sitting back listening to my music and reading when i thought about home and everything that had gone on there .",i remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days .,it was n't homesickness .,something about the song i was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky i am .,i 've had a great life .,my parents were very supportive in whatever i did and still are .,my friends were always there for me and i never endured any life tragedies .,the truth is that i really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home .,"it just brought back mental photos of friends , girlfriends , and what i personally considered an ideal life .",i really do think i 've led an ideal life .,"never hurt for money , never abused , never had problems making friends .","the only thing i consider a life tragedy is the fact that i did n't get a new car for graduation , but it was that or tuition and i fought to hard to get here to not come .",i think that i 'll love it here .,"actually , i already do .",most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college .,i do n't see how .,"the people around me are great , my classes interest me , and i 'm

really looking forward to this weekend and the next .,"this weekend i 'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls , one of which i am finding myself attracted to .",the next weekend is another football game .,"i 'm in the band , so football games are a fun time for me .","marching in front of 80,000+ people is intimidating , but it 's also a rush that words really ca n't do justice for .","of course , that 's only half the fun .",the real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands .,i 'm glancing at my clock and see that i 've only got about ten minutes left ?,how am i going to ramble on for another ten minutes .,"i write fiction stories for fun , love english , and am a journalism major .",rambling writing style for me .,i wonder why i 'm occasionally having trouble continuing .,who knows ?,psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick .,maybe one of ya 'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these

i do n't know how other people ( freshmen ) are coping with this new transition from high school to college ; i feel stress out .,hmm .,maybe i 'm not so completely at ease like i had claimed earlier .,"i suppose that i am at ease at this moment is because i do n't have any class to go to for hours , and that i think i am at ease right now , is because this is the second week of classes .","however , i 'm still stress , very much so .",( i feel like i 'm rambling on and on here .,) i am so very much relief that i have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments .,i like to try to do things ahead of time so that i wo n't be in any jams later on .,"besides , what with the way my schedule is set , i have to budget my time wisely .","moreover , i am worried that i wo n't be able to get high grades as i did when i was in high school .",everything in college is so very different and challenging .,"sometimes , i feel as if i ca n't keep up with other people .",i admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them .,i just ca n't do that .,i 'm the type that has to put in `` extra work '' so that i can keep up with them .,"i 'm not saying that i 'm stupid , gosh no !",i believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways .,hmmm .,"there is one thing , rather , one small minor fear that i just ca n't seem to overcome : fear of animals , especially dogs .","well , i took the pretest and in there , it had asked me questions about animal phobia .","i really want to know what these fears mean , which brings me to another thought .","i always have questions , such questions that are so detailed some people called it `` stupid questions. `` i always find myself having questions about everything .",i guess i 'm just a curious person .,hmmmm .,i guess this is enough typing for this assignment .,i ca n't think of anything else to write about .,"who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment , i 'm sorry it is n't anything that is as exciting as you 'll like it to be .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.89275 -0.507619 0.428917 -0.784244 -0.008369 0.091634 0.293296 -0.143302 0.755299 -1.037271 -0.159153 -0.590446 0.551784 -0.222503 0.365195 0.0 -0.04277 -0.307414 0.40337 -0.795527 0.211358 -0.348897 -0.960748 -0.546943 -0.624052 -1.765822 1.129459 -0.183362 0.110571 -0.209404 -0.503477 3.231819 0.40767 3.329548 -0.05804 -1.109326 -1.03972 -0.69139 0.525009 -2.112965 -0.073616 0.410554 0.427214 -0.505889 -0.884143 -0.192589 0.461106 -0.278546 1.101054 -0.659933 0.789311 -0.715559 -0.200888 1.116624 -0.620268 0.912009 2.452454 -0.954251 0.222785 0.518231 -0.831376 0.959374 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 6.339562 -0.086094 -0.010822 0.716889 0.173769 1.177326 -0.607823 -0.054108 -0.337085 1.944946 1.044797 2.641917 0.505123 0.963894 4.94372 4.395212 4.63438 5.021572 4.32132,636
okay so i 'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and i see trees and squirrels and birds .,i really like my dorm because when i walk outside to go to class .,i always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe i should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute .,i 'm trying to think what i 've done today because i feel like i 'm wasting the day away .,i woke up at about 12:30 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed .,we all went to subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 30 minutes .,i came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves .,her boyfriend broke up with her 2 days ago and she definitely is n't being the sweetest person .,"she is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me , she freaks out .",i think she is jealous .,but what is there to be jealous of ?,it 's not like i have a wonderful boyfriend .,my ex boyfriend .,travis .,he goes to utsa because he did n't get into ut .,he will be here in a year .,well .,he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk .,i feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems .,hmmm .,well basically he ( travis ) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him .,we were together for almost 2 years .,well i told him we might be able to get back together but really i have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to ut and by then hopefully i will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him .,i love him still and it frustrates me .,college frustrates me right now .,i always had a lot of work in high school so i am used to the work load but i am just boggled down with things to do .,like laundry .,and sorority crap that is pointless .,we had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and i skipped out on it .,i feel guilty '' but then i do n't .,i did n't see the point in spending the night at the chi-o house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 51 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at scottish rite .,i do n't think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever .,oh well .,what can i do ?,nothing .,i miss my friends .,hmmmmm .,i never thought i would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so i could escape from all the petty college stuff .,like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking ( seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting `` wasted '' .,it 's like the girls in my dorm ( which is an all girls dorm ) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they 've experienced `` frat parties '' they ca n't get enough .,do n't get me wrong .,i love partying and the occasional wild nights but then i also believe that frat parties get old .,on a different topic .,i have a bunch of homework to do .,at least i 'm getting this done and i 'm enjoying it at the moment .,it 's very relaxing .,typing whatever i want .,not having a strict curriculum to follow .,i wish i could meet some guys that are n't just interested in sex .,that grosses me out .,look .,my thoughts are running rampant .,but then i also miss things with travis .,but then i do n't miss travis because i 'm in austin .,doing whatever i want .,"in the heart of the city , but then i stayed home last night .",a saturday night and i was in bed .,i guess i 'm some sort of loser .,i almost feel like if i do n't party every single night i am like the biggest loser ut has ever seen .,i need to separate myself from all this greek b. s. hmmm .,you know what else i need to do .,laundry .,read pyschology .,calculus homework .,that 's another thing that worries me .,the difficulty of my calculus class .,i have already found a tutor and i 'm having mass problems with the homework .,oh well .,i 'll get through it somehow right ?,i have tutoring tonight at 6. is n't this little story of my life so interesting .,i need like 4 boyfriends at one time like my friend kim or like 20 activities to do at one time like my friend geoff .,no i really do n't need to deal with that stuff actually .,i have problems enough worrying about what i should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my calculus homework will take me ( probably 3 hours ) .,wonderful .,so much to look forward to .,so little time .,i need to relax .,i need a back massage .,i need my mom 's cooking and my own bathroom .,i wo n't be getting those things for a long looong time .,i have no plans on going home .,if i go home my curfew will be midnight .,funny how the parties in austin do n't actually start till midnight .,oh another thing .,i hope i make good grades to make my mom happy .,she seriously is worried about me and my grades .,she probably thinks i 'm partying so much which is not the case at all .,i think i actually am in my dorm too much .,wait .,she is going to get mad because i went shopping and used her credit card .,oh lord .,i 'll be getting a call in a couple weeks .,`` lindsey .,what is this arden b store on my credit card bill ?,and why did you spend [ ] amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways ?,'' oh no .,well i have been doing this for 19 min and 11 seconds and it went by pretty fast .,and i 'm sure whoever reads this will be like `` what is this girl talking about ?,'' but that 's okay because i 'm sure there 's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment # 1 's .,well my 20 min are up and i am closing this lovely `` stream of consciousness '' with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch .,you will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her .,she was made to be wooed and won by youth ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i do n't understand how the man with the questions can be the smarter of the two .,the man with the answers has to be the smarter .,all the man with the questions know 's that he know 's what he does n't know and wants to .,but the man with the answers know 's .,whatever he want to know he knows because that 's how the question goes .,there 's no way for the man with the questions to more than the man with all the answers .,"one , the answer guy 's going to know the answer .",and people are always going well does he know how to get the answer ?,well of course he does .,just ask him how he got that answer .,and he 'll answer that question .,what i do n't understand is how this teacher is going to believe and only think that she 's right .,the answer was completely easy to comprehend .,i hate that teachers get so arrogant .,just because they know more of the subject they think they 're knowledge is invincible against all others .,how can you teach others and let them learn if you 're unwelling to learn yourself ?,it 's totally bull .,makes no sense to me .,always dreamed about being a super hero .,guess it 's somewhat ironic that my vietnamese name translates to mean hero .,i do n't know i guess i have some type of super-hero complex .,always want to help others always want special powers .,always wanted to win the girl .,always a dream about this girl .,never see a face and can never hear her talk .,i can see her figure and i can see how graceful she is .,she walks be side me in my dreams .,always want to hold her hand but afriad that i 'll wake up when i touch her .,so i walk beside her and look at her .,i know i 'm going to meet this person .,i can sense it .,real into the `` crow '' look the romantic dark super-hero adventure story .,brings out the use of love .,people always take love for granted and if not love the good fortune that they get to be with or have a relationship with others .,wonder if i 'm a hopeless romantic .,i can see myself taking my date on a walk or just laying there with her and talking .,"i do n't see the sex , not that i would n't , or much else .",the tai kwon do club at this university is not very well trained .,the main instructor may be a good fighter but his form sucks .,to me form is the most important part of martial arts .,adds gracefulness and at the experienced level makes movements faster stronger and completely balanced .,it all comes from form .,the traingle is speed balance and strength and not of that comes from bad form .,or at least none of those three will continously exel without balance .,most people do n't see it that way .,they think that compromising form for quick speed and strength is better .,but they do n't look in the long run .,just like in chess the game is all about the long run .,"and with mastering balance , speed and strength will always become faster and stronger .",then there are those that are lazy and do n't even care for form and try to show off their katas with feet not lined up and hands out of place .,with such bad alignment energy will not flow correctly .,people get so arrogant and greedy ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.408047 -0.161456 -0.526528 -0.383733 -0.240583 -2.539187 0.86526 1.7597 -0.033161 -0.272367 -0.204411 -0.04908 -0.318062 0.136158 0.027974 0.0 -0.04277 -2.131767 -2.465543 -0.795527 -2.815569 0.040639 1.66261 1.59149 -0.018878 1.919374 -0.188373 -0.593467 0.645026 1.417459 1.27485 3.208505 -0.587944 -0.906028 0.573907 -0.686417 1.869473 0.5925 4.877816 -0.690748 -0.398536 -0.814489 3.445433 0.924787 2.18823 -0.348597 0.281464 1.045771 0.602462 0.932132 2.620834 -1.674904 -1.773124 1.890163 0.449136 -0.790413 -1.213157 -0.238615 1.123308 0.70174 1.246559 -0.241888 -0.480161 1.09802 -0.088502 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.532014 -1.039706 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.634784 -0.37208 0.145863 0.362859 0.730523 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.104308 4.558713 3.623379 4.197649 4.231798 5.041238,828
i know i said that i was ready to write but im not too sure exactly what i need to be doing .,i hope this is right .,great now im worrying .,i worry way too much that is a problem of mine .,i always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it i even worry about other people 's problems .,i wish i could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend joseph .,he 's also my roommate .,now im now sure if this is right because im telling you about myself when im just supposed to be thinking .,okay now im thinking .,why is my room so hot .,sometimes its not hot but right now im boiling .,i think it is because i am nervous about this assignment .,theres no reason to be i just need to type .,well here i am typing .,my room smells funny right now .,joseph bought some cinna sticks from dominoes a while back and i think that they are going bvad .,i know they are going bad .,i need to take out the trash than .,i hate that i get lazy and do n't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob .,great now i propbably sound all anal about mess when im not at all like that .,well im not a messy person but you know .,gosh reading over this i sound like such a pessimist and so boring .,oh well .,time sure is going by pretty slow .,i want to make jell-o but i do n't think i have room in fridge for it .,gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now .,i wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o .,like how does it form the way it does ?,whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o .,one day im going to find out .,more than likely i wo n't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that im gooing to look into it .,it makes me feel productive .,im worried about my financial situation right now .,i still have almost 4000 to pay off and i got a loan for that and all but i do n't know where that money is or who i need to talk to in order to get my hands on it .,tomorrow i guess ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that .,i ca n't think of anything else right now .,i feel like im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am i to say no .,this should be an easy a or at least i hope .,i hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because i said easy a then im going to get like a b or something .,"just in case im sorry even if this seems easy i do my work and i dedicate time so when it comes down to it , i think i deserve that a .",great im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment .,i wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance ?,i doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up .,but then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them .,ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient .,is lenient even a word ?,"oh well anyhow the teacher , her name was ms. ng , she scored perfect on her sat 's .",how the heck did she ever pull that off .,and since she did i have no idea why shes teaching at edison .,in case you dopnt know which you probably do n't edison is a public inner-city school in san antonio and it does not have the best of reputations .,i hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to ?,and that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond edison .,esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from edison .,well thats their loss because im a great person to know and i do n't fit the edison stereotype .,there should be no stereotypes .,they are just not fair .,hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up .,just 35 more seconds .,30 now .,wow this is actually good stress relief i should do this more often when i have time ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"well , my name is robert marshall reinauer jr. i am now thinking about what i am thinking .",i am thinking about physics .,physics is hard because i have never taken a class in it and the first one i am taking is a college course .,another thing i am thinking about is how long these lines are and how much of a page am i really writing .,did you guys set it up this way on purpose to see something or to tell something about us .,"well , if you want to know something that i am feeling right now is that these lines really annoy me by being so long .",that is o. k. cause i will just deal with it .,i am also thinking about my home and what my girlfriend is doing .,if she misses me and other things about her .,i am missing her .,studying here is tough and so are the classes .,but hopefully that will just make me learn more .,there are two girls next to me and they are talking alot .,usually i get people next to me in the computer lab that talk in french and spanish so i do n't know what they are saying and it does not bug me as much .,finally the end of the abnormal typing line .,"well , i can understand what these girls are talking about and i do n't even really care but they are still distracting me from providing a researchable paper .","it really does not annoy me that much but , i like perfect situations and that means everything goes my way .",unfortunately that does not always happen .,guess what they just left .,it is really quiet and i can think lots better .,"well , since i have been in college i have thought about the future more .",does everyone think about the future more in college .,i bet the majority does .,i am really worried about how everything is going to work out after college if there is an after college .,i would like to become a big success and become a great doctor but so would a million other people and i know there is not room for a million other people which narrows the picking for medical school .,i will just do my best and the hope the best comes of it .,nobody knows though what will happen .,this is pretty neat turning in a paper on the computer .,finally another line .,i am going to try to pick up another class because i need more hours .,i hope i can get something that will help me maximize my time here .,my counselors said that i can only take 12 hours which is nice advice but who has to go to school here them or me .,i would like to get out of here as soon as possible .,"not because i do n't like it , but just cause i am eager to see what i will be in the future , a success or a complete failure .","well , 20 minutes is up and i have to confess that i have been correcting my grammatical mistakes just cause i feel better if i do .",i hope you understand .,bye ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,1.416823 -0.584985 0.245489 -1.28826 -1.091041 1.056289 0.768969 0.4801 0.891219 -0.522286 -0.172672 -0.590446 -0.249006 0.556186 0.781984 0.0 -0.04277 -0.055438 0.066153 -0.493667 -0.063144 0.137415 -0.461702 0.408983 -0.624052 0.207216 -0.537836 0.064991 -0.646473 -0.286224 -0.65546 1.175511 -0.612054 -0.379886 -0.302514 0.31621 1.687112 1.555851 1.261094 0.498355 -1.038726 0.869907 -1.445756 -0.374642 -0.616554 0.469801 -0.321043 -0.22144 0.629653 -0.359817 0.56368 -0.952794 -1.209976 1.825997 0.178087 0.09108 -0.418441 -0.954251 0.104115 0.443392 -0.287476 2.978223 0.088816 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.236775 -0.634528 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.337044 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.921345 4.560344 4.201843 4.217781 4.777297 4.070234,66
today was a very long and exhausting day .,"i began by waking up at 8:15 , after only 6 hours of sleep , to go to a 9:00 art history discussion lab at the museum .","it actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep , that way i would n't be as tired as i am right now .","but instead i decided to go ahead and go to class , otherwise i would just fall behind and not know what happend .","personaly , i am not one to really like getting behind , so i think that i made the right decision , granted i may be tired right now , i know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run .","as my day continued , i went to the actual class lecture for art history .","it was somewhat interesting , although i found it a little difficult to consentrate .",i guess that may be because i did not catch up on my reading that i was supposed to have completed by today .,obviously i am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities .,"futhur in the day , i went to the dentist to get a filling , which was not fun !",the right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours .,"that may not sound like too long , but in reality , when your mouth is numb and you ca n't talk well , and you ca n't eat or drink anything because you will spill it , it is a long time .",then i proceeded to go to a meeting .,i had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while i was gone .,this kind of bothered me just because i payed for this computer and i could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers .,i just do n't really think that that is fair .,"then what really irritated me , which does n't happen too ofter , is that when i came back from the meeting , the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor .","my brand new shirts that are not even two days old , my purse , and my shorts , were all on the ground .","now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it , but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it 's place is rude .","i was quite mad , so instead of confronting her , i just left and went to get tcby and to watch tv with my sister .",i guess you could say that i did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off .,"oh well , what 's done is done , but next time i think that i just might have to say something to her ( if i let her use my computer next time ) .","well , that was pretty much my day , and now i am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework , which is making me stressful .","i know that i will be relieved when i finish it all , though .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,1.234983 -0.860577 0.03457 -0.900529 -1.456307 -0.120923 -0.235847 -0.673312 -0.928778 -0.526073 -0.03412 -0.590446 0.080305 0.547394 -0.12617 0.0 -0.04277 -0.188444 -0.157321 -0.795527 -0.380214 1.020499 -0.459817 0.73514 0.057195 -0.479096 1.064231 0.371697 -1.331762 -1.573423 -1.100231 -0.560461 -0.20683 0.14823 -0.301172 -1.109326 -1.084227 -0.374272 -0.812125 -1.259692 1.123265 0.716693 -0.514146 -0.370593 -0.615029 0.473577 -1.093488 -0.718262 0.361825 -0.25412 -1.34699 1.183205 1.918965 -1.123471 1.525958 0.296409 0.951636 0.656937 -0.026474 0.45052 1.095259 -0.835643 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.875738 1.469672 0.295867 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.134645 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.885114 0.703426 -0.067562 -0.313992 4.856168 4.012324 4.464321 4.733126 4.555526,708
i am finally taking a break from doing my math homework .,i am so excited to finally be doing nothing .,"i am so excited that i finally got my laundry back because now i do not have to worry about it , but i do need to do a load of some personal items .",while looking around my room i see my side pretty neat and then i look at my roommate 's side and it is a pig-sty .,"it bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere , when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed .",maybe we will have a talk about that later ?,who knows .,"but i can not wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend , but that 's one more day that i do n't have to go to class .",i love living here at towers but the walls are paper thin .,i can hear anything and everything that my roommate'suitmate say and sometimes that 's okay but when i 'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me .,"oh well , life could be worse .",i wonder what else i have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow ?,"i think i need to go to allie 's room at some point to get her notes from philosophy that i missed last week , and i really need to go return a book to the co-op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check",card with my dad 's name on it .,why would they do such a thing ?,oh well at least it wo n't be too hard to fix .,at least i hope it wo n't be too hard to fix .,i am so tired but i got so much sleep last night and i do n't understand how i 'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today ?,it makes no sense to me .,maybe i am still transforming into the `` college-life-style '' and i 'm just not used to it yet ?,i 'm getting very sleepy but there 's no point in trying to take a nap because i know it wo n't happen for me .,i love how i have so many pictures around my room because everywhere i look i am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home .,"speaking of home , i feel like so many people are going home this weekend .","as much as i would like to go home , i do n't think i 'm quite ready to leave here yet .",i do n't think i 'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already .,even if i did go home my parents would n't be there because they are going to the lake .,i wonder if i will see them at all since they 'll be so close to me now ?,maybe i will call them later and ask .,oh and i need to call mimi back since she left me a message yesterday .,i 'll call her later when i have a few minutes to spare since i know the conversation will last for a lifetime .,or i guess i should say it will last for a long time .,"it 's amazing how i was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate , and then all of a sudden it 's like they both appeared at the same time , and within five minutes they both left and i 'm left alone",again in quietness .,"i will most definitely take advantage of that alone'quiet time , but then again sometimes i do get bored sitting here by myself .","they asked me if i wanted to go eat with them but i just ate a few hours ago , i might as well save my meals for when i 'm actually hungry right ?","wow , looking up at the clock i never realized how long twenty minutes really is .",i feel almost out of breath because i 've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes .,my sister just called but i have to call her back .,she did n't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend jessi would be searching for jessi 's car anyway .,so i wonder what happened to it ?,did she park somewhere and forget where she left it ?,weird .,i hope i never do that .,although it would probably be hard for me to do that since i 've only driven my car twice in two weeks .,i wonder if that 's bad for it ?,maybe i need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works ?,i should probably ask my dad about that .,so its only four oclock in the afternoon and i feel like its ten at night .,why is that ?,well i just hope i keep up with everything as much as i 'm `` supposed '' to because college is definitely not like high school .,high school is like a joke compared to what i 've experienced in only 5 days .,oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks .,so about winter break .,i can not wait to go home because i think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again .,i 'm sure ill see most of my friends over thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the `` old gang '' will probably be christmas break .,"that will be a fun break , and i know it will be great seeing everyone again .",i wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip ?,hmmm there 's another thing i need to check into because i do n't like finding out about things like that at the last minute .,especially since my best friend who lives in virginia will be in houston for part of the break .,if i missed her because i was on a family trip i would be extremely upset so i need to figure it out to make sure i will be around .,wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe i should go get some coffee from downstairs ?,sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it 's kind of of sore .,i think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather .,i ca n't wait to fully recooperate so i can feel 100 % again .,then hopefully i will be in a better mood and not so irritable ?,hopefully !,"well now getting back to the matter at hand , this assignment .","although it has been time consuming , it 's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life .",wow and that 's saying a lot !,"i am so interested to see what our next assignment is like , since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again .",our class is huge and i actually saw a second person that i know yesterday when i was walking out .,speaking of i should probably call that friend of mine .,well it looks to me that i just glanced up and this assignment is over !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i am sitting in my room at my apartment on 1000 w. 25th street .,"the apartments are called the chelsea , and i live with two other people in the apartment number 208. i have been stressing all day about when i was going to find the time to do my psychology writing assignment .",i honestly feel like i have not had time in the past 6 days to even sit down for twenty minutes just to type out a stream of my thoughts .,this is a pretty neat assignment .,i am thinking about how i missed my metals class last thursday from eight o'clock in the morning until noon .,"since i missed the lab , i have to go in this friday from like eleven until my two o'clock government section .",right now i am so tired i can hardly even think about my day on friday .,i am also thinking about what i am going to do tonight .,"i was n't really planning on going out , but one of my friends in my government class today asked me if i was going to go with her , so i ended up having to go because i would have felt bad saying no to her .",what about the pre-testing i am going to do after this writing assignment ?,i hope it is not hard because i think my brain will just about break down .,i really like psychology .,"i was talking to my dad about it on the phone yesterday , and i was asking him how i wondered why i never took a psychology class before .","my high school offered psychology classes , i just never thought to take them .","i took sociology instead , and i actually did n't even like it very much which is weird because i ended up taking it once again before psychology in college .",i was actually thinking about my schedule for next semester .,"it is crazy , but i am actually already stressed about things for next year , like where i 'm going to live , what classes i am going to take , make sure i live somewhere close to a bus stop .","my bedroom is up the stairs in my apartment , it is pretty cool because me and one of my best friends live upstairs , and my other best friend lives downstairs .","it is so cool because we have a great location , i mean , we are close to anything there is fun to do on west campus .","we can walk almost to any fraternity party , and to other of our friends ' apartments who live around us .","i ride the bus to class everyday , even though i could walk if i wanted too , but of course i do n't .","plus , all of my classes are at the art building , and the west campus bus takes you directly from almost the front of my apartment complex to the front doors of the art building .",three out of four of my classes are in the art building .,it is kind of weird because only two of my classes actually involve art .,"two dimensional design and beginning metals i. my government class is also in the art building , and i think it is because that is one of the few buildings on campus with an auditorium in it .","i get really sick of being in the art building , even though i run into the same people almost everyday and i know where just about any classroom is .","i almost changed my major as a matter of fact , just because i was so incredibly sick of the whole art scene .","but , i thought about it for a while , and i realized that designing jewelry is what i truly want to make a career out of .","it is really frustrating though , because all of the art classes are four hours long , twice a week , and i only get three hours of credit for them !",it is crazy !,"i was going to actually apply to get into the design school , other than just studio w'minor in metals , but i went to the seminar for design and it is totally not what i had in mind .","they do things like design posters , building , add things to computers in clip0-art and such and use things like digital cameras .",we had to use digital cameras in my two dimensional design class yesterday and it was pretty cool .,although i had no idea to what my teacher 's motives were behind the assignment i actually had fun .,she paired me up with someone in my class that i do n't think i ever talked to until yesterday .,we walked from the art building to the tower twice !,"well , actually , we walked their twice because the camera we checked out said we could take 139 pictures .","yet , after only taking five , the camera said our memory card was full .","it made me so mad , but it was okay in the end because we ended up getting our assignment done on time .",i keep glancing up at the timer on the top of my screen i think almost every time i finish a sentence .,"i actually like this exercise because , even though i am timed , i actually am making some good points to myself .","it is so weird how writers find themselves writing their best work , when they are not even meaning to or realizing they are doing it at all .","i am definitely not saying this is one of my best writings , but i just remembered somebody telling me that a long time ago .",i wonder what i will be doing after i finish writing this .,right now i keep stopping every five seconds and checking the timer to see how much time has gone by .,i am really hungry .,i have not eaten anything since i think around 1030 this morning .,"i definitely should have grabbed something to eat before i started righting this , but oh well .",what will i have for dinner ?,hmm .,i have no clue .,"i think after this , i will go ask one of my roommates to see if she can fix my computer because the aol does n't work for somer reason .","we just got our internet connection today , which is another reason why i am just now doing this assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"how to begin , i have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now i 'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why i feel this is a strange assignment o well i do n't smell",much right now but i hear the tv which i fixed last night i did a pretty good job even though i still have an extra screw left i 'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which i hate its 3 11 tonight,i 'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum i 'm glad i get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow i 'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the,competition will become harder the band is a neat experience i have always liked marching and now i get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun i have only been typing for 3 minutes this is going to be a long 20 minutes,"there is nothing i can do to make it go by quicker even if i type slower , no i 'm trying to find something else to think about , so i am disrupting my stream which is ironic that i have not really because i 'm on a new",one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end .,until now .,so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so i can start my weekend and maybe get some food i 'm very hungry now i have not eaten all day and i 'm hungry now i need to get some food,", maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely

being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that ca n't stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways i have been trying to help people understand that christ came to give love,and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live i guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what i believe is imposing my culture on them which i guess could be true but i 'm not trying to break them,from their traditions i 'm just trying to .,"my roommate just started talking , `` arafat refuses to leave , and the usa is blatantly pro-israel .","``

because i am so focused on how hungry i am and what i would like to eat yet i 'm thinking about thinking about what i want to eat and so forth .,this assignment is very weird because you ca n't have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think,"about it the point is gone , the twilight zone is on now i love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 12 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues","of the time in them which is very good , i like them , i have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert

why they set the thermostat so low .,here it is in the summer and i 'm sitting in my room with sweet pants and a long sleeve shirt on .,i normally have on a sweater .,"you know , i wonder what everyone else will be typing about .","i decided not to worry about capitalizing my words because the instructions stated to not worry about grammar or sentence structure , which is great because i 'm not that good with grammar and sentence structure .",i wish we did n't have to type for 20 minutes .,i have been going for 13 minutes now .,i hope that the next seven minutes go by fast .,"to whoever is reading this , how many have you read ?",i wonder if there are any interesting .,i think that psychology could be interesting .,i just do n't like some professors .,"for example , in my exercise physiology class i have this proff that just kills the class .","not literally , but it is a very interesting class and i have trouble staying awake .",i wonder if i chose the right major .,"i mean i like physical therapy and all , but i think that i would rather be working with cancer patients .",i wonder what people are writing on this thing .,i wonder if someone is treating it like their own personal diary .,i have four minutes now .,after these four minutes are up i 'm going swimming .,"no not really , i have to do homework .",i have a big concert to go to tomorrow and i 'm trying to finish all my studies .,you know i use to never use the word studies but for some reason it just came to my head .,"i like to write papers like these , no grammar , no structure just typing .",i like to type i can type over 70 wpm .,i 'm currently looking for a job .,"and so if the person reading this knows of any available positions that i might be good for , you just let me know .",i have one more minute left and i plan on finishing at the time i am suppose to .,i bet that some people do n't type for twenty minutes .,i could have typed for 10 minutes for all you know .,for some reason at the beginning of this assignment i was thinking about things to type but not any more .,obviously .,well my time is up .,peace out ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

mommy says i have lots of wrinkles under my feet .,she says that means you keep everything to yourself .,it 's true for me .,i do n't know about others though .,i think that 's a cool but weird saying

i am residing at castillian for my freshman year .,"i have my own personal room , which is more than i can say for others .",it is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home .,the entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills .,"all the lights can be seen twinkling , which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax .",my parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things i 'd like to do .,"they try so hard to make me happy , but i 'm not .",i feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college .,i also believe that this was their full intention .,we 'll call it a bribe .,they spit out money as long as i do well .,"this should n't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me , and i myself would like to succeed as best i can .","the bribe , however , is the problem .","i 'm cracking , although that term does n't quite seem to fit my feelings .",dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description .,everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away .,your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain .,"you can always try and get out , but since you are dissolving , everything you aim for slips through your fingertips .",i have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects .,i go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book .,"when it actually comes to turning something in , however , minute mistakes always seem to add up .","already after the first day of class , i have messed up terribly on homework .",i am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment ( though it 's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything ) made me more miserable .,"in fact , it actually brought me to tears .",an assignment that means nothing to anyone ( except obviously me ) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears .,i see myself as pathetic because i failed myself and because i can crack so easily .,"i ca n't say that my classes are overwhelming , though they take up from 9 7 with a one hour lunch break each day .","if i had to guess , i would say that i was unsure of everything .","i 'm unsure of friends , family , boyfriend , classes , grades , time , money , and so much more .","on top of this , i 'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once .",i 'm sure it will all level out in the end and that i 'll eventually get the swing of things .,"as of now , however , i feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things .",i only wish i was n't born with the disease of being manic depressive ( and that my grandmother in france had n't died last week ) .,it only seems to complicate things .,"also , as we said in class , stress can bring about depression and visaversa .",perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions .,all i know is that it seems so much right now ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,1.29673 -1.649448 -0.26202 -1.456572 -1.479088 0.410206 1.493538 0.887115 0.926463 -0.37082 -0.138832 -0.590446 1.032691 -0.135892 1.60354 0.0 -0.04277 -0.477163 -0.521214 -0.233878 -0.612903 1.440229 -0.882098 -0.345646 -0.624052 0.866914 2.300447 0.132283 0.187251 -0.624425 -0.686454 -0.622634 0.972171 2.030835 -0.685165 2.427196 -1.475071 -0.489556 -1.28492 -1.649092 0.299649 -0.724294 1.679056 0.880609 0.083119 0.32956 1.062361 -0.385802 -0.046805 -0.085218 -1.050737 -0.491747 -0.42646 -0.566253 -0.951481 -0.130782 -0.219973 -0.954251 0.586269 0.037258 -0.658848 2.304231 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.129215 0.927638 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.208171 2.765871 0.541743 0.168817 4.594039 4.124621 4.38982 4.811302 5.228321,1496

so today i went to class and i am really really tired i do n't know why because in high school i was never this tired and i never slept that much during the day now i sleep a lot more i have breaks in between my classes and i,"do n't like it because i do n't do anything useful during those breaks i either eat , sleep , watch my suitemates tv or sit and stare at the wall , i think that i have a obessive compulsive shopping disorder because i always want to shop i like",to shop and i always spend too much money i have the money from my parents but i should learn to save it but they did give it to me for clothes but i still shouldnt shop that much well oh well i like it so i do it i,really like my dorm i want to decorate the living room more but my roommate and my room is cute and everyone says that it is homely i hung up all my picutes the other day and i like it alot i really like my stuff i think it is,extremely cute it looks like a model dorm room it should because it took me forever to pick out what to buy and i got frames for all my pictures to match and my mom is making me a lamp to match it is going to be awesome well now,my boyfriend is going to come over and we are going to watch a movie that should be fun oh i forgot that are suitemates are having movie night oh well we can just watch it with them i never get pimples but i have a really huge one right,now and it is aggrevating me to death i guess that i am really concerned with my physical appearance but i ca n't help it anyways i do n't know what else to write umh the elevators at dobie are extremely annoying because they take forever and i always have,to take the stairs from the 12 floor i hate it but i never take them up maybe i should to work off calories oh that reminds me i really need to start working out again i have slacked off since summer school ended and fall started i should start,running again too i could go with my friend i will give her a call later well something is wrong with my labtop because any time i type too fast it stops and sends me to the upper portion of the page i hate it then i have to use,the mouse to get back down to start typing again i think that i am a true perfectionist it even shows in this writing assignment because anytime i spell a word wrong i have to go back and retype it the right way i wonder why i do that oh,i miss my car because i put it in the shop yesterday and i ca n't get it until tomorrow it is no big deal i do n't drive it that much down here anyway but i just like to know that i can drive when i want to it,is going to cost like 270 dollars to get the oil changed and the brake pads changed and the rotars grinded down they also had to give me a new ignition for something because of a recall i have a 98 honda accord ( it is so nice i love,my car fully loaded and everything all the extras ) and they recalled the ignition because it can just stall out when you are driving that is scary my stepmom called me and was worried because if i was driving on the freeway and it stalled it would not be,"good i said hey if someone hit me and maybe i would just get hurt enough so that i could sue honda and get enough money to pay for college and be able to drive my bmw and go on shopping sprees with my sisters , and mothers and all",the time that would be nice so i havent talked to my sister in awhile she is very sick not sick in a flu way but in a internal way like the brain and heart i love her so much and i am going to call her as soon as,i am done with this so that i can tell her how much i love her and when i go home

"i 'm hungry , but i do n't have any of the food i normally eat .","if i had a car , i 'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more myoplex ( protein shakes ) and some cereal and some milk , but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove","their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such , so they would n't let me bring my car this semester .","if i had gone to school out of state , like both my brother and sister did before me , i would n't be getting a car for the entire first year , but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was , and i have","some scholarships on top of that , my parents are considering letting me bring my car to austin at semester .","i really do n't know where there 's room to park a ford expedition in this town , but i 'll find some place .","my car would have been nice to have last last sunday morning , because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse , which is too far to walk to , and i ended up not being able to go because i could n't find a ride .","i was pretty upset , but my r. a. danny , the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team , told me to go to practice this morning anyway , and the coaches would n't mind .",he was right .,"i just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that i was n't able to attend , went through the workout , and they told me to come back on wednesday .","it was a lot tougher than i would have thought , in some respects , but a lot less strenuous in others , when i look back at it .","the one mile jog was n't hard at all , and neither were the pull-ups , but eventually the sit-ups wore me out , and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets .","i think that 's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before , which was a bad move on my part , but it 's hard to say .","i 've never done jump-squats before , so i might have felt sick afterwards without being sore .","we did n't get to go out on the water , which was somewhat disappointing , but the group of guys i was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday , while the other groups run body circuits , since that 's all our group was able",to do .,"we did actually take a boat down to the dock , and set it in the water , but i was n't able to get in , and the boat never left the dock , so it was n't as much fun as it could have been .",i 'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session .,"we get to use the rowing machines for the first time , and i 've never used one before .","i 'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze , or if i 'm really going to throw up this time .","i work out 6 days a week , and i run , and most of my workouts are repetition , not heavy lifting , so i could definitely be in worse shape for rowing , but i 'm still not sure how far away i am from the kind of",endurance i need for the urgs '' ( rowing machines .,") i would actually be stronger , but have less endurance if my shoulder had n't been giving me problems all through high school .",i pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the new york airport after a two week cruise through southern europe .,"we went to the doctor , they told me to lay off it , and i did , but apparently it was n't long enough .","i was too anxious to get back in the gym , and i never let it heal completely , so about six months later i hurt it again .","six months after that , when it happened the third time , my parents took me to a doctor , and eventually to physical therapy .","the therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals , triceps , biceps , and deltoids .","apparently i had n't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body , which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements , where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder .","the doctor was amazed that both shoulders had n't been more severely damaged , but i was told that i was n't beyond repair .","a full month of therapy , very specific exercises , cross-friction massages , and ice massages helped a lot , but my shoulder is still pretty fragile .","if i push myself too hard on the bench press , or if i do n't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout , it 's sore for the next few days .","i 'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back , especially the scapular region , so i can push myself harder at the gym when i 'm training the rest of my upper body .","the pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that i can feel had been neglected , because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups .","apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work , so i 'm happy with the training so far .","i was actually worried for a while that i would n't be able to train the rest of my body if i got serious rowing , but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps , so the rest of your","body will need developing too , like your chest and triceps .","this means i can still go to the gym , and i actually have more reason now than ever , because i have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that i will undoubtedly be developing .","running and jump-squats in training wo n't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout i want , but i 'm not sure when i 'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day .","i suppose that after a few weeks of real practice , assuming i make the team , i 'll be able to decide when to work my legs , and how hard .","some of the guys there seemed to have been working out , or playing football in high school , because they were pretty used to running body-circuits , and jogging , and were n't too beat at the end of the day .",some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness .,"a few people vomited , one guy passed out , and i heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing .","i 'm not sure exactly what was going on there , but i 'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet .","i ca n't wait for it to get cold outside , so i can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse .",it was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator .,"once it gets colder , i 'm sure i 'll have to buy a sweatshirt , and some warmer gym shorts , but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse .","it 'll be a lot colder if i fall in the water too , but i 'm hoping that wo n't happen too often .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

that i feel right now .","i think i should give that a try , and maybe start a rigorous exercise program so that i will be more tired at night , which might make me get some more rest and increase my appetite a little bit .",maybe i should try to get out of this building .,"it seems very cold and uninviting , and i think another place might be better for me .","well , i know that with my faith in

today is 911 and it has been a whole year since the tragedy last year .,i remember that day being in first period and hearing of a plane flying into the tower .,"obviously , that was all the people at school talked about that day , and the shock was great .",it surprised me so much that my teachers did n't take out time from classwork to talk about the event .,this is the biggest most memorable event of our lives and i thought it deserved more .,so much more than just the acknowledgement .,"yeah , the principal came on , but it did n't seem like enought .",i would have liked to discuss it with my class .,"actually , yesterday in my rhetoric class this guy in my class made this annoying comment that he thinks the president took advantage of what happened on 911 to ask the nation for volunteers .","i was outraged at what he said , how can you be so stupid ( to put it bluntly ) .",that is n't very nice for me to think but our nation is in a time of need and this past year was a very unique time .,the president totally has the right to ask for volunteers and was in no way taking advantage of 911. it bothers me when people speak about that things when they should take more time to think about what they 're really saying .,"yeah , so anyways .","911 , everytime i hear one of those songs about the event it gives me chills up and down my body , the chills are uncontrolable and it makes me feel good though that it happens .",i always get chills when i really really enjoy or care mostly about what i 'm seeing or hearing .,that is so interesting how the body works that way .,i do n't think about getting chills but they just start running up and down my body .,"although , i get chills i do n't usually cry .","i 'm not a very emotional person , but all depends on what 's going on around me .","lately i have been pretty stressed out from the this huge change in living , change in schedule .","and , i can cry easier probably because i 've been so stressed .","i find time to take it away , like when i run , i am not stressed .",i could think about all i have to do while i 'm running but the thing is i 'm not stressed while i 'm running because i know i need to run and i ca n't study while i run so it does n't stress me out .,does that make any sense in the way i wrote it .,"in other words , if i was watching tv , and i know i have to study , then i would be stressed because i know i could be studying instead of watching tv .",i am very good at managing my time so i know that i will be able to accustom myself and get used to my schedule better .,i 've just been so used to my routine at home that it is hard to change here .,"what does n't help me very much is that i have late classes , no earlier than 11a .",m. and the other three days are at 1pm .,"therefore , i usually sleep until classes where if i had 9 or 10 am classes i would be up earlier and more time to study during the day .",i like to get my homework and what i need to get done out of the way .,i do n't usually find myself as a procrastinator .,i 've definitely learned my conservative ways from my father and probably picked up most of those traits from him .,although i 'm not as simplistic as he is .,everything to him is simple .,simple .,period .,it bugs me sometimes how simple everything has to be but i 've picked up on some of those things because i see myself doing the same things he does .,and it bothers me when people are too loose .,"i like to clean , organized , in order and when people i know are late and too loose about what they do it irritates me .","yes

i should have done this assingment sooner .,it is a different type of assignment from ones i usually get .,it is hard to write out what i am thinking about .,"i ca n't seem to put my thoughts into words , or maybe i can but i just do n't want to tell anyone about somethings that i think about , especially someone i do n't really know .",i think that is the reason i put off this assignment for so long .,i did n't know if i wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment .,i do n't know if i thought i would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if i just wanted to keep them secret .,not that any of them would be embarrassing .,i think that i mostly just did n't want to have to write them down .,"it does n't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult , but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank , or you try to think of something interesting to think about .",i was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if i would actually get off at nine .,i also thought about an internet friend from kansas who i have n't talked to in a while .,but i did n't think those were too interesting to write about so i began to think about other things .,it is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you ca n't think of anything .,"just the other day , i was trying to write a philosophy paper and i thought i would be able to write it very easily .",but when i actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult .,i knew what i wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment .,i became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause i could n't expand my thoughts .,i believe that i could have written a beautiful paper but at the times i sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and i could n't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense .,"i htink that i have this problem often , but usually i can overcome my `` writer 's block '' simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later .",i think that is another reason i put this assignment off for so long .,i made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have `` writer 's block. `` i seemed to not be thinking about anything so i could n't just put my thoughts down .,"i was also worried about writing about the right things , but i realized it does n't mater what i write about , it is just supposed to be what i am thinking .",these twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and i feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more .,i have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that i do n't have to think too much about them .,i just need to write and not worry about how `` stupid '' i think they sound ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.615178 -1.199226 -0.136349 -1.830578 -1.086389 0.497101 0.844451 -0.289373 0.828962 -0.397327 -0.053019 -0.590446 -1.145222 0.168952 0.548954 0.0 -0.04277 0.474415 0.613213 -0.795527 0.432758 1.190982 -0.874888 -0.629825 -0.624052 -1.426776 2.311849 -0.426617 -1.715594 -1.639814 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.693908 0.085012 -0.344153 -0.661803 3.527228 -0.471053 4.774705 1.225737 0.316172 1.860051 -1.190239 -1.313428 -1.429535 -0.279101 -0.366 -1.099155 -0.281028 -0.546048 -1.34699 -1.460108 1.309283 0.162435 0.068752 -0.656421 -1.481382 5.861329 -0.26708 0.508522 -0.902413 0.555812 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.719234 -0.677018 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 2.070195 0.128112 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.775797 4.640978 4.017488 4.714542 4.458251 4.802192,945

right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine,with me .,i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week .,"i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a , little more hard core than its been .",i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something .,this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i do n't know what is so weird about it .,i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy 's which is good but its not what i wanted .,when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in,it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw .,i do n't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it .,you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way .,now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something .,i think my cd is over now .,no its not .,i do n't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying .,oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd .,my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one .,maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one .,i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something .,oh well she can live .,im really tired and its only like 9:45. probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning .,this song is definitely the best on this cd .,i love dave matthews- i 've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome .,ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then .,that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there .,not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway .,it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener .,i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random .,is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything ?,i do n't think so- so oh well .,my knee hurts .,i think i should ice it or soemthing but i do n't have an ice pack .,i guess ill have to get that sometime .,an ice pack and sweet tea .,if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later .,this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea .,you ca n't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp,be nasty .,i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria ?,i guess it doesnt matter .,i miss the italian food from up there so much .,i ca n't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there .,not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time ?,i need more pasta .,penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created .,i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something .,you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here .,or maybe its just me .,i doubt it .,ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in .,hmm .,im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something .,haha how funny would that be ?,and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"well , i suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise i will just say whatever is on my mind , which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was .","but , let 's back up and get the basics down .","for graduation , my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer .","new , being the operative word .",so they told me to go find one that i liked and tell them where it was .,my mother and i went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $ 1500 .,"we thought that sounded reasonable , so we informed my grandparents of the computer 's location and they said it sounded good .","however , they went to see my uncle 's family in dallas for my cousin 's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer .",so i ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me .,my dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized,because i can not get online .,"so i spent saturday messing with my computer , trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem .",it was n't .,"my uncle drove in from dallas on sunday and took windows off , reinstalled it , deleted my c drive ( which is a big deal ) , then created a new one and repartitioned it , everything seemed to work for a brief period of time before my computer",decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down .,now i am stuck with a computer that does n't even partially compute and my dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called `` computer doctor '' and meanwhile he 's still ranting about how he was right all along and my mother should,"talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer , and if they do n't how my parents should because if they do n't i 'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays , etc .",so i wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when i could have been in the music room practicing .,"and i 'm a music major , not computer science , so the music building is where i should be .",but my mother would n't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer .,"so i did n't practice at all this weekend when my professor says i should practice 4 hours a day at least , and i just got a bunch of new music and now i 'm totally screwed for my lesson on friday .","i also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is , and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night , and since we have the class everyday , it 's",not like we can procrastinate at all .,it 's very frustrating .,or maybe it 's just me .,i do n't know .,all i know is that i have n't even typed for ten minutes yet and i 'm still complaining .,it 's not like i usually procrastinate about anything anyway .,"i mean , i was valedictorian of my high school , i think i know something about time management .","although , being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat .","i went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts , and had the highest number of `` unexcused absences '' you could have without being held back .",and i wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation .,so i guess i know a little about procrastination anyway .,but i had a reason for waiting that long really !,"when it was certain that i was going to be valedictorian , everybody started giving me tips , like they knew what they were talking about .","`` do n't make it too long , i 'll pay you five dollars to say my name , do n't make it too boring .",i do n't want to sit through some damn boring speech. `` even friends ' parents were giving me tips .,"everybody wanted to know what i was going to say , so i just did n't even try to come up with anything until the last minute , so i would n't have anything to tell them .",most people like me speech i guess .,i worked in a favorite quote of mine by theodore roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try .,"it 's a really encouraging quote , and i always used to repeat it to myself when i went to violin auditions because i am an extremely nervous performer .",i also used to repeat that thing from dune by frank herbert that the main character paul used to say `` i will not fear .,fear is the mind killer .,fear is the little death that brings total obliteration .,"i will face my fear. `` etc , etc .",it always sort of helped me get a grip on myself i guess which i need because i 'm a very insecure person .,and i 'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because i have to use her computer and she 's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed .,"it 's only 12:34 though , and she always goes to sleep around midnight which i think is weird .","but then i 'm an insomniac and i can never sleep anyway , so i 'm usually up until about three .",i also am a coffee addict .,have been since the age of seven .,"i think it usually surprises people that i 've been drinking coffee so long , but my dad used to drink at least a pot a day , to that was a drink that was always available .","you 'd think it would have stunted my growth , but i 'm 5 ' 7 '' .","then again , my brother is only 15 and he 's 5 ' 9 '' , so maybe i would have been taller .",maybe not .,i sort of like my height .,"hmm , i 've got two minutes to go , and i lost my train of thought , so i guess i 'll just keep typing until something comes to me .","oh , i 'm listening to the soundtrack from `` schindler 's list '' right now .",i totally love that movie and the music makes me cry .,"music always makes me emotional , but this cd is played by itzhak perlman whom i personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world , although joshua bell , who did the soundtrack for the `` red violin '' is also really good , but younger so he does",n't have as much experience .,i 'm sure he will be so much better when he 's older though .,"well , it 's been twenty minutes .",it was interesting .,a little personal odyssey of the mind there .,bye !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

as i look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 12:26am on september 11. i am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago .,they still should strike a painful memory in every americans life .,i remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment .,i also feel a little stress with all of the homework that college brings along with it .,"austin is so much different than my hometown of lubbock , and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it .","however , i have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far .",i can not wait to say that i am a graduate of the university of texas .,"that will mean so much to me and my family , since it will be an amazing accomplishment .","i just remembered that my laundry basket is full , and i need to do that sometime before friday since i may be leaving town for a pat green concert .","hopefully , the laundry room at the end of my floor , 6th in jester west , will not be full .",surely i can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that i did not complete .,i sure hope i can adjust to college as well as i have set my goals .,"my roommates are out of the room right now , and i am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here .","they are both from lubbock also , and i have been friends with them for about 6 years .",my parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much i appreciate them paying for me to come down here .,"i know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence , but me and them know it is for the best .",i am convinced that the business program at ut will set me up for a very successful life .,"my hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously , and my eyes are starting to close .","i feel like falling asleep , but i know how much work i still have left to do .","for some reason , i get most of my work done around or after midnight .",it helps that i do n't have a class until 10 on mwf and 12 on tth .,i am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church .,it is important to me to find a church in austin and not forget the ways from which i was raised .,"many people believe ut is so liberal that every student comes out weird , but i believe there is something for everyone in austin .","i have already met so many people just like me , and it is awesome .",by far i can tell that college will be the best time of my life .,the only thing i wish i could change is the dorm food .,i am getting so tired of chicken every meal .,i do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken .,"well the saying goes , everything tastes like chicken anyways .",maybe next year i can get an apartment with some of the new people that i meet and possibly the guys from lubbock too .,i am trying to figure out why my email is not working .,it keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying .,"oh well , two more days to the weekend .",arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game .,i saw some of the football players today .,"wow , they are so huge .",they are like a different breed of people .,i want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big .,i know it is some sort of phenomenon or something .,i figured out that in 2 minutes i have to find something new to do so i am already brainstorming .,i wish every paper was this easy .,english papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind .,it could go on forever .,i never have to stop and think .,dell : what an amazing company .,how does someone without a college

an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he","was writing and in affect , she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that was n't pre-planned .",i told her that that was not `` stream-of consciousness '' because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story .,then she just got irritated and told me that i do n't do that to her .,"and i was like , `` what ?",'' .,she does n't make any sense .,oh dear .,surat is screaming her head off and i have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight .,it is 10:30 and she usually starts screaming about now .,"surat is a nice bird though , other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood .",she usually keeps herself pretty entertained .,there she goes again .,i should tell monica to cover her .,moni is probably busy with her studies .,how am i supposed to tend to my bird while i am doing this assignment ?,i have to stay here and complete it or then i would n't really be doing the assignment right .,that brings up another point .,what is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 20 minutes .,are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment ?,would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break ?,"ok , i had to go cover the cage but it did n't take more than five seconds ( literally ) because the cage is on the other side of the room that i am in .",that is a relief .,now she is n't screaming .,now what should i write about .,hmmm .,i had a yoga class today .,ashtanga yoga .,it was very difficult to do and very fun .,i hope to become really flexible this semester .,i also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester .,i got a texercise pass from gregory gym for 55 dollars and i have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes .,it is wonderful .,i just wish i did n't have this psychology class at 3:30 to 5pm because two really good classes go on at that time .,it is really disappointing .,i ca n't believe i am taking a psychology class ( 301 ) this late into my undergrad .,i am a senior and i am just taking this class because i decided just recently i want to go into counseling psychology .,and in order to do that i need 4 psychology classes with a `` b '' or higher .,i am going to make an a in this class .,this summer had a large effect on me .,i realized that i really did n't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family .,i think i just spelled that `` adequate '' word incorrectly .,i hope this assignment is n't going to be graded on spelling .,that would be ridiculous because this is a `` stream of consciousness '' paper .,what if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly .,this page does n't have a spell checker .,people are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing .,have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing ?,my sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers .,that seems so ancient now and that was only about 11 or 12 years ago .,its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years .,what is going to happen next ?,i will tell what will happen next .,we will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left .,the earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise .,i think they should study that in psychology .,why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings ?,we are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources .,we are causing a great imbalance in nature .,would they even be able to study that in psychology ?,that might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they do n't want to admit how ridiculous humans are .,"or rather , can be .",i really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology .,or at least i have more experience in those other two areas .,i tend to take the middle ground however .,i am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and i am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment .,i think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist .,am i going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology ?,i hope not .,"psychology is a good field , do n't get me wrong , but one has to remember that everything has its faults .",i took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments .,some of the questions were funny to me .,i think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica .,haha .,my 20 minutes are over .,guess you do n't get to read about my opinions on erotica ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

when i came to texas i thought that school was going to be very difficult and that i would not meet anyone new .,these are both wrong .,so far i have met many new people and i feel as if school is not going to be as hard as i had expected .,i love my classes and the diversity of students in them .,"diversity to some people is a bad thing , but i love it .",i think it is great to any environment to have people from every different ethnic or religious background .,"my favorite band , the dave matthews band , has a lead singer named dave matthews .","he is from south africa , although he is caucasian , he considers himself to be of a south african background .",he sings many songs that talk about the problems with diversity in the world today and in years before .,he is a great man and i love his songs .,i went to the concert in houston last night and watched the people around .,everyone seems to love him .,i feel that he is my inspiration .,his songs have such meaning and i feel that every song that he sings relates to me in some way .,during the concert he was so moved by his music that he would dance and play around on stage .,he is such an entertainer and performer that it would be impossible for anyone not to like him or his band .,each person on the band has a unique talent .,"boyd tinsley is the violinist , and can play jams for hours at a time .",he is very talented and used to have a band of his own before he joined the dave matthews band .,leroi moore is the wind instrument player .,"i can not really specify what instrument he plays because he plays over 12 different instruments , and all of which he plays to perfection .",during concerts he must where sunglasses because he is so shy that he closes his eyes during the entire time of which he is playing .,carter beauford is the drummer .,"he is probably the most talented member of the band , besides dave of course .",recently he was ranked the number one drummer in the world .,another member of the band is stefan lessard .,he plays the bass guitar for the band .,he joined the band in his junior year of high school .,he is the youngest member of the band .,"finally , dave matthews plays lead acoustic guitar for the band .",he is probably one of the most talented songwriters in the world today .,the band last year had the highest profit grossing summer tour which made over 60 million dollars .,before dave started the band he used to bartend at a local bar in virginia called miller 's .,this is important because he met all the members of the band bartending at that bar .,he ended up starting the band in 1991 and did n't get all the members to actually commit until 1992. every year the band becomes more popular and more popular .,"but , the initial reason why the band became so popular in the very beginning was because the band allowed fans to plug into the soundboard and create tapes .","these tapes where then copied and passed onto many other people , and through this very system of tape trading the band 's popularity grew at exponential rates .","nowadays , people can just use napster to trade songs , but back in the early nineties people actually had to trade the tapes in person or through the mail .",this band is my inspiration and i hope that they will live forever in my mind and in the mind of the people who hears their music ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.708017 0.202759 -0.857781 0.305499 -1.063454 -0.070828 1.972994 3.730432 3.359137 -0.204208 -0.139826 -0.590446 0.104197 0.2092 1.605025 0.0 -0.04277 -1.874043 -2.850334 -0.795527 -3.221553 -0.742368 2.98179 -0.729722 -0.624052 3.202828 0.408692 0.051704 0.527118 1.77554 0.437038 0.070531 -1.15043 -0.4514 -1.017959 -1.109326 -1.905105 -0.317861 -1.372441 -1.159544 -1.038726 -1.010574 0.075039 -0.854546 -0.727057 -0.383375 -0.092309 2.607631 -0.172876 2.002369 1.679783 0.233745 0.127216 -1.101965 -0.54103 -0.341659 0.233915 -0.954251 0.614958 -0.860889 -0.750058 -0.940791 0.011479 1.491718 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.119931 -0.339496 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.382963 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.026226 4.336646 3.606684 4.78341 4.653487 4.829157,1306

this is my first writing assignment of college .,it does n't seem like it could be so bad .,"in fact , college itself is n't so bad yet .",its not like i have any homework that is assigned .,all my friends have homework constatnly that is due for them to turn in .,glad i am not in that situation .,i guess that i am behind in schoolwork though .,i need to read so many chapters in so many books .,but who wants to read when i could be going out .,the freedom here is wonderful .,i do n't think i have stayed out this late so many days in a row ever .,it 's amazing to me how much fun something as stupid sounding as an 80 's theme fraternity party could be .,fraternity parties are the best thing here i think .,"free alcohol , no way to get caught under 21 ( unless you are stupid ) , and guys everywhere .","of course , i have already skipped class because of hangovers .",or can you really call them hangovers if you are still intoxicated .,i am not sure about that one .,i have already met so many guys .,i wish that i was n't the way i am about guys .,i wish i could just meet them and enjoy our time and then thats it .,"no , there is always one that i seem to get attatched to .",i do n't want to like anyone though .,i am having to fight my usual ways to keep from liking just this one guy .,i promised myself i would n't fall for someone for at least a year .,i am sick and tired of being controlled by men .,boyfriends are always controlling and now that i do n't want a boyfriend i am still being controlled by having to fight feelings of attatchment .,do n't they say that you seek people similar to your father subconsciously ?,that would make sense i suppose .,he is controlling too .,not in a bad way- or in an abusive way .,i suppose i would call it more of a traditional way .,"he is the head of the household , the king , and its normally his way or the highway .",even though i always got the last word when i lived at home .,that got me in more trouble sometimes than what we were fighting about .,"oh well , now we are perfect .",i have always been daddy 's little girl and now he misses me to much to pick fights with me .,i miss him too though .,i call him almost every day at home or at work .,i do n't really miss my mom though .,"she is still bitter about my pledging achio , rather than her precious adpi .","i 'm a triple legacy , why would i want to go anywhere else ?","i will tell you why , because those girls are not for me !",i miss my dog most of all .,my mollie girl is so sad without me according to my sister .,"she said she does n't play anymore , she wo n't lay on anyones lap- which she used to do all the time- and she just seems sad .",i always knew i was her favorite .,i hope i am writing about what i am supposed to be .,the assignment did say to write what you were thinking about .,and as i started writing all of this is just coming out of my head .,the best thing about this assignment is that it seems to go by fast .,i suppose i have a lot of things on my mind .,there are a lot of things i would like to settle so they could be out of my mind .,like the money issue .,i am so sick of money .,i just balanced my checkbook and i do n't have any .,and basically that sucks .,"when all my friends just whip out daddy 's credit card for plane tickets to l. a. for the weekend and 1000 dollar tv 's for their dorm , and a new outfit for every party or event , and good food at good restaurants , and basically everything else-",it sucks to not be able to do that .,"my parents support me and i am very grateful for what i get , but the other way would be nice too .",i respect my parents for how hard they work to support me .,they do n't want me to work and i know that i am expensive .,"college tuition , living'eating expenses , sorority dues , car payment , insurance , and everything else they pay for gets expensive .",i just wish i could do more .,i guess i am selfish for not getting a job even if they do n't want me too .,"i say i want to help , but if i worked i would hate it and i would complain , and i would just want to go out all the time .","i hope that grammer and punctuation , etc .",does n't count in this paper .,i hate capitalizing i when i type fast .,i am almost done .,done !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

hello .,"my name is neha shah , and i 'm a freshman this year .",so far i love ut and i 'm not at all scared of anything here yet .,"classes are great , and i actually enjoy most of my professors .",they keep the class interesting .,the only thing i really fear is that i will slack off .,"i am great at doing my work , and i know that i will get the job done , but when it comes to reading assigned chapters , i have a history of not doing it .",that 's my greatest fear .,"most people fear they wo n't find friends , or will get homesick , but amazingly enough , i 'm not homesick at all .",i 'm actually doing very well here .,i met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that i 've come close to two of the people that i met .,one of which i am with usually everyday .,and friends from home also keep me strong .,high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me .,i finally gained the confidence in myself and i gained so much to my self esteem .,"on a normal , day to day basis , i try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles .","this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times , whenever i 'm feeling down .",my friends and family have also contributed to that .,they are so close to me .,my younger brother is someone i love and despise at the same time .,he 's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words .,he 's a genius .,he just does n't seem to know it .,"he loves to be different , which is n't exactly the best way to do things .",( especially when it comes to my parents ) .,"he 's not bad at all , just likes to argue his point , even though he knows he 's wrong .","he 's always there to help me out when i have a problem , and i know that .",he 's very strong too .,he never shows what he 's really feeling .,"for example , when i left to college , he acted as if it were no big deal .","well , in the last week , i 've recieved about 4 or more emails from him .","he does care , just doens't know how to show it .",my parents are also so great .,i 'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting .,the way they raised me is the best gift they could 've given to me .,they did an awesome job .,"i am so proud of being indian , and i 'm also very proud to be part of the family that i 'm in .",i would n't change that at all .,"i grew up in a city that really is n't that small , but to me and my friends .","i like growing up there , but i really wanted to get out of there to move on .","in a way i 'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone i need to , but austin itself is a lively town and something i really wanted .","i wanted to move to a big school , where you could meet a diverse crowd , and start over .","i had a startover point my freshman year in high school , and now once again in college .",i love it .,"i like to meet new people , because there 's so much you can talk about .","also , i love the effect of something unknown .","in this case , austin is a new adventure to me .","when i went to new york city a couple of years ago , all i wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy .","even though danger may come of it , i like to live life like that .",doing things i by myself is also something that has been in me all my life .,"i 've always been independent and i 'm fairly sure that 's becuase i take after my dad ( who moved to the us and started a family here ) , and because i 'm the older child .","i like doing things on my own , so then i know if i make a mistake , i can fix it .","i do n't like depending on others all the time , but i love being with people .","i know those are two contradicting statements but i do have those that i rely on , and i do consider connections when i need to .",it 's my word for people you know to get things you need done .,"overall , i love my life .",i ca n't ask for a better one .,"the ups and downs just add to it , and i want to live it to the fulliest .",coming here was a good decision on my part and i hope

i am so happy i ca n't really explain how i feel just that i am feeling great .,i know the reasons why i am so happy i just feel like telling everyone that i am so happy and i just want to smile a lot .,i would but other students would probably freak but then that 's okay cause there is to many people here in austin that i do n't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy .,anyways i have had so many hard days these past days buti think that i am going to be okay .,i do n't know why people do n't even talk to other people unless they know them .,today i actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university i can make others see me .,okay right now my feet hurt so much i did so much walking today just like the other days .,the difference is that i got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably do n't want to know that .,anyways i think i have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when i bought them .,which is good because i usually do n't loose weight or gain it just stay the same .,oh if i misspell a word i am so sorry but its just that when i am happy i ca n't really concentrate on spelling .,i 'll try not to make so many mistakes .,i have gone back and captalized all the i 's that were n't captalized .,right about now i feel my brain fried of so much thinking .,so i met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but i ca n't say who he is .,besides that i am really happy i feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well .,all this happiness is thanks to god because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own .,so thank you so much jesus because without you i would not be were i am today and who i am .,i know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how i feel and what i am thinking so no offence to no one in any way .,i so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she does n't it 's okay cuase i have her in my heart and in a dvd that my sister made for her .,so any time i want to hear my mom 's voice i just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy .,i wish i could describe this feeling and share it with every one but i ca n't .,it 's great !,anyways my minutes are almost up but after this i am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow .,i usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that 's the way to do it .,one teacher told me that if i wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.265323 -0.512719 1.100754 -0.848629 -0.079841 0.132909 -1.251495 -1.190551 -0.436535 -0.43898 -0.047003 -0.590446 -0.56184 0.152704 -0.6398 0.0 -0.04277 0.32785 0.783391 -0.795527 0.61231 0.102603 0.101468 0.011362 1.988211 -0.992216 -1.715261 -0.561335 -0.226032 0.6804 2.744325 -1.01368 -1.053635 -0.906028 -1.017959 0.259804 1.278543 1.106174 0.930417 1.146578 -1.038726 0.264009 -1.172935 0.783815 -0.648723 0.390172 1.874035 0.097102 0.793972 0.072061 -0.123612 -0.531355 0.252935 1.018152 0.103755 -0.417113 0.49683 -0.954251 -0.855645 2.190494 -0.881886 -0.867268 0.612766 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.812252 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.144467 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.271939 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.272373 5.411383 3.73636 4.799681 4.84268 4.352028,2369

right now i am having a weird feeling in the lower part of my stomach .,i 'm not sure if i just had a bad lunch or if it may be something a little more serious .,i 'm kind of sad too .,i talked to my family earlier and i realized how much i missed being at home .,last night i attempted to meet some new people despite the fact that i am just not the social type so i am kind of down about that too .,i hate walking up and down the stairs and stuff here at u. t. i ca n't stand the heat .,i mean i am from the rio grande valley but i never had to walk everywhere .,i hate the food in jester .,"i know i was n't supposed to talk about this until my second assignment , but right now college controls most of what i am thinking right now .","i forgot , keep typing , keep typing .",in a sense this stream of consciousness is n't as relaxed or real as one might assume it may be .,a lot of the thoughts are a little forced because you would have to put your thoughts into words .,that itself is n't too natural .,i am not a computer person either .,i guess it could be worse and i could be an extremely slow typer as well .,phew .,"you know , this is n't so bad .",it 's kind of fun .,this assignment simply requires that you ramble for twenty minutes .,it 's kind of quiet in here .,i just realized that .,my fingernails are really short .,i wish they could be a little longer .,a little more feminine .,one day i wake up and they are on their way to getting long and the next day i wake up and i 've either pulled on or bit them .,"even though i am not really the social type , i have managed to make some friends .",yea for me .,this guy in front of me looks like he 's all into his homework when i bet he 's just e-mailing his chick back home .,even though i just used the word `` chick '' i am not sexist .,"in fact , i hate that word .",i 'm not exactly into all this equal rights stuff .,"i think it is okay for men to play the macho , take charge role in society .","i mean , women are , as an entirety , weaker .",so what if we are the ones who play the nurturing half of the species ?,we have our strong points and so do men .,it balances out .,"every once and a while you get a person who is stronger in a different and'or unnatural area , but that is fine with me too .",there are a lot of computers in this room .,while i typed that i had another thought but i ca n't type 2 things at once so you just missed out on something .,of course it was n't important so who really cares ?,bop bop bop bop my brain stopped throwing out ideas just then .,my friends are sitting to each side of me .,i have n't talked to them since i started this assignment so it feels weird .,"oh , wait .",i had to talk to one briefly about why this thing typed all the way down to what seemed infinity until it returned to the next line .,she just told me to wait .,everyone says you gain fifteen pounds when you get to college .,i hope that is not true because i already feel fat enough as it is .,"so , have you sat down for twenty minutes and tried this assignment ?",how did it turn out for you ?,this is a pretty big screen .,"pretty big , indeed .",i 'm pretending to type fast .,"i hit keys and everyone probably thinks i 'm on a role with what i am thinking , when in reality i am just pretending .","crazy , huh .",would n't it be weird if i just snapped and from here on out everything i thought was as random and crazy as this .,this is n't a personality profile is it ?,you are n't going to call me in some time and discharge me from ut are you ?,i guess this is n't what you had in mind for stream of consciousness ( i do n't want to spell it takes too much brain power ) but i hope its kind of what i was supposed to do .,i am one of those students who is always scared of turning in assignments because they might be just plain wrong .,i 'm really tires of typing .,i just read what i typed `` i 'm really 'tires ' of typing '' that 's pretty stupid .,at least i know i am not one of those people who thinks a bunch of bad words when i am freethinking .,or at least i do n't think about sex or anything .,"well , i did talk about men and women and equal rights so i guess that kind of applies .",when i play with the keyboard it sounds kind of like a horserace .,"try it , it does .",all you have to do is establish a rhythm .,my fingers hurt still .,i wish i was really fluent in another language .,"type , i do n't want to type .",type i do n't want to type .,believe it or not those words just took the form as a song in my head .,i cheated .,i just talked to my friends sitting next to me .,i broke .,again .,i think i went a little over but this has been kind of fun ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'm really happy i started my workouts today even though i feel awful right now .,i need to get back in the shape i was before the marathon .,i do n't really feel like going out tonight at all but i have to go because i promised my friends .,i 'm not really big into parties i think they are sort of stupid i 'm always really uncomfortable because i do n't really know that many people except the guys they go with and i feel really weird just following them around .,oh well it does n't really matter i guess everyone there is drunk anyways i really want to go home this weekend and see zach i really miss him a lot i wish we could have both gone to the same school but we could n't .,thanksgiving is really far away and i do n't know if i can wait that long to see him .,we have been friends so long it feels really weird not seeing him everyday there are some good things about being here i never have to see ross or trevor i hate those guys .,i would like to lie and say they taught me something about myself balhaablaha but zach was right i never needed either or them .,dating zach is so weird but being friends first makes it more special .,i really miss sharon i ca n't believe she is going into the army in two days israel is so far away and i ca n't believe i wo n't see her for two more years .,kayla is at texas state with nathan and says she loves it i hope her and blake get back together she just loves him so much i feel bad that she 's sad about them breaking up with him and i do n't really know what to tell her .,i miss the basketball team so much i have pat and kellan here with me but zach and maury and matt and nathan and dotun are so far away i hate it i guess maury and zach are n't that far away dallas is n't that bad .,its sad though i wo n't be able to go back and see ben and dipot and my brother play since my parents moved i 'm sad i wo n't be able to go to reno with zach anymore but i guess he decided to stay home iwht me for,christmas so andrew and dotun will go by themselves without us christmas is going to be so fun with him i know zach feels like he will never mean as much to me as ross but i feel the same way about amy i think we both know what we,have is different but i really do n't like talkinga bout it with him i would rather just ahave fun together like we always do we know what we are to each other and i do n't think we need to keep talking about it .,i 'm over ross for good this time same with trevor and no matter how many times they ask me i wo n't get back together with them i do n't think zach believes me though i do n't konw what i can do to make him no so insecure,about us i do n't know whatever hell figure it out eventually .,its hard to talk to him though i could never hurt him though i just know him to well everything about him we grew up together so i know all the things that hurt him and he knows all the things that hurt me so i do n't know if,i could ever accidentally hurt him or say anything that would make him sad because i know exactly what those things are .,he knows those things about me too i think its better this way to know everything all the wounds a person has when you are with tthem there ar eno secrets between us because he was the person i always told me secrets to and he is still that person,i go to so i do n't understand why he thinks i will break up with him inever will he will have to break up with me because i refuse to hurt him i would never cheat on him eitheri love him too much and i respect him too much,i think it is just awful when people cheat on each other i do n't think its the worst thing you can do but it is still terrible you should care enough about the person to end it before you deliberatly hurt them that is just mean and selfish i,do n't think i could ever do that to anyone but especially to zach god i 've tlaked about him way to much i think but who care nobody will probably ever read this i miss him a lot i think its weird what happened alst weekend

this summer has been such a burden on me .,i am dwelling in it and it is eating me up .,i do n't know why exactly we broke up i just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected .,i find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me .,i just ca n't seem to let it go .,it might be because we were together for so long and go so close .,she was the best person god had ever put in my life .,"we seemed to click , it seemed so perfect , and she told me she felt the same .",she told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes .,she was scared .,she told me i meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her .,she had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me .,something she had n't let herself do with anyone else before me .,it felt so right .,"i was at such a high , life was so good .",i was happier than i had ever been .,i became so dependant on her for happiness .,"i know that is something that was unhealthy , but she had gotten just as dependant on me .",we had so many plans for the future .,we planned out every step of the way .,factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school .,"everyone is telling me to move on , but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us , for me not to let her go .",she wanted to get through this hell or high water .,nothing was going to tear us apart .,during the summer we got closer than ever .,we had many plans for the summer .,we bought tickets to concerts .,then she went off to camp .,she said nothing was going to happen at camp .,four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me .,what the hell happened at camp .,i go to warped tour and she with someone else .,"all i can do is give her a hug and say `` nice pick over 6 feet tall and blonde , just like i said. `` seeing as i was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same",description .,later she calls me and tells me it was n't what it looked like .,i blew up on her .,it was a normal reaction .,"everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring , and then bang , everything comes crashing down .",everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there .,and i completely defended her .,"cause i knew her better than anyone else , not only my thoughts but hers as well .",she was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past .,"every male figure in her past had let her down , and she could n't comprehend someone loving her as much as i did .","so because all the idiots in her past , i have to be let go because she ca n't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together .","why did she have to go , we were happy .",i do n't know what happened at camp .,it was more than seven weeks ago that i talked to her .,i called this week and left a message she did n't return .,i called again today .,she picked up we talked for 18 minutes and 36 seconds .,"she seems perfectly happy , just as free as a freaking butterfly , not caring at all , it seems , about what i am feeling .",how is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and i 'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable .,is everything that has happened a game to her .,i do n't understand how i can move past this .,i ca n't .,i do n't what to do .,i gave her everything .,and it feels impossible to get

so here goes .,i am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff .,it seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time i have to complete everything just keeps shrinking .,i hope and pray that as time goes by i will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life .,it has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work .,"but as my brother once told me , you must work hard in order to play hard .","i 'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly , and keep thinking positive about my situation .",i 'm hoping that i can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come .,well enough about that .,i 'm really starting to miss my family a lot .,i think that is really lame but i ca n't help it really .,"like i love austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of sunnyvale , texas that i miss incredibly .",i went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends .,gosh i love my friends here but its just not the same .,there is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave .,but i know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals .,and ut is the place to do it .,i love this place !,the people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change .,i am so excited about this weekend !,one of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and i keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend !,gosh you know what .,i 'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15 '' theory !,because i sure do eat a lot these days .,the food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist !,its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you .,no here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it !,its great !,its amazing to me how different college life is from high school .,like in high school everyone cared about everyone else 's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here .,no one cares about anyone else 's business at all .,people are just concerned with themselves .,and another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules !,like you can do whatever the heck you want and no one will tell you that you are wrong or that you ca n't do something .,"oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking , you can !",i laugh every time i see people doing that in my classes .,i would never be able to make myself do that because i 'm too much of a chicken but i think its so funny !,gosh .,i 'm really starting to get hungry again .,that is so bad !,no !,i ca n't eat again !,i am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm .,that is really late and i 'm extremely tired !,i really hope that i can find a date to anchors away .,that is really bugging me .,i wish i knew exactly who i wanted to take and who wanted to go so that i would n't have to worry about it anymore !,alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so i 'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me .,haha !,this was good .,its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once .,i actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper .,not to mention that i feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing i have to worry and stress out about .,well that is all i have to say for myself at this point and time !,peace !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

first of i would like to clear something up .,yes you did pay for bally 's but for the money you paid i wore walamrt and target clothes and payless shoes .,i also hardly think that the $ 30 a month you paid for me equates to the hundreds you pay for andrew .,second i paid for that fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at s & s .,in no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf .,i did earn a lot of money this summer .,i spent very little of it and saved most of it - so you would n't have to pay for stuff in college .,i do n't think having a car is a sign of love- i think it is a sign of favoritism .,that 's what makes me cry and get really upset .,the two main reason 's andrew got a car was not that he has a job ( that 's why he 's keepiong it ) but because he 's a male and dad obviously identifies with him more .,"nevermind that i try to save money , do well in school , or generally try to make life easy for you .","i guess maybe if i act like an obnoixious bastard , and think only of myself , and step over every one i could get a little appreciation in this family .","having a car here is imparactical and honestly , i do n't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing .",the damamge is done .,my whole life i felt loved and i 'm not saying i do n't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow .,i was very upset .,"not that i did n't mean what i wrote , but i could of said it in a kinder way .",i had a really long talk about it with will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing .,the reason i get so upset is not because i want a car ( it 's impractical here ) it 's that it symbolizes something .,"logically i know it means nothing , but i still hurt when i think about it .",i 'm really confused .,"i think i get emotional about it because i think it 's so unfair , i ca n't do anything about it , and i get so mad i cry .",another thing i have observed is i ca n't talk to dad about it .,i do n't know why i feel it necessary to `` protect him '' from me being sad about something he had a large part in .,i guess it 's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that `` he could n't afford it '' i ca n't even really talk about it with you ; i have to write about it .,i guess it 's because we 've communicated through notes for as long as i can remember .,maybe i get sad about it because i do n't understand why i feel this way and no one understands my feelings .,i really meant it when i said i did n't know what could return me to the way i felt before the incident .,and all the while i 'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car .,"i was upset about it at home , but here there 's a lot of time to think .","here , no one loves me .",sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that i was sure of at home .,the car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that 's why i 'm upset about it .,i know that objects do n't measure love .,"it 's just that you do n't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive , and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate .",i guess it 's really the injustice that hurts me .,this letter itself is really ironic in some way .,i write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously did n't think of my feelings at all -and here i am up at midnight worrying about yours .,"well i 'm going to bed now , i 've got school and work tomorrow .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-1.11658 0.585402 1.536428 0.182318 0.533712 0.049186 -1.369218 -0.621269 -0.487247 0.242617 -0.086306 -0.590446 -0.949499 -0.477364 -1.192274 0.0 -0.04277 1.106283 0.055894 -0.576514 -0.096278 2.236461 -0.646274 0.724204 0.362645 0.96411 -0.146114 -0.006498 0.297011 -0.141581 1.158677 -0.800539 0.605452 2.147884 -0.239329 1.304014 -0.047802 0.816913 1.183639 -1.032905 -1.038726 -0.602689 0.405769 0.442428 -0.839682 0.160824 1.708725 -0.505777 -0.041993 0.036709 -1.115945 -1.669758 0.710491 -0.458172 -1.311052 -0.927084 -0.886499 -0.370852 0.069214 -0.268551 -1.540293 0.337581 -0.480161 2.260051 -0.173193 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.531093 -0.503843 -0.073676 0.529024 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.844038 0.857829 1.429921 1.221279 0.579626 0.148208 4.439115 4.368005 4.507279 4.990097 5.069598,693

"the first thought that enters into my mind is my parents , whom i have been thinking about since i left houston for college .","it 's so different here , but not necessarily bad .",i have always been under the protection of my parents .,"but here , i do n't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed , and what to do .","i literally make all my choices , which i have to admit , i do n't always make the best decisions .",i do n't study when i know i should .,"sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that i know i should , and doing things like going out and having fun .",i feel like i should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute .,"but back to my parents , i feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me , because i am the last kid to leave home .",my mom has been crying constantly and i know that she is lonely because she does n't have me bumming around the house and eating her food .,sometimes i even feel sad because i now realize all the things my parents have done for me .,even though i thought they were always against me .,"when i think about the things they have sacrificed for me , i get teary .",especially when i think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before i left for austin .,"i got an acura integra , nothing i had ever expected .",i was so ecstatic and i had never gotten such a great present in my whole life .,i know that my dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than i had expected .,and now i 'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that i had taken for granted .,i really miss my parents and sometimes i have trouble dealing with it .,it 's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own .,my values are seriously getting tested because i do n't have them to give me advice anymore .,all i keep thinking is how much i love them and how i can possibly show my gratitude for them .,college is a tough thing .,"even though i went to an enormous high school , it ca n't compare to college .","my classes are huge , and sometimes very monotonous and boring .","surprisingly , the class i had thought was going to be tough and boring , became one of my favorites , economy .","mainly because my professor , hamermesh , is a great teacher .",he is lively and so humorous .,"the other classes , i really do n't care for much .",one thing i do hate about college life is the roommates .,"i live off campus on enfield , in a really nice apartment'condo .",my dad bought it with the intention that i have a nice place to live .,"it is two stories , and i have been trying to decorate it the best that i can .",but the problem is that i have to have roommates .,"one is this white girl , karmin , who i never met .","my dad posted a bulletin in a church up here in austin , looking for a roommate and she applied .","the other is a chinese girl , laura , i have known since i was a child .","i share a room with laura , so karmin has her own room , and she pays a little more .","however , i still end up paying more because it 's not fair to split a 1200 rent 3 ways .","so karmin pays 350 for her own room , which i consider a good deal .","laura is really messy , which bothers the heck out of me .","but lately , i have been dealing with it pretty well .",karmin is the most annoying and a constant pain on my mind .,she is older and she thinks that she is the ruler over the household .,"but she is messy , especially in public areas and i am the one who has to clean up after her .",and the thing that bothers me the most is that she is very stingy .,"she has a big tv in her own room , and vcr and then on the other hand , comes and watches tv that laura and i own .",so we are not allowed to use it .,"i borrowed her vcr the other day , and she asked me , `` when are you going to buy your own vcr ?","'' still , she is n't willing to share but does n't mind using our things .",same with the food .,"i really feel the need to tell her off , because she sure is getting a good deal living over here , and she ca n't have the right to treat this place as her own , she needs to respect us .","not only that , she hammered nails all up in her room , knowing that she is only living her for a year and it 's not fair to the other person who lives in that room next .","that 's my biggest problem and whenever i talk about it , i feel really agitated and stressed .","well , all i feel now is relief though , because my 20 minutes are up !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

t think that it would happen to me .,my parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but i would usually ignore that fact that i 'll end up in an accident .,"i would n't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful , but i would just let the message slide .",i would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents .,i should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment .,i sometiems feel that people do n't listen to thers anymore .,they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications .,girls might do this more than guys .,but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable .,i would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems .,it 's not that bad but it ; s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do .,i crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes .,i'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night .,this is different though .,i't what i say to myself .,i wonder if that will ever be ignore .,probably not since it 's not someone else controlling me but myself .,control is difficult to explain .,i 'm wondering when this will end .,another minute or so .,after a whild of this i started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not .,i do n't think i ; m a fast typer or a good typer .,just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes .,less by looking at my fingers ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.075232 -0.386137 -0.706319 -1.079214 -1.072874 -2.229488 1.654117 0.126082 0.591281 0.117658 -0.165879 -0.590446 0.423775 -0.446445 2.114665 0.0 -0.04277 -0.470489 0.726131 -0.795527 0.551896 -0.519606 -1.18 0.600504 -0.107545 0.111409 -0.239151 -0.190908 -0.890378 -1.141634 -1.100231 -0.770949 -0.034457 1.092264 -0.746232 -0.026486 1.199249 0.703855 2.074149 -0.232642 2.239627 1.442995 -1.594596 1.729838 1.349402 -0.013989 2.13364 -1.222769 0.867525 -1.509333 -0.137534 -0.082052 0.942168 -1.578541 0.541888 -1.278872 -1.087501 0.878103 -0.786968 1.492478 -1.312331 -0.151081 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.154088 -0.948667 -0.073676 2.163298 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.13099 -0.422267 -0.648393 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.742602 4.030805 3.824028 4.569695 4.613686 4.908411,1869

well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before .,and that would be how much i miss my best friend .,i was eating at wendy 's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 5 by then .,"so i ate a jr. cheese burger , medium fries , and some orange juice .","then i went bak and got a salad , frosty , and some water .",but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a hosa meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking .,and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend rakhi at texas a & m .,i do n't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her .,i guess i 'll get bak to her later when i think of more .,my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought .,and im guessing its most probably amit because it said unknown for the caller id which most prob .,means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that .,also i am really use to pushing ctrl s and i ca n't really do that here because i am not writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 90 % of the work i have done is saved every few,minutes because i really hate having to redo work .,now i guess i was just thinking of the clock .,i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 7 minutes .,i thought because of what monique said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough .,my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 2 o ' clock today .,once again .,i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her .,and she was like awwww i love you in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan .,and now the dorm phone rang and arpan called .,i guess we do n't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm .,lol .,but ya it was really cool that she called .,and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess ' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone !,well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i do n't know much else that i am thinking about currently .,i guess maybe finding out how much a greyhound ticket to a & m costs since i would love to go there .,"well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my mis homework , chek the emails from dell , check out the sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes ,","read some eco , go over eco notes , read some philosophy , and the philosophy book , read the beginning of the psychology book , and finish chapter 1 of mis , and finish reading developing you into me of ba101 .",wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on .,so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 2 o ' clock .,i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done .,it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that .,"besides all that , sid , my roommate , also suggested a movie at 9 playing for free at the union so i may look into that .",besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i do n't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so,i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it .,now my mind is just free i guess .,in regards to tom .,which is friday and now the phone just rang and now 20 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do -

at 855 i should be done writing this paper !,i am so excited that i get to go home and see my man today .,so my body really hurts right now but i feel great because i have worked out every day for like the past week and now i think i am addicted to working out .,it gives me such a rush and whoa !,someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me .,i hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating .,we have designated quiet hours in the dorm and there they go again !,no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala i really feel like dancing i think it would be cool it is funny how my typing ca n't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all i can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it,is that i have to do it for 20 minutes which i originally thought would be a short period of time but i look at the clock right now and it says 420 which means it is time to smoke .,lol that is if i smoked weed which i do n't i actually find that to be so stupid .,why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life .,sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have .,psychology is such an interesting major .,"i just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems , surprisingly , like it will be a lot of fun !",i am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that i can cut it i just hope i maintain my gpa and can be like what now !,i love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once i finish it is the best feeling kind of like the `` high '' i get when i exercise i need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale,i am excited to be going home to see my b ' f but i really do n't want to see my family that is probably the one thing i do n't miss all that arguing i ca n't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me,is my relationship with my man .,"he is older i know and i do love him or at list i think i love him and i would never want to hurt him , but i am scared about settling down after college for so many years i saw college as being the perfect time to party","and meet boys , but now it is n't like that i love to flirt but i have someone that cares about me and that i care about but i just do n't know to i want to settle down with someone that does n't even have a high school",diploma .,i 'm scared he 's going to end up using me or something stupid like that .,i know that is mean but so far he does n't keep his promises to me and he lies and i pay for everything but it does n't matter he will pay me $ 200 i think i have spent over $ 1000 on our relationship .,going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks .,oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 20 minutes of my life i am starting to get typer 's cramp .,is that possible ?,well staring at this screen sure is n't helpful at all !,i am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first i have to wait to finish this paper then i got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile .,i wonder what i 'm going to wear i want to wear my brown shoes but do i have anything natural colored to go along with it i have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm i really should look would white go ummm i need to paint,my toenails !,i can so do that when i get back from eating actually i think naw i do them when i get back look only 3 and a half more minutes i think my roommate is back nope someone else i wonder where she is because her class got out at,9 but normally she comes back early .,i really hope i make the crew team i think that would be so cool .,i want to make a team and feel special just something else to tell myself that i can do it everyone keeps saying because i am tall but it will be a whole new experience because i know nothing about the sport man i need to brush my teeth what,can wear damn i got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that

so i do n't really know what to type about .,i hope this does not have to be like grammatically correct or anything because i do n't ever use capital letters .,twenty minutes is a really long time .,i do n't know if i can even type that lone .,i do n't know if i ever have in my entire life without stopping or taking a break .,is weird to write down what i 'm thinking because i think i try to think about what to write so i 'm not completely sure this is really what i 'm thinking .,i hope no one reads this too carefully .,so its always been really cold in my room but now its kind of hot .,i think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings .,i keep thinking about kurt and i wonder if i should call him back or not .,everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but i do n't even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did .,i think my foot is falling asleep .,i almost wish i had a desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small .,my hand keeps hitting the mouse while i type and it waves around in front of what i 'm writing and that makes it hard to concentrate .,"anyways , i do n't want kurt to think that i have been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first a pop up just came up on my screen .",i did n't think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp .,ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and i did n't want to because with all my pop ups i figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so i,tried to push the little x in the corner and it would n't close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work .,at first i thought it was for this maybe it was but then i got back to this screen and my time was starting all over .,that sucks .,i hope this is over soon .,anyways i 'm still thinking about kurt .,no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together .,he could just want to talk .,he did say the first time that he just called to see how i have been .,and i 'm still mad at him for what he did but i do want to forgive him because i just do n't want something like that hanging over me forever and i hate to hold grudges .,and i do want us to be friends and i know it would be hard for me to say i did n't want him back but even if that is what he wanted i would n't do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me .,plus i 'm in college and i do n't need to have a boyfriend back home .,i need to meet people .,but i really do miss him a lot .,i hope it gets easier .,which is part of why i will call him because i really need to close that part of my life and end it and i ca n't think of the word but something like finalize it .,i hope my battery does not die on my laptop and i hope that another popup does not come and mess up my time again because i really need to get this done .,i have a lot to do today .,but i 'm glad i got done what i did this morning .,i need to find out about the whole football ticket draw thing .,and i hope i wrote down in my planner about that trig review class .,then i have all those small chores that i have to do tonight but i do n't think ill have time especially since this is taking so long .,i have never experienced a longer twenty minutes than this in my life .,at least i should be improving my typing skills .,i hope it rains this weekend or even today .,no maybe tomorrow because ill be outside today .,i ca n't wait until it get cooler outside so i can walk places .,yeah right like i really will but maybe i really will .,i have taken the stairs up to my room a few times .,i think i may fall asleep after this or maybe even right now .,i need to move my leg this hurts .,wow i 'm really really sleepy o i also need to remember to call joey back tonight before i call back kurt .,i feel so bad i hope he is not mad at me for ditching them but i needed to go out with christi because we had n't really done anything together .,and i 'm glad i did because that was a lot of fun .,but i do hope he is not mad or anything and we can get together later .,i wonder if i should join the texas exes .,i do n't know if this is really what i 'm thinking because i know in the back of my head all i 'm really thinking about is how much i hate typing all this and how i ca n't wait until its over but at least i 'm doing,it today instead of tomorrow night so ill have it done and do n't have to worry about it .,i 'm going to try and not procrastinate .,bad start though i 'm only on chapter one in psychology those chapters are so long and boring i hate that book .,i hope this does not deduct points .,i wonder if i should stop now since that pop up messed up my timer .,oh well i only have about four minutes left anyways so i might as well keep going .,o i need to go tanning tonight too .,ahhhh i have so much to do tonight and most of it involves reading that damn psychology book o and i have to read that philosophy book .,i really like my schedule how it is though that is nice that i do n't have any real classes today so i can get caught up .,yay i 'm almost finished good because i 'm really sleepy now and i want to take a nap even though there is no way that i really have time for that but maybe i will anyways just like a few minutes to rest my eyes yeah right ill fall, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"right now , i am feeling a little tired , a little overwhelmed , excited , and also a little afraid .",i am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise .,i am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that i have found myself in in the last couple of weeks .,"its not really that i am overloaded with work ( yet ) , it is just that i am still getting used to everything here : new and different classes , new ways of studying and testing , new teachers and techniques of teaching , etc .","i am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings : a new room , roommate , sleeping schedule , eating schedule , etc .",i am excited because i think i am going to enjoy living and going to school here .,"i am excited about taking courses that i 'm actually interested in , and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing .",i am excited about meeting new people .,one of the things that i enjoy most about austin is the diversity of the people you can find here .,"no matter what kind of person you are , you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns .",i have already met some very fascinating people .,austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the university .,"if i 'm not mistaken , it is the music capitol of the world .",i could go on for a long time about all the reasons why i am excited .,i am afraid mainly for the same reasons that i am overwhelmed .,mostly i am afraid that i do not know how to take notes and study properly .,i find myself looking at others people 's notes during lecture to see if i am writing down the important things and whether or not i am getting the point .,"my mom says that in time , i will learn what to write down , read , and study .",i have never been a very good test taker .,my biggest fear of all is the fact that i have always relied on the one on one attention that i received from my teachers in the past to get me through school .,"now that i am attending the largest university in the county , i know that that is impractical .","however , i plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids .","with an average of 540 students in your classes , i know that you can not offer that same oneonone environment .",that is my greatest concern ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.949701 -0.600626 1.679096 -1.168077 -0.860061 -0.640394 2.316788 1.384542 2.145842 -0.916098 -0.101245 -0.590446 0.277202 1.217646 2.638739 0.0 -0.04277 -1.007434 -0.229843 -0.795527 -0.456731 1.806956 -0.998356 1.352059 -0.624052 1.5587 0.214378 -0.244097 0.533765 0.750335 0.556802 -0.891427 -0.022389 4.321132 -1.017959 1.251097 -0.466086 1.612796 1.002092 -1.747428 -1.038726 -1.813412 1.395079 -0.656756 0.084878 -1.126121 -0.134219 -0.44982 -0.466838 -0.36984 0.630331 -0.240858 -1.312812 0.154697 -1.367201 -0.127338 -0.429546 1.042873 0.934654 0.229928 0.112189 -1.126327 -0.480161 -0.102217 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.432126 1.015299 0.384385 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.255334 0.980081 0.01417 -0.376121 4.482016 4.416973 4.512885 5.080522 4.730843,1312
"i feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes , but at the same time am overjoyed to be here .","i spent a year at stephen f. austin for my freshman year of college and liked it alright , but the school was not right for me , i think it had more to do with the town than the school , but anyhow i like being in austin and","love being around old friends , but at this moment i feel as if i have n't gotten into the school year just yet .","i have n't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient , worthless .",but i do n't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year .,two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me .,"right now i feel relaxed , relieved to be through with classes today .",tomorrow is another day and i feel like i have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished .,another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment .,this is the first day i have been able to get into the ugl computer library and luckily i made it in before the deadline .,i tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines .,these are so much better than the computers from sfa that i think i shall nut my pants .,"one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles , such as uncapitalized letters , lack of punctuation ,",all borders are allowed to be crossed and i love this freedom .,"i am feeling very good about myself right now i have just completed my first assignment of the year , well almost completed .",i hope i have done this right and this has actually been fun .,i look forward to writing on this assignment again .,i have 4 more minutes to write i think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer .,i am thinking about how this will be graded .,i wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what i am writing in real time .,and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not .,i think i may stay here all day i like doing work and doing work well i am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that i may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors .,i love school what else do i need to accomplish ?,i have to sign up for some experiments as well i 'd best do that also .,"i am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed .",i think i have wrote enough but am not sure .,so anyway i am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime .,this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced ?,"experienced , and to learn how the brain works is good to , and to learn how the world works , that 's good to i love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane , i am wishing i had a","disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style i like it i am going to do it again , .",goodbye i am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes .,i wonder what i will wish i had accomplished when i look back ten years from now .,like i look back and wonder when did i think i would be right now ten years ago ?,hmmm that 's ponderous man really ponderous .,i am glad to be here rather than home because at home i can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that i have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes .,like if kori came over i would

"i had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time i wanted to do it or remembered to do it , my boyfriend michael was in the room .",i did n't feel like i could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if i knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second .,i guess i knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time ; stuff that i did n't want him to know about .,he would kill me .,"not in the literal sense of course but in any case , he would be destroyed .",if i told him what i was thinking it would be the end .,i do n't want it to be the end .,"i 'm not saying i do n't want it to ( i 've got mail , and i really want to check it , but i 'm going to keep typing ) go on forever , but i love him enormously and if i told him that while he was",gone for an evening i slept in another guy 's bed and we ended up fooling around .,that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with michael .,"i 've always been big on honesty , but why ca n't i bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between damian and i ?",maybe because he 'd ask why and i 'd say that i 'm not even really sure why .,that 's a big problem with our conversations .,if he asks me why or what 's wrong ( he says `` what ?,"'' a lot ) i ca n't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then i usually ca n't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if i attempt to describe it , then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he 'll bring",it up later because he 's like an elephant .,he never forgets .,so i 'm still trying to figure out why ?,maybe i needed something exciting .,i 've known michael for years and we 've been dating for over 8 months .,"i was never really physically attracted to him , but only later i was because i loved him .",the first time i met damian i almost stopped in my tracks .,i do n't know why .,maybe it was because the first time i saw him was when i walked into a friend of a friend 's apartment ( he 's my friend 's friend 's roommate ) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop .,"after that night i could n't stop thinking about him and i heard ( dang it , why did n't i put an away message for my instant messenger .",that friend of mine that i was just talking about imed me but i told her i had 10 minutes left so i 'll talk to her later .,probably about this assignment and because we 've been discussing this damian issue ) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too .,the next time i went over there i did n't really talk to him much .,but the third time i was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there .,after that we started emailing each ( okay taking the towel off of my head .,"or maybe not , my hair 's not quite dry yet .",i 'll just unwrap it ) other .,"then the night two weeks ago that michael went to a concert , i went to damian 's apartment with my friend and we all hung out .",nothing too spectacular .,"i did n't intend on staying over but i developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night i was so sick that i could n't move , much less drive .",the guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so i would n't have to drive home and the rest is history .,i felt so guilty lying in bed with him though .,he had asked me if he could get in bed with me and i said yes .,i said yes .,i did n't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back .,i did n't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but i did n't pull away either .,"i was very still when he kissed my forehead , but i did n't tell him to stop there .",why did n't i ?,because i wanted it .,"but i have a loyal , devoted , loving , honest , wonderful boyfriend already .","why did i want this , or think i needed it ?",it was thrilling .,even though damian was a bad kisser .,it was like kissing a large mouth bass .,eventually i gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined .,it was n't really sexual .,for the most part .,this is making me sound horrible .,i probably am horrible .,"yeah , i am .",this was cheating .,"and by not telling him and by still communicating with damian via phone now and still email , i continue to be deceptive .",damian does n't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to london at the end of the year .,and i do n't love him .,i do n't really know him .,i 've hardly been around him except for three or four times .,we 've had two meaningful conversations .,the whole concept of a relationship with him is silly .,"yet i have n't been able to stop thinking about him since i met him and wondering about him , etc , etc .",i just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me ( just got out of the shower before i started this ) .,"my palms are kind of damp , not good for a laptop probably .","okay , it 's been more than 20 minutes so i 'll stop now .",i wonder why i wrote a confession of sorts .,and i wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this .,"i 'd better not save this , just in case michael finds it .",i 'm terrible ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 've always wondered how the mind works .,what are people really thinking when they say one thing .,why do they say one thing and mean another ?,people can be so confusing .,"i wonder what college life will be like , and if there will be people there who will act like that and just say one thing to me while meaning another .",it 's all so overwhelming right now .,"computers have never been my strong point , and all of a sudden , everyone wants everything done on a computer .",it 's strange and somewhat exciting .,"i like living out on my own , without my parents watching over everything i do , but i am beginning to get a little homesick .",i miss being able to see the stars at night and to feel the breeze on my face as it blows my hair back off of my neck .,"i went to a star party last night , and the stars were barely visible .","i wanted so much to be able to see them , but i could n't .",i felt like i could cry at that moment .,"i did n't though , because then my friend would laugh at me .",he does n't think i 'll make it here on my own .,"i guess i am somewhat of a daddy 's girl , but i can be alone .",i enjoy being able to hear myself sometimes .,i have to be alone to write poetry and to think about who i am .,i wonder when i 'll figure myself out .,i want to be somebody important someday .,i want to make other people feel welcome and to make myself feel good about helping others .,"i guess in a way , whenever i try to make others feel good about themselves , i 'm doing it with the underlying purpose of making myself feel good .","i suppose that 's okay , but it seems to defeat the purpose of helping others when all i 'm really accomplishing is helping myself .",i think life has so many hidden points that no one will ever find all of them .,"i wish i could search the world over until i could find all the secrets of the history of people 's actions , but that will never happen .",people are so secretive that so much history is lost .,"there are some people that claim that it can be found , but there 's got to be more exciting history out there .",what would the world be like if everything interesting was discovered .,then there would be nothing to wonder about .,things would be dull for the future .,i wonder if somebody across the world is taking this exact same course and writing this exact assignment right now as i 'm doing .,that would be the coolest thing ever .,i wish on stars every night and feel that life is to be cherished .,"i wonder if there is another woman out there with my exact feelings and thoughts , that looks exactly like me , only another color maybe or size .","so many questions i ask myself will never be answered , but what if someone is watching me right now across this computer lab and wondering how i feel and what i 'm thinking at this very moment .","if only i knew , maybe i could meet up with this person and tell him'her my thoughts .",i would love to share with someone i do n't know .,i 'm afraid of rejection though .,"there are so many people on this campus , and hardly anyone has talked to me yet .",somehow i feel inferior to some of them .,i do n't know why .,"everyone is equal , but some

home with me to visit my parents .",i do n't understand the need for human contact .,we would be so much better off if we did n't get caught up in emotions and feelings .,"but then again , we would n't be human if that did n't happen .","i know i could be more efficient if i did n't need anyone else in the world , but as it is , i have faults .","that 's okay , though .",everyone has faults .,it 's just part of being human .,i hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me .,"as i come to a close on my writing , i feel purged of all my frustrations .",i had a good cry this afternoon

$ 3 .,00 !,"i got a free coke , a free corner of a sandwich , 2 free candy bars and i bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks , which by the way was really tasty .",it is in my refrigerator now because i have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago .,well tomorrow at 3:30 i will be done with classes for the week and i am thinking of driving home for the night to lake jackson .,"it is a three hour drive , but i am not really homesick , just feel kind of lost .",the reason i 'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer .,see the one i have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three dell representatives'technical experts the battery will not charge .,"so they have sent me a entire system replacement , after first trying to merely replace the battery .",which is what should happen because when one orders a $ 2000 system they would hope it would work .,so my next class is in about an hour and a half .,it is biology which is interesting to me for the most part .,"it is my major , but i have been planning on changing it .",i chose it mostly because what i was interested in was medicine and i wanted to go to medical school after college .,"now , i am not quite sure that is what is for me , although it was never a sure thing .",now i was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where i could take more classes of interest to me and also spanish which i recently tested out of 13 hours !,i could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school i decide on .,there are so many decisions to be made .,now that i have finally chosen a college .,i still am wondering about that decision .,"i mean i have always loved texas , my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer .",maybe that is the problem too much ?,"i just sort of feel like i 'm not fitting in , but then again is n't that what ut is about , being an individual ?","well , i definitely like to be an individual and my own self , but i would like some friends , a group who 'll call and see what i 'm doing , call to hang out .",i mean i have been here only 11 days and i 'm worried ?,"well not yet , i am still giving it time .",but i just feel so down on myself and anti-social .,the only people i have really hung around are from my hometown .,"not that it 's all bad , i just was so ready to branch out into something new !","so going home just seems like a good answer at the time , i even thought maybe i chose the wrong college , but how can i say that when i 've been here not even two weeks .","at home , making friends was always easy .",i was the center of focus there .,"had everything , here there is so many that i am , well , unnoticed .",that in itself is a change .,but then i think is n't everyone else going through the same thing ?,"then if everyone else is , then why do n't we just get together ?",well i guess the world does not work that way .,"but i have not given up yet , there is still hope .",the first football game is saturday and i know that will reinforce my love for the school .,i loved going to the games when i was n't a student at this school .,maybe i can meet some friends then .,so it is labor day weekend coming up .,"mostly i need to be studying , but that is what school is about .","i think we may float the river , so that will be fun .","i have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight , but i have a study session for bio at 7pm , , hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim , change and make it over to welch .",i just am not sure how to work it all out .,"drive , walk , ride the bus .",i do n't live in a city and things are so different here .,"the town i am from , i did n't even live in the city limits .",hhmmmm .,but i really need to workout .,i am not going to get fat in college .,"i need to lose pounds right now , not gain them .","but food is everywhere , i guess you can see by the free food .",well maybe i can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking .,but the candy bars are n't good .,"ok , before next class i need to read some bio and some psychology , but what i really want to do is lay in my bed , listen to music , watch tv maybe take a nap ?",nope not here in the college world .,"wow , i like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

our world is pretty fucked up .,"i 've been watching and reading the news lately , and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with .","well not the only thing , but almost the only thing .","the world has enough problems with natural disasters , why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves .","between hurricane frances and soon to be hurricane ivan , why do we need chechen rebels , and radical terrorists , and radical governmental regimes to make things worse .",why is it that people ca n't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right .,"be it a christian , a muslim , or an atheist , every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong .","so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen , but also , others make excuses about it too ?",`` they 're religious .,they 're unstable .,they 're on medication .,they 've had a hard life .,man fuck that .,"people need to first take responsibility for their actions , and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what 's wrong is wrong .",i do n't understand this blur of morals and truth .,how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being does n't know the difference between right and wrong ?,"i suppose i 'll get off my soap box now , i just ca n't fathom the world getting worse , and yet i know that tomorrow , will be even just a little bit worse than today .","the only thing i can do is try and change my own actions , my own beliefs , and hopefully lead by example .","so i was just reading bush has tried cocaine , while bush senior was president .",ha .,"that makes me laugh , i say more power to bush , he says he 's clean , i believe him , i do n't think his past should be this big of an issue , especially when he is running against john kerry .","i do n't even want to vote , but i feel its my duty .",so who am i going to vote for ?,its like picking the lesser of two evils ?,and which one is lesser of a sob than the other one ?,man i do n't know .,"i suppose i 'll vote for bush , being that this is texas .",but i do n't know if i 'd feel right about that .,maybe i 'll just write in a vote .,i mean i know all of texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter ?,maybe i 'll run for president one day ?,"naw , i doubt it , i 'm not moderate enough .","not that i 'm a radical , just that i do n't think i could say things to appease one person or another .","i have my beliefs and damn it , i 'm sticking to 'them .","that does n't mean i 'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments , but i 'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes , that 's a fucked up way of doing business .",this feels good by the way .,"i 'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me , they 're very loud and annoying .","i kind of want to say something to them , but then again they 're very large men , and , since i 'm making snap judgments , they 're probably alpha males who would want to fight me .",so i 'll just let them be .,my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently .,"they 're a couple years older than me , and i 'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her .",she dumped him because she did n't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together .,"i can understand and appreciate where she 's coming from , but he was tore up about it .","anyway , they 're here and talking about stuff , i can tell things are getting intense .","i did n't even know they were going to be here , and technically i was here first so i suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal .","she will probably start crying soon , and he will just shake his head because he does n't know what to do .","man , i feel sorry for them both .","he just wants to love her , be there for her .","and she does n't want to hurt him , but she has no choice , she is n't in the same place he is .",love is a funny thing .,love is a fucked up thing too .,i 've only been in love once .,and i 've fallen out of love once .,its a painful process .,"but then again , i would n't replace it .","it was a profitable , great , shitty , learning experience , one that i can completely support .",so why is it that humans love ?,or choose to love ?,or choose not to love ?,"i 'd like to be able to love someone again , that 's a good feeling .",to be able to call someone and just talk to them .,"see how their day was , what they 've been up to , and to know that they wanted to talk to you , and ask you about those same things .",i wonder what my wife will be like ?,i wonder when i 'll meet her .,my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married i think .,"i may be wrong , but i doubt it .",i think they 're both in a place where they 're ready to commit for the long haul .,that 's kind of scary .,"hey , my brother is going to be married forever .",i 'm going to have a sister in law .,maybe i 'll be an aunt or uncle soon .,now that is really weird .,its crazy how time moves .,"i feel like graduation was a long time ago , but at the same time i feel like i still think and act like a 6th grader .","oh 6th grade , those were good days .",i thought i was the coolest kid in the world .,"and at the time , i may have been right .",i was one cool 6th grader .,it rained today .,"i love the rain , its so refreshing , so new , so clean , so pure .",it makes me appreciate the day that much more .,i 've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today .,"reading , writing , talking , thinking , listening , all things i can support 100 % though , so it has n't been a wasted day in the least .","i ate at freebirds today too , that was so good .","i 'd say the feeling i have after i eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings i 'll ever have to being completely content , lacking absolutely nothing in the world .","because when i 've finished freebirds , i do n't even desire love , because i am so full and content i do n't need anything else .",its a good feeling .,i 'm thinking about what i 'm thinking about writing .,if that makes sense .,"it is supposed to be stream of consciousness , and i 'm working on that , but i think that i 'm thinking too much about it .","i 've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point , now i 'm thinking too hard about writing something .","its ok though , because i only have like 15 seconds left .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i am thinking about calculus .,i wish i could be working on calculus instead of doing this assignment .,i wonder if i am doing this assignment correctly .,"do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking , or in question'sentence format .",well i made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how i have been taught to write at school for so long .,i am hungry .,"i should have made prepared something in the oven , so when i am done with this assignment i would be able to eat it .","now i have started so i must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty , or approximately 17 more minutes .",i am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is .,i guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking .,"i want to type things in here as if i was talking to someone , but then again i quickly remember that i am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness .",how fast should i be typing .,"should i think about it , then type it , or think about it as i am typing it , or is it a combination of both .","today , i have thought so much about thinking .",a new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible .,i can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus i am better able to control what i am thinking .,"this is good because the more control of yourself you have , the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also .",i think that sentence did not make much sense but i know that i know what i am talking about .,i am still really hungry .,i wonder how many minutes i have to go .,"oh , its at the top of the screen , so far i have completed 8 minutes .",what else is there to talk about ?,i don ' e exactly know what im thinking about right now .,wait .,ok. .,i think i am thinking too hard .,well what would you like me to write about .,what i think about really depends on what i am trying to think about .,and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank .,"but then again , it is not blank at all .",i feel like today was a great day .,everyday that i am alive is a great day .,"i also think that i worry too much , but when i worry less i have time to think about the things that really matter .",but what really matters ?,i am soooooooooo hungry .,i only have 9 more minutes to go .,"this writing assignment has to be one of the easiest , requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments .",but this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that i am actually starting to see how this ( thinking ' stream of consciousness ) works .,"once i master it , i feel like i will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world .",to find one 's self .,ok. .,now my stomach is growling .,i will be so happy when today is over and i get to lay my head to rest .,i am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that i think about it .,it really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break .,today i feel like my mind has been in overdrive .,"i have had at least three people tell me i am deep , and i met alot more people today .",user 's guide .,this book sitting right in front of me .,"i guess i took a break in thinking , and that is what i saw .",i am so tired .,"physically , mentally .","i have not pushed myself as much as i did today , and somehow i know it will be for the better .",i am so glad that my parent 's pushed me to go to college .,i think it is an absolutely great'priceless experience that everyone owe 's to themselves .,"knowledge is power , knowledge about one 's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life .",i love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior .,well i just looked at the time again and i have approximately 30 more seconds ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"well , this is interesting .",let 's see .,"right now , i feel like i 'm not even doing homework , really .","sarika , mary and natasha are quizzing each other on medical terminology , which seems so much more .",studious than what i 'm doing .,but i do n't mind .,let 's see .,my hands have been smelling kind of funny .,"like rust , almost .",but i have n't touched anything rusty .,"except , i did clean the shower today , and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell , even when you 're using gloves .","other than that , i do n't really smell anything .","god , my stomach is rumbling like crazy now .",i really want to eat .,"i 'm so mad at myself , if i had just gone to that freshman business meeting , i would be eating free pizza now .","but no , i have to be a `` conformist '' and go when all my other friends are going .",now i have to pay for my food .,"and even now , i 'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying .",why am i such a follower ?,i hope i gain some leadership qualities through my college experience .,"i wonder why the microfridge makes that noise , that constant hum .","did you know , something 's wrong with the microfridge in my room .","we had it set at level 5 , and we open the door , and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water , and there are pearly crystals in our milk .","man , that was weird .","i lowered the temperature a little , hopefully that helps .","the strange thing is , our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 5 , and their food is fine .",are n't all the microfridges supposed to be the same ?,fridge discrimination .,anyway .,what else is there to say ?,my eyes feel sleepy .,"not in the heavy sense though , where you feel as though you could n't keep your lids up if your life depended on it .","no , not that kind of sleepy .","it 's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them , and you have mild sinus symptoms .",or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness .,"either way , i should be sleepy , i did a lot of work today .",i 'm so proud of my productivity today .,"after calculus , i went straight to the library , printed out my ubc application , then went straight to one of the desks and did my psychology homework .","that 's right , two and a half hours of reading and taking notes .",i even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron .,whoa .,sometimes i think i work too hard .,"i mean , did i really have to write down all the processes of the neurons ?","ultimately , i probably wo n't need half the stuff i 've taken note of .","luckily , i actually kind of enjoy psychology , so i do n't mind taking the notes .","man , i need to spit out this gum .",it 's like i 'm chewing rubber or something .,and my jaw hurts from all the exercise it 's gotten .,"i think i 've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours , if not more .","man , i have to laugh at the way these girls are studying .",they 're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology .,here 's the funniest one : `` penia '' means abnormal reduction .,"so , what does my gutter-mind think of ?",hahaha .,"i ca n't help it , i 'm still immature .",hopefully my professors do n't get wind of it .,"but you must admit , that 's a good way to remember `` penia '' , is n't it ?","i 'm not even in medical terminology , and i will always remember that term .","oh god , my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now , in addition to the burning .",why do i get so tired here ?,"true , i can probably sleep at any time , but i 've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since i started school at ut .",maybe it 's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today .,"i was feeling pretty fit last week , maybe now i will get sick during labor day weekend .",let 's see .,six more minutes .,"sorry , but i am counting down .",who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long ?,"i like using big words , it makes me feel so intelligent .","i know that 's immature to think , but i really am just a child inside , filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy .","yes , petty jealousy .","like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus , many of whom are my friends , which makes me feel all the worse , because are n't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends ?",but i suppose that would n't be human .,"but guilt is a totally human feeling as well , so i will continue feeling that .","sometimes i wish i was my puppy , ginger , with my biggest worry being that i 'll see my own reflection on a window .",did you know that dogs sleep about 18 hours every day ?,i would kill for such a luxury .,"even when i 'm retired , i doubt i 'll receive such a luxury .",i can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm .,or perhaps they were already warm .,who knows .,i definitely do n't .,"sorry , but seeing as how i only have about two minutes left , what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that i 'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time .",i need to go to sleep .,"but no , it 's only six in the evening .",six !,it 's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here .,is n't it supposed to be bedtime ?,i want to sleep .,i want to sleep .,i want to sleep .,and dream .,"i wish i could remember my dreams better , or that someone could analyze my dreams .",or maybe i do n't want that .,who knows what would turn up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i love my girlfriend leah .,she is so awesome .,"i love her big butt and her hair , i love her tongue and her smile .",man oh man does she give good hand jobs .,almost as good as sex .,almost .,there are some things i do n't like about her though .,she is a tiny bit chubby but it does n't really bother me that much .,she is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves .,i also worry that she is a shopaholic .,and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income .,i wonder what i will be doing 5 years from now .,it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj .,i think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time .,"i believe that would be best , cause then i could stay up late still and sleep in a little later .",the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too .,"i would have fun being the dj in the morning , but i would hate the hours .","i mean whoa , not my kind of lifestyle .",i also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out .,i have n't been really an active gym goer .,i need to start doing that .,i am trying to think of what would be a good time to go .,"on mondays i could go right after class at 5 , same thing goes for wednesdays .","on tuesdays , thursdays and fridays , i should probably go right after spanish , because then after i am done i could go eat something , that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that i would n't have to eat before i go",to spanish then .,"i could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday , wednesday and friday .",and then weight train on tuesday and thursday .,maybe i should do the opposite .,"cause then i could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out , plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time .",now about tennis .,i really hope i can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice .,i should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things i need to do .,"it would be cool if leah and sara came to ut next year , unfortunetly i do n't see that happening when it comes to leah .",i wonder how long i should wait before proposing .,i think waiting til at least my junior year would be best .,because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship .,"i mean two years is a long time to be with someone , and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together .",no wait they were actually 3 .,"5 years i think , maybe 2 .",5 when he asked and 3 .,"5 before marriage , i do n't know , whatever it is .",the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money .,i could probably go back to heb cause i mean they do n't pay that poorly .,possibly even be a ccm or something so that i could bring a little extra dough in .,i would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station .,i wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show .,i should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if i could get some kind of spot in there .,"even if it was n't a show , but a technical thing .",okay so when it comes to homework what should i do so that i have somewhat of a schedule .,"if i sleep in the mornings , or at least plan to , i do n't think i should try scheduling that in .",what i should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure i get hw done first before i do anything else .,because then i could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job would n't be too bad .,"cause that 's probably my problem , the fact that i do n't go to sleep early enough .","i want to go to midnight rodeo this saturday , i just wish roger creager was n't playing there .",remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later .,back to study .,"monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all i have is my writing class easy , and spanish , so getting out late on those days is n't too bad .","tuesdays and thursdays i should try to make sure i am done with hw by like 6 , cause then i could go eat after i did my hw .",that 's a pretty good plan .,only on occasions should i change that up .,"what i mean by that is like being invited to do stuff , never let it be online poker or tv that distracts me , that includes playing xbox .","even if i think i have had a hard day so far , just think how more satisfying that resting will be once i have everything done , i mean knowing u do n't have anything left to do is a nice feeling .",this writing this is going by faster than i thought .,i did n't know i had all this stuff on my mind .,"i think it would be nice to have a 6pac on my body , and some muscle .","you know , it really does kind of upset me that leah does n't want me hanging out with females alone .",i find that it should n't matter .,"i mean on one hand i know her past , and i do n't want to upset her on something as small as this , but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal .",maybe i should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this .,hopefully we can compromise .,"i am kind of tired but i really do need to study for spanish quizzes tomorrow , and i should look over chapter 4 for this class .","i wonder when the first test is , i think it is on the 20th .",that 's coming up pretty soon .,i should look at that handbook thing i have on sample test questions on this friday .,"along with that i could reread philosophy and study some more spanish , and go to a seminar for writing class .",this was kind of a fun thing to do .,"i kind of like having a diary like this , helps me think clearly .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i hear nicole 's printer printing i 'm so glad she is my roommate i really like the song that 's playing on the radio i wonder if my laundry is ready yet paul is a big poo face i wonder if i should tell hijm about my date with,zach on friday it 's under the table i do n't think that i 'm very good at this stream of consciousness thing i have to look at the keys when i type on it 's kinda annoying i wonder if the professor takes off for stupid internet phrases like,lol or kinda man i really ca n't stand paul i hope that zac does n't turn out to be someone who 's just looking to be laid this assignment seems like it 'll be really easy someone just popped up on i 'm i wonder if it was dylan,i 'm supposed to go to a concert with him on friday but zac and i were supposed to go out then i wonder what it would be like to live in austin for all your life new braunfels really sucks at some points in time right no my stomach,feels kinda weird probably fro the spaghetti i ate at dinner and nicole 's macaroni she htes macaroni cause she got a noodle caught in her throat one time which reminds me of the time i got a peppermint caught in my throat ooh walking on sunshine by reel big,fish it reminds me of warped tour with dylan kelly and i do n't remember who else went but it probably was n't that important oh it was ronnie now it 's going to be me dylan paul patrick jon joe and james and nick all going to static x,"and staind in october , i 'm really excited about it but kinda scared i 'm walking on sunshine my feet hurt from the shoes i was wearing today i love them , they 're converse sneakers so cute and they look like they would be comfortable but they 're",really not which is kinda disappointing rambling like this makes me feel like anne hathaway on princes diareis which makes me think of her in the other side of heaven which is one of my favorite movies nicole and i watched josie and the pussycats last week at some point,"in time i wonder what mark will think once i tell him that i have a date if i even bother to tell him i already told ward , i think that ward may like me but probably not and do n't it feel good ?","i dig this song , we sang it in choir in sixth grade which brings back memories of casey and how we were the best of friends up until a stupid boy came between us i can hear the air conditioner going and the clicking of nicole 's mouse she",is doing a cog lab for some reason she is upset that she scored against the norm on it i think that she is really smart and am glad that she and i are roomies it was weird though cause i was in here while she and greg her boyfriend,were cuddling she has a question for me but ca n't remember it i suppose i 'll pay attention she did an experiment and has to print it out and it has to be the final name it seems like it should be daniell instead of nicole wow it 's,only been seven minutes and i 'm running out of things to think about well if it 's saved under that name um perhaps you should talk to greg about it i think she is oops i did n't realize she was on the phone i miss dancing and am,kinda nervous about trying out for the roustabouts i think they 're called my hair is tickling my nose i wish that i 'd never had bangs to begin with it seems like such a hassle to take care of them and it 's taking so long to grow them,out nicole is trying to get greg to help her with her computer stuff over the phone he will probably end up coming up here and then i 'll have to go down and hang out with ward and mark in my pjs to avoid feeling awkward if nicole and,greg start getting touchy feely i think that he is going to come up i 'm glad that they 've worked everything out now but it kinda makes me depressed because i do n't really have anybody and paul is being a big poo head which is his new name,poo head paul .,i wonder if punctuation and capitalization and spelling count in this probably not because it 's not like humans think using punctuation or caps i like the punk version of this song punk rock princes by something corporate dylan went to see them with 311 last week i wish that,i hyad gone now but i have n't even started my biology questions yet and i 'm afraid of failing the course and am considering dropping it my tailbone kinda hurts from sitting here so long i do n't think that i want to be on aim when paul gets,back i should leave a message up on friday saying that i 've gone on a date it should pose for some interesting conversation with him later on that 's for sure geez 12 minutes that means that i 've still got 8 to go my alarm should go off,when it 's been that long my laundry is probably already done i 'm glad nicole showed me how because i had neglected it for so long we talked to a cool guy in there but i forgot what his name was he was a business major though i wonder,what the weather would be like tomorrow hah nicole said anal and she is talking about laura vasquez a girl from our old high school i think i saw ben campos in my psych class today but it 's been so long since i 've seen him and think that,"i keep seeing people who are n't really the people i 'm thinking of so it might not have been him i really would not like to see any of them though i came up here to get away from them but oh well , c'est la vie and cool",sheep tiffany laughed at that phrase earlier i just do n't like beans enough to say cool beans sheep are so much better i feel like a child babbling on and on to an uncaring adult and my time is almost up so that 's a good thing i think,i 've already been through four sogs already nicole 's kinda computer illiterate though she did learn how to download stuff from her camera to computer which is more than i can probably figure out i 'm thinking about my psych class now and the huge screens used to project,the stuff i expected everything to be without overheads or any sort of indication on what we should write down it being all us and sucks for us if we do n't know what to study for the test i really should do my biology but i 'm not in,the mood i keep saying that i 'll do it later but honestly it wo n't get done i think that i say the word honestly too often and i make too many typos when i type i really like my laptop keyboard though the keys are nice and compact,and make cool noises when you press them rather than nicole 's chunky computer keyboard but what would you give away to have somewhere to go to i do n't think that i would give up everything for just one other person though the bible says so which reminds me,that i should probably e-mail my bible study instructor christie later on tonight just to let her know what is going on her kids go to school in austin jon and katie they 're really cute christie and her husband got divorced a while ago and it seems like a,horrible thing that they went through i do n't really want to ask her about it though cause it 's not my business and it seems like a touchy subject which brings to mind richard who called paul a dick after i told him that paul had told me that,he kissed jade i think i 'm getting better at accepting the fact that they 're together at least it 's easier to do up here than in nb it seems that the further away from my problems i am the easier they become to handle i wonder how many, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i have too much homework to do .,it is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours .,the homework in ut requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time .,"also , at ut , you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management .","also , there are a lot of distractions like girls , basketball , sleep , etc .",going to early classes has been hard for me so far .,it is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it .,"i think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about , or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand .","this is because once you are lost , you really do n't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed .",i really think that my gpa is important this semester becuase i am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science .,"this is becuase i do not like computer science which is my current major , and business seems easier and a better track to go .",today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection .,it kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student 's number really was .,i want my parents to bring me a bike to ut .,it is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes .,"but i kind of do n't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair , you will have to pedal over hills , and cars do n't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians .",i am kind of pissed that the school is closing gregory gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party .,i think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night .,plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too .,i really think that the ut football team is going to do well this year .,"although they blew a big first game , i think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year .",i do n't understand why chris simms chose to come to texas over tennessee .,he is such a good quarterback to be a backup .,i think he should be starting over major applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic .,i really do n't like to do these things because it takes so much time .,"when i first started typing i did n't realize how long 20 minutes is , but it is a long time .","when i finish this , i need to start on my english paper , and do my calculus problems .",my calculus ta is really stupid because she can not teach us .,"she skips too many steps , and she ca n't explain problems very well .",i think that radio stations should not have morning shows .,"this is because i was listening to a radio station in the morning that did n't use to have a morning show because they were new , but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music .","also , they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to .",i like it when it rains .,but here in austin is never seems to rain .,i 've been here for 2 1 ' 2 weeks now and not a drop of rain .,when it rains i feel better for some reason .,tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because i do n't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon .,and all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you do n't learn anything .,i like a girl here are ut but i do n't know if she likes me back .,but i am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to emory in atlanta .,the girl that i like in ut though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that i am there .,she also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous .,"the girl in emory is a girl that i 've known for 4 years and i think i stand a better chance with her , but i hear that long distance realtionships never work out .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

last night i was almost done and my computer just shut off .,i do n't really understand why but oh well .,"i do n't usually understand computer stuff , or any technical stuff in general .",i hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that i can be totally done with mis before tomorrow i think that i am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least i think that lucy will be a good academic influence on,me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie did n't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally i will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy i still ca,n't believe that i did n't catch mono from angie last year i have a sore throat now i hope that it goes away soon i do n't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th3ey are going out have to take blood,and that really freaks me out i ca n't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be,"really hard and busy i think i thin k all of my classes will be really interesting , but difficult i am so glad that i was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some",teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but i know that that class would n't have been easy it was such a pain to add'drop though i am so glad that it is done next weekend,is the first football game i am looking forward to it i am glad that billy and i got season tickets so that i do n't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the ou tickets i doubt that,"i will end up going to the a and m game because i bet i will stay home for thanksgiving well , billy can invite one of this friends to go with him i ca n't believe that he would n't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his",mom is going to be very unhappy with him i am getting really hungry i wonder what we will do for dinner i wish that billy and i could get together but we are not on the best terms right now i ca n't believe that we got in such,a big fight last night maybe we were just tired i hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and jeff to come over last night sometimes i miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together,"i am glad that cindy and eric get to be together again , but i hope that they are prepared for what 's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in i am kind",of getting a little homesick i am anxious to see lauren 's new car i ca n't believe that she is really turning sixteen i am really afraid for her to drive so i hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good,"driving experience she really could use the practice i am anxious to see dads ' new office space too i hope that he is a little less stressed i know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him , but i am glad that steve",a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees i know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but i know that she really is glad that he is not going out minneapolis a lot that was getting really old,"it was nice to see meredith this weekend it is so weird being i 'm the same city as her again i wish tat i could have gotten to see brad too , but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the","party on wednesday night , but i understand they both still seem pretty immature and i am kind of worried about meredith and i hope that she is careful .",i am glad that she found a date for the date dash i ca n't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that 's pat for you i hope that they all have a fun year and,i hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing ashley this weekend too her room at the house is really nice i think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not,have to do the community thing i am glad that lucy and i are going to go on a walk i could really use the exercise i am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow i really need too get back in shape i felt so good about myself last,year when i was going to aerobics everyday i need to get back in that mode i do n't think that i really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now .,i seem to not be snacking as much as i did last year which is a very good thing i hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it has n't been very good lately but i think that it will get better i hope that billy,calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard i guess that he wo n't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that 's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more,things to keep talking about i think that i might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again i hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but i 'm afraid that i would never get them since there is no real apartment,address or anything i 'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it i hope that amy and meredith had a good time with their boys this weekend i will go down later and see i have a lot of fun,with them we are really similar in a lot of ways i am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun i wonder where lucy and i will walk too we need to somehow walk by the,coop i hope that it is not too hot outside when i went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot i think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler i am anxious for it to cool down,it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building i was so disgusting by the time i got back form class mondays and wednesdays are going to be long now that i go from one to five but tuesdays and thursdays will be pretty,easy except this tuesday i have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks i wonder why all the good shows start again i ca n't wait to see the friends season premier and 90210 i am so excited this year should be very good well i am, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i am at work right now .,"i guess i 'm a little hesitant about writing this stream of consciousness , because we never do this in school .","we 're always asked to write on a specific topic or something of that sort , and to write what we think is such a broad topic .","i 'm sick , and i do n't think its because of those freshman jitters you were talking about .",i was completely confident in going to school .,"nonetheless , i got sick .",my parents say its because i do n't have enough sleep or because the dorms have diseases .,"i do n't live in the dorm , though , which is both a plus and a bad thing .","i like living off campus , because it feels more homey and seems like there 's a place to get away from school .","then again , a lot of my friends live on campus so i do n't necessarily get to hang out with them a lot .","its ok though , because they always try to include me .","yesterday , i studied at pcl until midnight and my friend was so worried about me walking home alone that she made these two guys walk home with us .","i have bad congestion and my mind seems like its under a lot of pressure , so if i do n't make sense , that is probably why .","i 'm listening to music which seems kind of girly and i feel that the guy i work with might think it is too , but he has n't said anything .","no matter what i do , i like to have music on .","when i sleep , when i study .","its a habit , i guess .",the main thing i have on my mind is successively passing my classes .,i have no doubt that i will pass .,but passing with a 's is another thing .,"i am one of those girls who went through all 12 years of basic schooling with all a 's , and have never had a problem with being behind in class or even worrying about getting a b. it might seem like the work of a perfectionist , but i",was n't always the most studious .,i 'm quite the procrastinator .,"ever since i started college , however , it seems like i 've had quite an interest in my classes and studying .","of course , there 's the occasional partying , but it seems like college is an experience to do what you want to do .",i like to study and learn and feel as if i 've accomplished something on my own will .,its like reading .,"when i was little , i used to read a lot !","as school started , they always made us read books , so i lost interest in the joy of reading willingly .","this past summer , i read uncle tom 's cabin and it was wonderful .",it was probably the first book i read on my own for awhile .,"when there 's studying to do , and organizations to participate in , there 's no time for leisure time like reading or watching tv .",that is one thing i 'm proud of since i 've gotten here .,i have n't watched much tv .,"i wish i was more of a news-person , but the news just does n't catch my interest all that much .",its like everyday there 's another child missing or a new statistic that everyone is obese .,i guess shows like dateline or 20'20 that show the in-depth look at stories are more my style .,"we were told a story in mythology about how people used to have four legs and four arms and two heads , and it was like they were connected by their backs .","well , these 'people ' became overly arrogant and so the gods decided to split the two in half so there would be more of them and they would be more efficient , and they would n't gloat so much .","then they scattered the halves all around the world , and that is why we go around searching for our other half .",i like this story so much because i 'm a romantic .,hopeless romantic is more the term i would use to describe myself .,even though i 've been wonderfully single for 18 years .,there 's this hope that there will be a special someone i will have sparks with and this higher connection to .,"i do n't know if i 've watched too many movies or have too many daydreams , but i guess i 'm like most girls searching for their prince charming .","sometimes i look into the atrological signs , of which i am a virgo .",it usually always says that virgos get bored quickly .,"i think that in a way , i am that way .","its horrible to say , but i think i 'll tire of someone quickly if they do n't keep my interest .","of course , i like to keep everyone as friends , but romantically speaking , there has to be something different about a person .","there 's a song by ashanti that goes , ' i want to be like those girls in the movies , have a guy fall hopelessly in love with me .","' now , that seems kind of selfish , but to know that a guy really cares about you and would sacrifice many things for you is a really different characteristic .",guys nowadays are so un-chivalrous .,"i feel like a little boy-crazy girl right now , but my friend had mentioned that i should talk about this in my writing and i guess it kind of stuck .","fortunately , i 'm completely content with my life and i feel that i have a lot going for me .","i am not at all ashamed of being single , but there 's always those people who ask why there 's no guy in my life .",what do i say to them ?,i love being single .,"there 's those girls who go blind by love , and i hope to never lose myself in the process of loving someone else .",its crazy ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

let 's see .,i 'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone .,this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back .,"not that she 's not a cool person or anything , i just can concentrate better when i 'm alone and when it is quiet .",but that is almost impossibe here in jester .,there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises .,like right now !,"oh well , it is something i must get used to .",or i can do what i did last night .,wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done .,i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night .,my fingers are freezing !,this room is so cold !,"i have n't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room , it is insane .",i 'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket .,i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i can not wear shorts like i used to back at home .,"aw , home !",i think i am starting to miss being at home .,i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me .,"this , ladies and gentlemen , is something that never occurs .","i do go back home on thursday night , but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta .",i am competing in a sports tournament for my church .,i am playing flag football and running track .,another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i 've been dating for less than a month .,"well , i 've known him for about 4 years , but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children 's camp for my church together .","it 's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that , but only because i did n't want to be mean .",he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me .,"that was always an issue for me before , but for some reason , i really do n't care anymore .",he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met .,i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago .,"me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college , we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend .","a week after we broke things off , this new guy i 'm dating told me he had feelings for me .",i was so confused and did n't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks .,but i 'm normally the uptight girl that ca n't let loose and enjoy myself .,"because of that , i decided that i 'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy .",we decided we 'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves .,my ex found out and was extremely jealous .,it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy .,"but oh well , that 's life i guess .","i am really glad i continued to see this other guy , regardless of what my ex had to say .",i spent every day with him until the day i left .,i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much .,he is amazing .,the only thing i 'm worried about is that i 'll fall too hard and too quickly for him .,i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i do n't think i 'm quite ready for another one .,that 's the only problem i 'm having right now .,the fact that he 's a high school student does not bug me as it used to .,but the distance might become an issue .,"it was an issue in a way for me and my ex , so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i 'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex .",but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me .,"but yeah , that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut .",but i am definitely loving it here in austin .,i enjoy all of my professors and classes .,"having two biology classes and a chemistry class , however , can be tough .","in addition i am taking this psychology class , which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting .","other than that i have my freshman seminar class , which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations .",i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment .,"ah , my hands are still so cold .",what do i do ?,my ears are feeling very cold too .,must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room ?,"or my bad , it is the fall now .",same thing .,today is the day for my mile run .,"ever since i moved to austin , i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym .",i absolutely love that place !,and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester .,freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape !,i find that i 've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer .,i really love this lifestyle i have at ut .,"the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming , but i do not feel like i am abusing it .","i did party a lot this weekend , but i did n't drink or anything .",people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset .,i do n't want people to view me as a party girl because i 'm not out of control or anything .,oh well .,i see that this writing is almost up .,that was n't too bad !, , , , , ,

ok here goes i am starting to write for my psych class and i have just switched my roommate .,she hated the three of us and i do n't really understand as to why .,"well , actually i can because we did talk alot of smack about her but we gave her a chance and she never would reciprocate .",so my new roommate is in the process of getting situated right now as i type and i wonder what she thinks about me .,she seems pretty cool and i hope she is going to be the kind of roommate i was looking for all along .,i really miss my boyfriend .,he is working and i wonder if he is thinking about me at the same time as i do .,i hope he will call soon for i know he will but hopefully not right now because i am in the middle of writing for twenty minutes straight .,i just started thinking about how i took a class over the summer on writing .,that was weird .,"anyway , ozzy ozbourne is on his show right now on mtv and i remember how my dad didnt think it was very appropriate that i watch the show when it first came out .","that reminds me , i am upset since he doesnt think that it is appropriate for my boyfriend joe to come and stay with me until he has a place .",i went to walmart today and was getting so frustrated with all the mexican people who were crawling all over the place .,it was ridiculous .,i wonder what my suitemates are laughing about .,this sucks having to right this im telling my roomates about this project thing right now .,it is for psychology .,man my fart smells .,i need to take a shower and dump .,thanks for getting my new table .,umm ya my lava lamp is purple and clear .,shutup erica .,hi lerrin .,joe is hot says erica .,my parents can suck it if he stays .,i wonder what they would say if they knew that trey had stayed with us for a week since he can not find a place in austin .,"he goes to southwest and i think the people there are incredibly nice , despite what some say .",i dread having to read two chapters in chemistry but i know i will do it for i am the determined driven type .,the ozzy show cusses more than i do which i think is incredibly weird .,i almost threw out arielle 's shit today because she made me go through the whole ordeal of moving in again and my mom thought i was pissed at her but i was just upset in general .,joe suggested that i throw her shit out in the hall because she was being such a bitch .,i wonder if i can cuss on this assignment ?,well if not i apologize for my french .,some la madeline 's sounds really good right about now .,i shouldnt be eating so much because you know what they say- freshman fifteen !,erica keeps bothering me about writing this thing i have to fart again .,i want to go eat some pringles and ranch dip but then i will feel fat and probably be even more gaseous than already stated .,do you ever wonder if people talk technically so they feel smarter as well as to sound smart .,why do such people need to feel that way .,just go through life doing your own thing and not worry about what others think because in the long run all of that will be forgotten .,by lerrin .,whats the point becuase the things that matter are all you will remember when you are dying in your bed when you are approximately eighty years old .,my biggest fear is that of dying .,sometimes i lay at night and wonder what it would feel like not to breathe and that is the scariest thing to me .,i hope that i go fast or in my sleep so i do n't know that i am consiously dying .,did i spell that right ?,well im too lazy to go back and change it anyways if it was spelled wrong .,i am so happy i finally got my glasses in the mail because my eyes are just dying and i know that i havent been taking good care of them .,sometimes i just think that i will get that laser surgery and i use that as my reasoning to my lack of nurture to them now .,i wish my best friend amy would call me .,i knew that i would be replaced but i didnt think it would be so soon .,i know soccer is a tough schedule at st eds but she doesnt even make an effort to call anymore but i am part to blame as well .,im glad no one is instant messaging me right now because that would suck because i wouldnt be able to talk to them .,stop interrupting me ashley and stop trying to be cool with kirby because she will figure you out quick and decide if she wants to make you her business .,but thanks for running to walmart for me and im sorry i complained all day but its probably because i am on pms time right now .,i wonder who is going to read these and what the real purpose is or even if you really do read this .,i has made me feel better and calmer that i am typing about what i am feeling and thinking .,i am worried about money and my financial situation right now .,kirby says we are normal .,i think she is really pretty and skinny .,i am going to have alot of fun with her .,but i hope that i do n't get carried away too much because school is my number one priority .,i need to get a job and i would be much happier .,i do n't even have enough for tuition next semester and my parents said they would help but they backed out and i have great resentment for that .,i am tempted to ask my older brother but because i am

wow i ca n't believe i waited this long to write this paper .,i was in a shock when i found out that this was due tomorrow .,deadlines motivate me more than ever .,i told myself that i was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but i guess getting it done is what is most important .,i just played some starcraft with my roommate .,i used to play this game with all my friends from school before war craft iii came out for the computer .,this game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework .,i 'd have to say this game was the devil .,it made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game .,i told them i would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting .,my parents somehow figured out that i started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out .,this was n't a very good feeling .,"well , anyway , this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago .","somehow , all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time .",this was extremely strange because i did n't tell anybody about this news .,i tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions .,this aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak .,a few friends from houston already know .,"i mean , what 's the big deal .",i do n't understand why gossip can travel so fast .,i guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people 's lives .,i think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others .,i find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be `` what 's up '' .,the basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person 's life .,this type of conversation does n't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong .,figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing .,you never know who 's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person .,i figured my actions did n't speak that loud .,but any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other .,it immediately captures the center of attention .,i think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are .,this is not an easy task .,starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes .,"changes in friendship , responsibility and so on .",college is a good way of determining who your real friends are .,these are truly hard to find .,i knew this girl that had about 3 parties a year .,there would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company .,but one time at lunch i saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too .,it 's crazy how things can turn right around like that .,well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not .,my friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and i think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship .,"we hardly ever talk about serious matters , so this was refreshing to me .",i hang out with a bunch of guys that are n't really open to their feelings .,we seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we 're just buddies .,"i mean we 'll be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking , especially about relationships .",we 'd always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not .,i always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt .,but this was never the case .,three out of the four guys go to school here in austin but the fourth person is in san antonio .,i can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends .,everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but i feel obliged to back him up .,i know it 's all in fun but after a while i think it 's just mean .,i miss the guy too .,i hope he makes it to austin next year .,

"if i were to fly to pennsylvania to see julia , brint and i would have to go together , it 'd cost a hell of a lot but maybe for spring break or something we could go .","she says it 's really pretty up there , it gets really cold too .",i hate the cold weather .,"i have an image in my head of these nice clean streets , kind of hilly , in autumn with all the leaves changing colors and falling on the ground .","she says it 's supposed to be beautiful , like a carpet .",and we 'd go see vicky in philly .,"though we 'd have to take the train , all sorts of new stuff .",but i wo n't get to see her until christmas and i know i wo n't be able to go before that .,she 's going to disney world before christmas so i wo n't even get to see her much then either .,i 've never been to disney world or disneyland or anything .,all i want is some of those mickey mouse ears and to ride the teacup ride .,i told cassandra in eighth grade or our freshman year or something that when she went to get me some and i 'd pay her back but she never got them .,i wish we still would have been friends just a little more in high school .,i mean i realize that the whole little group broke up when we got to high school but still .,i really wish i was still good friends with andrea .,i miss her so much sometimes .,"she 's dating some guy now that i do n't even know , i did n't even know she was dating someone .","we used to be such good friends , inseparable .",i practically lived at her house an entire summer and we did everything together .,then i left her and she went off and became `` popular '' or whatever .,which pisses me off because i when we got to high school she was fat and not that pretty and now all of a sudden she 's miss beauty queen and she 's too good to hang out with me .,not that we would have anything in common these days and i guess it is my own fault for the way things went .,but i just wish i would have gotten to share some of those high school things with her .,i miss her so much .,"it 's really weird because i have all these best friends , like 5 or 8 and its not like i ever thought about her much in high school .","every once in a while , but now that i 'm here it seems that i miss her more , i have n't really thought about her any more than normal i guess .","although right before i left , for a couple of days i thought about her a lot and i really wanted to email her a letter of some sort , kind of apologizing i guess for the way things went between us .","they did n't go bad or anything , they just kind of went away .",i think i still might email her .,the reason behind it all is jeremy .,i talked to him the other day and it was weird .,like it did n't feel weird at the time but now that i look back and think it was just weird .,i 'd really like to see him again sometime soon .,i do n't know why because i know it probably wo n't be good for me .,things are strange because if i 'm not around him for a while i 'll think about him and in an odd way miss him .,but the second i get around him i suddenly realize why the hell i hate him so much and why i ca n't stand to be around him .,i 'm sure i have some underlying issues with all that that i just ca n't define or pick out .,"well i know i do , i dated the damn guy for three years of my life .",three years of high school no less .,my first real experiences are all owed to him .,"now that i look at it , it was probably a really bad idea , in know it was , to date him all while i 'm just being introduced to things in the world .","those are things i should have experienced on my own , not with him in my life .","and plus i wasted 3 years of my life , there 's no telling who or what would have happened in those three years .",or who i would have become .,"which is the other aspect of it , i 'm not sure which side i agree with more .",because if it were n't for him i would n't be who i am today and i think for the most part i like who i am .,and i had all these experiences with him and i learned so much and it just makes you wonder what would have happened and how would i have turned out if i had n't dated him .,"i mean i 'm glad i have all these experiences under my belt because i sure as hell would n't have wanted to come here without knowing a lot of the things i do , and i 'm glad they were with somebody i `` loved '' .","but it just really gets to me to think , what if .",i 'm so curious to know how things would have gone if it were n't for him .,and now i 'm even starting to doubt my love for him .,was i really in love or was i just fooled somehow ?,"i 'm sure i loved him as a person , and now i 'm even starting to wonder about that too .","maybe it 's just the suppressed anger or whatever that makes me doubt my feelings for him , or maybe i just honestly did n't .",but i was obviously feeling something at the time .,and last time is so much different than this time .,that 's what brought on the whole questioning thing of

"i really need to study for chemistry , but i just remembered that this assignment was due .","i would have done it earlier , but my computer has been giving me so many problems .",first all these warnings about `` you have spyware and adware '' started coming up and then it started working really slow -- it took 15 minutes to open up the internet !,then after a while it would n't even do that -- it just sat there !,"so i tried to shut it down and it still did n't do anything -- but if i tried to start a program , it said `` this program can not open because the system is shutting down. `` so i unplugged it and let the battery run out .",computers are so stupid .,but i guess we could n't live without them .,i really hope i do n't fail this chemistry test tomorrow .,i 'm really nervous because it 's my first real college test and it 's also over some stuff that i do n't completely understand .,"my roommate is in the same class as me , but she 's at the pcl -- she calls it her home because she 's there every minute of every day -- i do n't know how she does it !",studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like i need a break -- she stays there for hours !,she 's really sweet though .,i so happy i got good roommates ( yes -- that 's plural -- i have 3 roommates -- i 'm in supplemental housing -- it 's not as bad as i thought it would be ) 2 of my roommates are really nice .,"the other one is kind of weird , but she 's hardly ever here -- she 's always at her boyfriend 's house .",that 's kind of rude to her parents though -- i mean -- they 're paying for her food and housing and she 's not even sleeping here .,the only thing i know about her is her name really .,that 's okay though -- at least she 's not using my computer all the time anymore .,when we first moved in she did n't have a ethernet cord so i said she could do her add'drops on my pc .,but then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes ( on my printer -- with my ink ) so at least that 's not happening any more .,andy roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the us open tonight .,that made me so sad -- i love andy roddick -- he has to be the sexiest guy ever !,i met him last year and the tennis masters series in houston and he signed my shirt -- me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled out andy -- he and his coach really liked them !,but i really wanted him to win -- he won the open last year and that was his first so i really wanted him to defend it .,oh well .,the guy he lost to was playing really good .,he played the same type of game as andy though .,"they were calling him a swedish andy roddick , but he 'll never be andy roddick -- he was n't cute enough .",chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester .,i 'm not really sure if i want to major in biology any more .,i think it might just be too much science for me .,"i thought i could handle it , but i just do n't know anymore .","i know majoring in biology will probably help me make a good score on the mcat , though .",i really want to get into med school .,i want to be a pediatrician .,it 's just so much school though .,oy !,but i think it 'll pay off .,i really want to do something with kids and i could do that and make money at the same time .,i mean -- it 's that or teaching right ?,and teaching is definitely not on my list of things i want to do .,my mom is a teacher and they do n't get paid half of what they deserve !,she works all the time -- sometimes she does n't come home until after midnight -- and she only works with 5th and 6th graders .,i mean --

understand how on earth he can simply think that just because he 's been on medications and is immune and he 's sick and is in pain that that is a valid excuse .,"we all have our issues to escape from

it .","he knows it was wrong , i honestly think he knows its wrong and he claims he regrets it but deep down i do n't think he does .",this is his rebellion .,what kills it the most is that it shows just how hypocritical he can be .,maybe a year ago he was bashing one of his really good friends for doing something so similar .,"the guilt trips , the icq away messages , the finger pointing .",its all the same .,"i know thats what scares brad so much about it , because michael is his best friend , and he ca n't stand to see him turn into benny .",neither can i. i 've known one too many people

room , bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator ; everyone munches from it .",and it 's ok. the ra told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking ; she called her mom and was so upset .,i 'm so glad its not like that here .,we all contribute and all consume .,but it 's not like there 's always noise and party 's here .,only when we all decide .,"if one person wants to read or study or sleep , we 're really considerate .","i hope that lasts , i 'm pretty sure it will .","at our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because , come on , who minds a foreign accent every once in a while .","this guy from belgium and this one from england are always watching tv in our room , which is another amusing thing : we do n't have cable , or an antenna , or a vcr , so we only get fox channel 7. we sit around and watch whatever",'s on .,in one way it 's good because we do n't have arguments over which channel to watch .,maybe simplicity is the root of compromise .,we had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up .,it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room 's shananagans .,"this one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry ( he 's one of our friends- our referring to my

which is down the hall and around a corner .,we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us .,now we have a nice couch that is well used and the ra 's are threatening to do a room check to find it .,why ?,its going to more use .,it 's all kind of a double standard anyway .,the head ra is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer .,he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and wo n't mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night .,"it 's pretty funny , one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint .",we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head ra stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded .,it probably would n't have been in his best interests to b seen in there .,"he 's only 20 , but the building is

i wish travis would stop switching channels on the tv .,actually i wish my internet was hooked up already .,then i would n't have to be over here in his getto room .,granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help .,or maybe its just because he is a boy .,i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms .,but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm .,maybe my expectations are too high .,i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt ' be here at ut .,i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college .,so in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high .,it keeps me interested in whats going on .,"ok so travis is talking to the tv , now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me .",for a 19 year old i would n't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning .,i mean he was the validictorian of my class should n't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature ?,i dunno .,i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends .,im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him .,he does n't come off as the straightest guy you 've ever met .,infact he does n't come of as straight at all .,although he claims he only likes gals .,i do n't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out .,in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school .,he was n't good at it either but the school couldnt ' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they did n't let him in .,so they did .,but then when he was n't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really did n't go to his straightness accredation .,but i know one day he will just be like kendra im gay and i 'll be like i know its about time and then life will continue just as it always has .,ha reading rainbow is on .,i have n't watched that show in forever .,i did n't even know it was still showing .,i knew mr. rogers retired .,i grew up on that show .,i grew up on all of pbs .,i was really big into it and my younger brother just was n't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles .,he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs .,he didnt ' learn to read as fast either .,im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his alone time with mom .,but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he 's in high school too .,i think its just too funny .,now mom 's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she wo n't get bored .,i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i 've been locking the doors before i go to sleep .,i almost feel bad for him .,almost .,except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job .,i never asked for money like he does .,i ca n't understand where his money goes either .,he does n't go anywhere he ca n't drive .,but still he has no money ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.600765 -0.226722 0.288198 0.0038 -0.012233 1.619162 -0.737244 -0.750137 -0.389211 0.189604 -0.155623 -0.303522 -0.299211 0.027207 -0.453259 0.0 -0.04277 0.819875 -1.285228 -0.795527 -1.570244 -0.525469 4.198267 -0.889702 0.381778 -0.386211 0.558637 -0.662075 -1.568163 -0.909687 -0.442314 -0.788316 -1.275466 -0.906028 -0.753383 -0.40643 -0.310686 -0.796767 -0.140781 0.298415 0.025301 0.385608 0.911598 0.34048 1.877563 -0.30229 -0.522178 1.9661 -0.610887 2.806531 0.30169 0.524043 0.188231 -1.071247 0.681365 0.586608 1.66016 -0.359539 0.251015 -0.433484 0.708121 -1.035766 -0.480161 -0.362261 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.058372 -1.297083 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.349664 -0.37208 0.064257 -0.422267 0.490649 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.652694 5.174144 3.198047 5.023906 4.914641 4.824162,1665

well i guess i can start with my dream last night since that is what i 've been thinking about all day .,it was so crazy .,i had a dream that i was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door .,"i open the door and it is a dark figure , like a person , but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in .",well she walks i and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear .,i do n't know what she was saying but at that point i wake up in my dream as i 'm struggling to move my body .,"i could n't move until i realized i was out of my dream , which was maybe 3 seconds later .",how creepy is that .,when i woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then i completely forgot it .,i do n't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me .,i 've felt ghosts before but i never felt a bad sense coming from them .,weird .,i always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean .,i mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us ?,i am a little worried about that but i have n't really been a bad person in the past with anyone .,that i can think of .,oh well .,anyways i have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if i want to enjoy the weekend like i should .,hopefully i will be studying on the beach saturday night .,not that the south padre beach ids that beautiful .,after going to cancun for a week though i guess its hard to actually top that beach .,that was the best time i believe in my life so far .,it is good to know that i will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip .,saving the money was super hard but i feel like if i really want to do something i am capable of making that happen .,i hope this weekend is as good as last weekend .,i am going back to san antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit .,i really love the night life over here though .,maybe because everything is so new over here and i really love change period .,i am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter .,i came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city .,now i know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale .,i really miss my best friend a lot though .,"her and i hung out all summer together , and all last year in school for that matter .",she was all i needed and i was the same for her .,now we are spirited and she 's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children .,its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time .,her relationship with that boy is so lame .,thank god i have no time for stuff like that right now .,i can not relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time .,hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her .,man .,this is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer .,everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much i am typing .,"they keep staring at me , then the screen and back to me .",hahahahahahaha !,lets see well i 've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find .,but unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal .,this life sciences library is really nice .,i think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here .,there are always open computers in here as well .,well my time is almost up .,my experience in the psy class is very important to me considering i want to be a psychiatrist one day ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

this is weird and different .,i 'm not exactly sure what i should be writing .,i really love it when guys can play the guitar .,i do n't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness .,"i hope , oh i forgot what i was going to say .",that happens a lot .,twenty minutes seems like a long time .,"anyway , i 'm listening to hotel california by the eagles and then i think i 'm going to listen to my sublime cd .",the beatles were like musical geniuses .,i bet them and frank sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women .,i would have had sex with frank sinatra back in the day .,i made a list of celebrities i would have no problems having sex with- it is n't very long but i 'll share it because i really do n't care .,"it 's not like i 'll ever have sex with these people anyway let 's see it was lindsay lohan , michael vartan , john mayer , and jake gyllenhaal .",i bet john mayer is an excellent lover .,no one who plays the guitar ( and sings wonderful love songs ) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover .,"huh , i do n't think that made sense , it made sense in my head .",i 'm so glad stephie is my roommate .,we have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well .,sex and the city is such an awesome show .,i think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them .,is it bad that sometimes i want to push my morals aside and do things i know are `` wrong '' .,since i 've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style .,i hate that they judge me .,why ca n't i just live my life the way i want to ?,being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things i 've ever done but now that i 'm doing things that the church would n't approve of i 'm noticing that i 'm pushing everything i used to stand for aside so that,i can `` experiment '' with different things .,"i do n't regret anything i do , but sometimes i do n't think i make the best decisions .",i 'm happy though and i guess that 's all that matters .,i 'm sure god is an understanding god .,i 'm not sure what 's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life .,sounds like a lose lose situation to me .,i really need to lose some weight man .,i was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210. so now she weighs .,137. wow .,i need to lose that much weight .,i wonder how she did it .,i should have asked her .,some days i 'll feel really self confident and pretty and i 'm like well i guess i love myself the way i am so someone will love me for me as well .,"then other days i 'm like `` fuck , who 's going to love a fat slob '' .",i hope i meet the one in college .,i hope he 's amazing in every way .,is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate ?,that would be sweet .,first things first though .,i need to shed the pounds asap .,yes .,after this i have to study italian .,that 's going to suck .,i probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away .,oh well .,this week was a lot more productive then last .,so this weekend i plan to really catch up and get my shit together .,i really need to pull my gpa up .,i want to do good .,i 'm going to do good .,i just wish i were n't so damn lazy .,bah .,i wish i were going to college station tomorrow .,i want to see my old friends but i do n't know why if they 're just going to look at me like i 'm the devil .,my leg is still twitching .,that probably is n't a good thing .,i 'm sad pookie 's leaving this weekend .,i wish i could find someone who enjoys my company as much as i enjoy theirs .,i miss chris so much .,i wish every time i was with him could be like that night after the john mayer concert .,he 's so much fun to be around .,i think i come off as bitchy and annoying but i 'm not sure .,i wish someone would tell me .,i have the beatles song `` black bird '' stuck in my head .,i want to take guitar lessons i just wish they were n't so damn expensive .,i 'm so glad i only have one class tomorrow !,yay !,i kind of do n't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better .,otherwise looks like i will be going to college station .,we 'll see how that works out ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

plus i am really staying on top of it .,the only concern that i am having at all is the size of my classes ( all of them have over 200 people in them ) because i am used to being in classes with about 15 people in them and recieving a lot of focused attention from my teachers,"and although i am not concerned about this affecting my performance as i feel that i am completely capable on my own , i am worried i will be overlooked and just be a number in crowd -

throughout my life i have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future .,"for example , when first arriving at ut i was awe-inspired by the size of the campus , and the enormous amounts of students which attended .",i was shocked by the different races which represented each other .,"i could tell that everyone was already forming their own little `` clicks '' , whether it was based on their interests in music , race , sex , sexual orientation , everyone was already making new friends , and social gathering were taking place .","while everyone was socializing i was busy worrying about the classes that i was taking , the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that i had .","i was lonely , i was scared , and being from a large city , i was trying to adapt to an even larger one .","although ut is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things , for example , the opposite sex , new friends , and just having a good time , while at the same time , studying .","i knew coming to ut that i would have a good education , but i needed a way to find myself , who i was , and what i wanted to study , i came to ut wanting to be a doctor , but i figured that it may not",be something i wanted to do .,"perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy , at some time in my college education , but whatever it is that i may become i want it to be something that i am going to be happy doing .",i realized that high school is much different that college .,"college is much more demanding , and time consuming .",but in the end it will even out someday .,when i was a child i had dreams of being a great military leader .,a policeman .,a astronaut .,or a physicist .,as of now i do n't know what i want to become i 'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly .,as a child i always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why i wanted to become a doctor .,but now that i 'm in psychology i 've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind .,but how it works and functions .,in science i have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others .,"for example in psychology , it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression .","or just find a way to make everyone happy , in the event that i would someday accomplish something like this , i would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle .",knowing that i have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day .,now that i am more relaxed here at ut it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster .,finding the shortcuts .,and finding which classes are the best .,all the time when i first discovered what comes along with a great education .,i have also figured out that i can become whatever i want to be .,just as long as i put my mind to it .,and test out my skills as a academian .,coming to ut i knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me .,i knew that with hard work and determination .,i could accomplish whatever i wanted to .,conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine .,"overpowering myself , knowing that i ca n't always tell myself what to do all the time .",and just let my unconscious mind take over .,often times when i become depressed i find that it is easier to listen to soothing music .,talking with a friend .,or playing chess with a friend .,or playing cards with them .,at times i just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily .,when i do find myself depressed i always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind .,and think about other things .,such as playing basketball .,playing baseball .,or like i said playing a good game of chess with my friends .,i havent quite yet found my niche at ut but it will come someday .,and i too will find my interests in academics .,and find something that i truly love doing .,whether it be my major now .,such as biology or even psychology .,as a kid i remember pouring through my fathers materials .,because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments .,and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature .,all along i thought i always knew what i wanted to do when i got older but i guess its an answer i will learn in time ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today is good i do not have many classes i just have to get up to be in class by 930 and that really sucks i want to be with tiffany but i do n't know if i can trust her i think about her all the time and although,i am half to blame i do n't know if the break up is all because of me i triggered it but i do n't know if she wanted to break up or me break up more my andrew is working out okay he is in class it was good,that he only a friend no anything greater i mean like a best friend i can only imagine living with a best friend wanting to chop his head we would just argue about stupid stuff tiffany is so wrong i do n't understand anything when it comes to her i,know nothing was fair yet i wanted to believe it was what is wrong with me it is funny how things that are so important matter to no one else and although someone can have empathy they still do n't understand everything is different i want to know what to,do i know that is not possible it bothers me i need to do good in school i want to be someone who be comfortable i guess relying on money is what i have for now i just feel that i would be proud to support a family the way,i want them to be supported but will that affect the way they are going to be brought up i want to be a good father i want to do so much but i would do nothing if i could just have some answers if i could be certain for,once man i miss the old days but at the same time i do look towards the future i do think about how things will be different how i do n't know what the future holds and who knows it could be good or bad i learn either way i,feel i am learning a lot and changing that is what i love i want to change to a better person i guess better can only be what i hold as better not society so i guess what i am saying is that i want to be secure of myself,i want to be sure i know i can figure something out i know nothing is going to be easy about it and i do n't expect immediate results i just want to make something of myself but i want to have answers and i want to have love all,these things confuse me and make me feel alone i have to work on them it seems everything else is so trivial so pointless i do n't know though i have yet to figure out what i want my future foundations to be i am trying to be picky because,it is me i think society has some things wrong of course i mean it is democracy majority wins i do n't think the majority is always right although they do count for some things this topic just blows me away i mean why do people do drugs and alcohol,people have many different reasons i think if everyone can be responsible and do it to enjoy themselves if it possible i think it is okay i do n't know though i do n't really know anyone who can but i have n't thought much of the subject i mean,i particularly think that alcohol is worse then marijuana i know both are not good for your body i wonder if it therapeutic in any way though how they allow that temporary escape i know you should deal with your problems and not run and it is harmful to be,trapped by hiding in substance abuse but sometimes you things take time and maybe substance abuse can be used as therapeutic i do n't know maybe i am full of it sometimes i feel i know what i can handle i know there are limits to be set and i,feel i can exceed some i feel everyone has there own limits and i feel those people who can not respect there limits are the reason for the universal set of limits makes me kind of mad but that is okay of course it would happen but i wish the,limits i wish i could push sometimes could be understandable although i know they ca n't i know what they are and if i do n't that is how i find out so maybe it is n't so bad to push the limit you find out where you go overboard,and you can build from that and help others then again sometimes you are only one chance and sometimes it is only luck keeping you from screwing everything up when test limits i mean everyone test limits i just feel more respect for people who know there limits i would, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"today is september 10 , the day before our new monumental rememberence day of september 11th .",i sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the united states .,it is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we ca n't do anything about it .,i still remember like it was yesterday watching the september 11th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the united states .,i really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow .,now that i am a freshman at the university of texas things are beginging to change .,"for instance , my boyfriend and i are on a break , whatever that means .",he does n't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out .,he 's a junior at st. edwards university and has done the whole new college experience already .,it is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer .,i think it is that i really want to go out and meet new people .,"getting to know the girls at my dorm in kinsolving is really fun , and i like hanging out with them on the weekends .","of course this means going to parties with other boys there , and this does n't make my boyfriend very happy .","i can totally understand because i wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party , but i have to do the whole college experience right ?","well anyway now that we are broken up , i realize how much i miss him and how much i do n't want to end things .",it 's weird how when it 's time to go to sleep or study that is all i can think about .,"he 's so cute and perfect , i do n't know what i am screwing up .",it 's hard trying to balance your time here now that i am in college .,"there is always something to do , and i love that , but i need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track .","i guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult , and deadlines were not so final , as long as you could persuade the teacher .",college is a blast and i love my roomate .,she went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to baton rouge .,she still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could .,so then she made the right choice and came to ut and we ended up rooming together .,it 's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 1 in the morning to 2 in the morning .,"i really need to go to the gym today also because i do n't want to gain the freshman 15 , i reallly do n't want to go back home to lake jackson looking like a heffer !",so anyway i think i might go run after i finish writing .,another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here .,she got in to the summer ut program but decided to go to lsu instead .,"i miss her so much , we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close .",our boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time .,"me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up , so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly .",except now we 're having problems and we 're in the same town .,"my friend and her boyfriend are 8 hours away and doing great , funny how that works .",one good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty .,i love the hills and trees .,outside my dorm room window is hills and churches .,"yes , it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home .",another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 21 goes to swt so is only like 30 minutes away from me .,we have always been so close and i miss her lots .,i went down on laybor day with 3 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters .,it was really fun and i got to spend time with her .,"my mom is sad that i left for college , she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college .",i really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind .,all of my friends were leaving for school and i really didnt wnat to be the only one at home .,i am one out of four kids at home .,"my older sister is already off at swt , but then i have a 15 year old brother and a 11 year old sister .",i do n't think it is the same at home without me .,"my mom and i are really close , and i talk to her almost everyday .","she said it 's very quiet without me at home , i guess i was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around .","even though not being at home is very weird , i love college .",the freedom you have is great ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"i'm not so sure how i felt about it yet. not that it was bad or anything, but i'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. it seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. but than again, i guess the experiments that i did this for will probably deal with those issues. i really don't know why i tried to do that survey right when i got up this morning, i just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, i finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 4 times. that was a little frustrating. there is something else that's really bothering me right now also. nothing to do with school, but socially. i live in california, and hate to say it, but i am a pretty stereotypical californian kid. i mention this because i have this burning passion for the ocean. even most people who live in california don't feel as deeply about it as i do. i knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when i came to school, but i didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. well anyway, i really miss the ocean. every night i try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. when i walk to class i even feel it in my feet and legs. just on their own my legs begin to surf. the same muscle motions, i guess they call it muscle memory. i can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. that's all i live for. or lived for. texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while. no i take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, i guess texas just got in the way for a little while. that's where my problem comes up socially. i now realize that if you're not in california, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. i feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. like i said, the perfect stereotype. i guess i wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how i felt. how the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. it's a way of life, not just a social activity. it's a culture, and it's become who i am. not just surfing. i love it but that is only one small facet of why i love the ocean. i just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times i've had there. whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. the ocean can do all of that. but people don't seem to realize that. i love texas, well i don't know if i love texas. but i definitely love ut, it's just that i have to sacrifice so much more that i realized that i would have to do. i came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. that's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. it's not that i feel like i'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. but i just wish people would have the same opportunities as i did, or have. i want them to fall in love as i did. but that's impossible if you stay in texas for a lifetime. come to think of it, i really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, i think i'm going to do that today. i've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that i lost sight of the one back in sd. i'm going to make a promise to myself that i will never lose touch of what i left back home, or the people that i left. just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as i continue to grow, and add to those memories here.

" hey, well, i am really very nervous, writing down all of my thoughts and feelings on this computer and not in my own personal journal. because, atleast there i know i will be the only one reading it. but i guess i 'll start writing about what i really have on my mind. my boyfriend and best friend just took off on a long truck ride back home, which is about six and half hours away. they (jeremiah and lauren) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes i miss them like crazy! jeremiah means everything to me and i can't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away. but then again i decided to come to texas and not to tech. right? well, that is one thing that is bothering me, the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother, who is only four years older than me, is causing some major problems back at home. and on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as i left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything. i feel really helpless because i am over here in austin and i can't help my sister or my dad go through their problems. i usually stuck up for them when i was home and now i just get to hear about them over the telephone. which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story. i know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister i'm worried about. jessica, my step mom is such a pain. she is very very, immature for her age and i saw this coming the whole time. i just wish my dad did so he doesn't have to be going thru this right now. i really miss home. i even miss my dog, homie. i bet he feels like i abandoned him. i was the only one who paid attention to him, but i hope emily is taking good care of him now. i've only been in school for two weeks and it feels like it should already be november. sounds pathetic, right? i'm wondering if this was the right decision. i sure hope so. i am a firm believer that god will never give me something that i could not handle by myself. so i just have to take this with a grain of salt and leave it at that. i just wish it was as easy as that. gosh now it has been one hour and twenty minutes since jeremiah has left. i keep looking at the clock like he is fixing to get here instead of him being on his way back home. we have become closer ever since i moved. it seems weird saying that but i really mean it. we actually have conversations on the phone, we talk on the internet, and when we see each other it feels like it did when we first started going out, four years ago! it feels great. i love him and i can honestly say that i will marry him one day. heck, i'd marry him tomorrow if he asked me. he is my best friend and i can tell him anything. he is smart and funny and really good looking. better yet, he is perfect. he has never cheated on me and always makes me feel like a queen. sometimes i'm not sure if i deserve him. but i do love him and i always will. it still feels like i'm writing in my diary, although if i was i wouldn't be as consious about typos and mispelled words! i really like this assignment though, it sure beats the chemistry homework i really should be doing right now. i hate chemistry. i hate homework! but it has to be done, right? i often wonder what would happen if i just said to heck with it all and quit. my family would freak. they are so by the book. if anyone was to go out of the norm their whole world collapse. i hope i'm not like that to my kids. i want to be different. i want to make a difference not wait for someone to do it and then say hey i helped them get there. i want to be the one to do something, something special. i just figure out what. i just know that whatever it is jeremiah is there with me when i do it. you know what? its hard to type when your nose is running! but i'm almost out of time so i'll keep on typing. i can do it, i can do it! ha, ha thats kind of funny. speaking of funny isnt if funny how when your onthe internet you mispell words on purpose and here i am trying really hard not to misspell anything, even when it doesn't matter if the words are mispelled or not. that is bizarre. remember that song how bizarre i hated it but jeremiah always sang it and it drove me crazy. thats funny ",0,"[-1.198614, 0.251265, 0.445585, 0.108517, 0.20734, 0.391112, -0.464591, -0.303963, -0.081171, 0.791682, -0.172695, 0.279021, -0.487279, 0.596803, -0.3899, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.622116, 0.328158, 0.119304, 0.37836, -0.031352, 1.045187, 0.302115, -0.624052, -1.238422, -0.600379, 0.475284, 0.356378, 0.110363, -0.291464, 0.148926, 0.417155, -0.268208, 0.066172, 0.618793, -0.048793, -0.230644, -0.340295, 0.367743, 0.269266, 0.487706, 0.562049, 1.130197, -0.197606, 0.693661, 1.481621, 0.755733, 0.48984, 0.962091, -0.960953, 0.252527, 0.24457, -0.089514, 0.902157, 0.525635, 0.977236, 0.507888, -0.188392, 0.144456, 0.063274, 0.018661, -0.135287, 0.196285, -0.234689, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.200366, 0.073562, -0.073676, -0.23436, 0.238448, 0.489802, -0.17263, -0.422267, -0.651015, 0.247206, -0.202342, -0.31623, 4.94954, 4.128422, 4.739832, 5.003403, 4.425581]"

"well, i'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. i'm about to start studying for chemistry and psychology so i do have a bit of work to do tonight. in chemistry i need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. i'm almost done with the psychology chapter i've been reading all week. it's the most interesting book i've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. all of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. today i met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because i haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. my phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so i'm just now able to get on the internet, which i've sorely missed. it was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. i have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. i'm glad someone picked up my shift at the outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. i want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. oh well, i guess i'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. i just got everything in my apartment organized today. i bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. i kind of like this assignment, i'm doing work but it's over what i'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. it's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. hopefully tomorrow i'll wake up on time considering that this morning i woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so i'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. it was fun.

"i'm not totally sure what i'm supposed to be writing about. i will be glad to get this assignment out of the way, because i have so much stuff to do. my classes aren't too bad, but there's just lots of outside assignments to do. i feel like i'm always busy, especially with being in a sorority. i love the one i'm in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. we have 2 meetings every week and then other activities. i don't feel like it's possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. i have been having a lot of fun, though. my mom thinks i party too much. she doesn't really understand that i do work on school stuff, and i do know that classes are the real reason i am here in the first place. i know that i can't go out every night. i don't think i'll have too much of a problem, because i can balance everything and plan ahead if i know something big is going on over the weekend. my seminar class is kind of annoying. it's a stress-management course, and i picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and i really wanted a seminar. everything's pretty much common sense. we have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. i do stress sometimes, and i always have a lot on my mind, but i don't let it bother me. i'm very organized, and i always find a way to do everything that i need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. my room mate does stress a lot though. she's always a little edgy and panicky. she kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. she kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. she's one of those ""the glass is half empty"" kind of people. it bothers me sometimes, because i like to be positive. i'd rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. i also don't think there's a point in worrying about something unless you have to. i'd rather just wait and see what happens. i really hope the guy comes to hook up the ethernet in my room soon. i've had so many problems with my computer, and i hate having to come to the lab. it's just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. it'd be more comfortable too, and convenient. my dad bought my computer when i moved in, but it had the wrong kind of ethernet card installed. now it has the right one- as long as james comes to hook me up! i hope there are no other problems, because then i won't know what to do. i'm so illiterate when it comes to computers, and i hate that because i don't understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what's wrong. i think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. i was kind of surprised. i wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the internet and just mailed to teachers. it's definitely less of a hassle. i'm excited about this weekend. i'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in houston. i really want to see corey. he's such a great guy, and i think i really hold back from getting too close to him. i guess it's because i knew i'd be moving, and i don't want to be attached to someone that i can't always see. it'll be nice to see him though. i might get to see one of my best friends too. she goes to sfa, but she'll be home this weekend too. i think she's having tons of fun at college too. i'm definitely glad i came here. sure it's big, but it would bother me if it wasn't. i'm having fun, and there's always something going on. i love that about big cities. i can't imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. i would get so bored. i guess it would be different if you grew up there, though.

"okay so i was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. this was something that i really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and i seemed to have noticed a difference. i first tried it out on reading a book. i realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what i was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. when listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and i kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. i am listening to a dj named paul oakenfold who is a trance dj, and even as we speak i can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what i am writing. yesterday, last night, actually i was doing some reading and i started to first listen to hip hop and i kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because i know a lot of them. i ended up spending about 30 minutes and i got through about 12 or 13 pages which is incredibly slow. after that i decide to try out some trance. i actually used to always listen to trance last year when i would read or study because i always helped my expand my mind when i was either designing things, reading, or writing. so when i was reading i noticed that i was much more attentive to what i was doing and got a lot more than 13 pages read in a 30 minute time period. as of right now i am trying out this trance thing again. the funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. the tv is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the tv but to the work that we need to get done. after thinking about this right now i am at 9 min 30 sec and i have already written a lot. i believe that if i would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that i am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music? i mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together? or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body's response system that makes you feel all numb inside. could this be another type of an anesthetic, but instead of a shot, gas, or gel, could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic? who really knows. but anyway that i am sure has been looked at for a long time. i really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me. but right now i really don't know what else i wamt to talk about because i am out of time.

"it seems like everyone has gone home for labor day weekend. lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. we had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. i really don't normally like mashed potatoes but i always just get them anyway. a couple people started playing coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. the more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. this dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. at night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. they tend to yell and be extremely loud. our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. it would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. there are so many more months before the semester is over! i'm sure it will go quickly though. twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. i still have to go to wal-mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. i'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. i've been watching way too much of ""the real world"" in the past two days. they've been playing reruns nonstop since like wednesday. this week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because monday and wednesday are my busy days. i want to get out of the city next weekend. maybe i'll go visit some friends at texas state or go to the lake. i haven't been swimming in really long time. i remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than i remember swimming in my own pool. maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. the trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but i never once got stung. the lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because i'm over half way done. the game on saturday was really fun. once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. unt didn't do very well. i almost went there instead of ut just because its close to home and my sisters went there. on the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. i don't know why i bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when i have a computer sitting right in front of me. its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. i hear a lawnmower outside. i feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on labor day. my neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. i should trim my fingernails. they keep getting in the way while i'm typing. i haven't seem a movie since i came to austin. i don't even know where a movie theater is around here. better yet, i don't know what is playing right now. i haven't seen any previews either. someone must be sick because i keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. people go out way too much. i can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. i always want to wait for the weekend. i'm sure that will change shortly though. this has been a very long weekend. i think i'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.

" so today has completed a very odd and trying week. i have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and wow!!! i seem to find myself asking, have i over done myself? i am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this i got two kittens that require a lot of attention. this, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work i have to make sure i am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but i love them. my roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like i am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? i am not trying to say i don't take their words into consideration but i believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he'she learns. this is a test for me that i hope i don't fail at but all i keep telling myself is that i must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). i am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. she found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. the doctor said she should be alright but i still worry. i really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. all i can conclude is that i have been set a full plate that i now must eat. besides all the drama i just mentioned i have finnaly declared my major as child development' pre-med with a minor in psychology. this is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which i am very thankful for. i know it will be a lot of work but i love working with children, but now whether i follow all the way through with pre- med is a different story but i know eventually i will get through it and go to med-school. for right now i need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. another thing i am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that i could have gotten two tickets the the ou game and i passed up the opportunity. there goes a couple hundred dollars i coould have gotten off ebay. oh well, that's the way life goes. by the way, my boyfriend of three years, zack, took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. we had 12 courses in 5 1'2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). the cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). anyhoot i enjoyed writting and i will see you next time, bye.

"i just got back from math class, and surprisingly, i feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 2 weeks. or i should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. but anyway, i'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. i like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining'comical, unlike my economics class. i dread that class every monday, wednesday, and friday, and i would not be surprised if i fell asleep in that class today. but there is one advantage to going to economics salina, or should i say natalie. i got to stop calling her salina. i wonder if she gets offended. i hope she knows that i mean well, and besides, she's so cool. not to mention, fine as all hell. i wonder what i'm going to do tonight, i hope i see amy. woooooohh deeee! she is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl i have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. and yes, i am keeping annie in mind. annie would be a close second. i wonder how annie is doing, i miss her. i should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 2 weeks ago! that's alright, i can just come up with another excuse, like always. that could be the problem with me. i just put things off and blame it on laziness. but i don't want to go into that right now, because i would need 20 different 20 min writing sessions. that sucks that i was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because i was about to be on fire. i wonder how many words per minute i've been typing. pretty good, i'm sure. it's surprising that i haven't mentioned jared, or dom i don't give an f about those guys anymore, and i wouldn't be one bit discouraged if i never saw them again. you better believe that. i could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. anyways, i believe that it will catch up to them someday, and i'm going to let nature take it's course. i know for a fact that miles doesn't have anything going for him, i mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from subway! not to knock subway, but i would expect more out of him, or maybe not. dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. jared, i hate to admit, is smart, for now. but oh yeah, it'll catch up. all those drugs are going to bake his head, i can already see it happening. sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. usually, i would wish for their wellbeing, but i have been through far too much. right now, i seem malicious towards them, but in 2 weeks, i'm sure i just won't care. has it been 20 minutes, because it feels like about 2 hours. i'm going to check the time, i know, i know, that's cheating, but i have to! here i go. i'm back, i've got 4 minutes left. so, there's this kid i used to know from middle school, his name is iraj. he's iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. i'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. he's got pink hair for crying out loud! and i think he's the only kid that i have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. i think it suits him, and suits him well. i'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. he actually told me that i used to look more iranian in middle school, which i think is just crazy. i would say it's the other way around. basically, he's really cool, and i wish him well. i just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. it's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. alarm? oh yeah! i guess i didn't have to check half way through. i don't think i can stop typing, it's like i'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and i really like it. it's like i can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. however, feedback would be so beneficial. i'm going to force myself to stop right now.

"i just read in alfred adler's understanding human nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood. and i consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. now, i feel the only way i can attain happiness is to create something. to form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. i need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, i turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which i can empathize and understand. my hunger for reading is insatiable. everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, i want it all. i want to absorb it so that i don't miss an ounce of life. i want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that i can mold those after. and in all of this, with all the knowledge, as i absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, i feel great anxiety in that i have not made a contribution of my own. many projects that i saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. my passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. i can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. the worlds i put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness. i am always looking forward to what i will be, what i could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions. and it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge. and i think back to my early life. my parents. childhood. when everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that tv show that i've waited for all night. these were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. it makes me so tired to look forward. to never be now. my parents were demanding. good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. always left behind in someone's expectations. enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. i loved them then. cherished them. everything i did was to attain their approval. then i would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. an ovation of some sort. i need approval. i still do. my father was a loner, and now i am a hermit as well. he never shared his thoughts. compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house. i made up games to express myself. my imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books i read. the stuff everyone else hated. the big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. when people were still learning their multiplication tables. science fiction. fantasy. anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. and i wanted to escape. straight a's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. still not good enough, because no one would share it. they wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. i just wanted to be alone. with my books. my imagination. and i've never had a close friend, because i was always so afraid of betrayal. so afraid that i would be cast out, and many times i was, when i just wanted to think. now i don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. i hope for someone who can share my mind. someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.

" no heather i did not put your picture up, i don't know why! no i didnt wash it. i really like fight club, i don't know why, actually i do. why did i even say i don't know why, itsd amazing the things you get use to saying so that you will fit in. anyways, i am trying to meet people, and its cool. i use the xcuse that other people haven't been open and maybe they were not, but at the same time, i knowe i am not as openas i was last year. ireally liked my senior year, it went by pretty fast, and i got to do alot of the things that i like to do and wanted to do. i also have really wanted to see my girlfriend and, yea, im debating wether i want to stay at our status of going out exclusively, or whether or not, we should also see other people. would marrying her be all that bad, maybe, or maybe im just sexually attracted to her. i have been playing computer games alot and i have also been studying alot more. you know something that interesting, is that people are always looking forward to stuff and never enjoying the present. do we ever really enjoy the present. sex is cool in the present, and i guess you look forward to that and you also look forward to eating, so maybe we are more like animals than people think. maybe we really arent that advanced. i wonder how much different we are from animals. which brings me to evolution, evolution makes so much sense to me, doesn't it to you? do i need peoples approval on everything?!! we are very gregarious creatures, how can therebe a god, how can there not be i don't know, but i doubt it alot of the time and take things that people might set aside as miracles as simply co incedence. i wonder if im studying enouph, or is there such a thing. do i just want to mak the grade or do i actually want to learn. i think knowing, i mean really remembering all that you study would be aswome. i think the coolest characters in story are highly intellegent. like grand adimeral thrawn, the most intelegent, incredibly intellegent bad guy. he could wipe out whole civilizations and even galaxies, by simply outhinking them, by studying their psychological weaknesses and then exploiting them to take control of them, he did so by being incredibly knoledgeable on his subject matters. he knew something on every topic, and wasd therefor nearly undeafeatable, he didnt need to see the future, he could see it through their minds and the way they reacted to different sittuations. are women evil, is all they care about is guys, i mean really what is there purpose in the grand scheme of things. all they ever do is complain, there is always something wrong with them, they only care about themselves, and they backstab each other all the time. they're frekin evil. they're all about appearences, nothing is as it seems with them, i mean what the hell is wrong with them, don't they have any loyalty towards each other, all they evercare to do is kill each other over. are people only angry at the people like them, because they can see through them, they see what these similar people are doing, and hate that they exploit people the same way that they do. is that all we do, exploit other people, is there such a thing as love. or is it just made up, or is love just a selfish thing to benefit yourself. i mean i want to be unselfish and i want others to be unselfish, is that even possible. is everyone like everyone else, are there any individuals, or is it just a giant struggle to be unique and cool. why are we here, is there a purpose to this big mess, i mean what are we supposed to do, what is the purpose of having life if all you will have is eventuall death, why did life create itself, and how is it that your cells retain thoughts. i mean how do your cells keep your thoughts, i don't understand that. i mean how do they work together to keep your thoughts and memories. the brain is such an interesting thing and it is very amazing indeed, and i would like to know about everyone elses brain sooo i could, use that information, i would like to have as much knowledge as grand adimeral thrawn, but then again who would'nt isnt that interesting, how alike we really are, and that we are in deed a product of our parents enviroment.

" the past week i have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. i am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. i so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason i keep holding myself back. this frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. my presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. i'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. i really don't think that it's me. my suitemate is about to push me over the edge. she never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. for example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. on most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. she just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. she is from beverly hills. im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. typical if you ask me. i just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. on top of that, i am homesick. i miss my friends. i miss being with richie. he'll call me once and a while. usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then i won't hear from him for quite a while. i get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. that makes me so mad. my roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. it just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but i know that he cares about me. if he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. it really makes me wonder why she is the one person i confide in the most. speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom i adore as a friend. he is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. i turn around and he is always there. i never get to sleep in my own room, i am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. i find it ironic that she gets mad at me when i talk to richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when i make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. it doesn't seem all that fair to me. but then again, what is fair? is it fair that i want to be with someone that i can't have anymore? no its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. sometimes i wonder if i will ever get a break; if maybe one day i'll get lucky and things will turn out the way i wanted them to, or if maybe richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. sometimes i wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. she and i couldn't possibly be more different than we are. i can't even believe that i am her child sometimes. she acts so much like a child. if she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. she denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. i think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. i want to tell her how i feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that i need. she always used to do that in high school. if i told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. i can never win. its either give up my priviliges or keep my mouth shut. it is a lose lose situation. i just miss richie so much. that could be the root of all my unhappiness. my mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. he called me today. ironically i was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. it felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.

"why do they make us do this? do they want to figure out what thought leads to the next? like the autistic people where their thoughts lead them to the next, but only one leads to the next, perhaps a smell or feeling or emotion. i wonder what those people feel. i wonder if they are deprived of some of the things we are. i remember hearing that they can do brilliant things, compose symphonies and paint incredible things, but need help to button their shirt. wasn't that movie starring robin williams who tried to no that wasn't it. i don't remember who starred in it. maybe it was someone who looked like robin williams didn't we watch that movie in eighth grade? the one about the people who didn't react to normal stimulants? the ones who tossed the ball around from one person to the next, but didn't engage in conversations? engage that's a good word. my roommates and i were talking about funny words the other day. pami thought that ""fib"" was a good word, and there was something else i said by the elevator. it might have been. enthralled, that was it! i remember now. i love great words. if i could have an extensive vocabulary, i think perhaps i would be taken more seriously. there was a cabdriver tonight that knew a lot of big words. i asked him to write one of my papers. what was he doing driving a cab? can't he find some other occupation that suits him better. maybe he likes to meet people. perhaps he finds it interesting to encounter different personalities. why can't he get a better job? there have to be much better things to do. but what about that movie american beauty where kevin spacey quit his job and started to flip burgers that was a good movie. maybe that's what made him happy. to do jobs that don't require a truck load of thought. but then again he found out that his wife was cheating on him. that really sucks. i would never do that kind of thing to my boyfriend. that's downright mean. what kind of girl would do that? there's no way in hell anyone would ever find me doing that and speaking of stupid things, what about suicide? why do people do that, or rather why would they ever think about it. that is so selfish. if i ever found out my friends were thinking about it i'd beat them into the ground. what would make them think that there is nothing left in the world for them? do they think no one loves them or cares for them? i just don't get it. what a stupid thing to think or consider. some people have real problems. i had a conversation like this with my kickboxing instructor one time. it was after the cardio kickboxing class and i was talking with him. i don't know how we got on the subject, but he told me this story about one of the guys that used to go there a first degree black belt and he committed suicide. in fact, i knew the family. the mom actually helped me with this paper i was writing for my really tough english teacher. little did i know that not only was my english teacher tough, he was brilliant. i have such a great respect for that man. some day, when i make it big and the word is ""when"" because it will happen i'm going to send him a shit load of money for retirement. i have so many plans for when i get older. i'm going to start a scholarship in my name and all this other grand stuff that i can't think of right now. oh look at that, the time is up. catch you later.

"i don't have to follow any rules except for the ones that i create for myself. as the days have gone by i have slowly but surely felt that i am alone. not being without my family has created feelings of sadness inside. i know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. i have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. i am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. i have been forced to come to terms with the fact that i am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. i must now assume total responsibility for myself. however i know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when i am in need of more money! rrhaha! i am really feeling excited about being in austin because i am closer to my sister in san antonio and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. i love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. i consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. harlingen, the town that i am from, has the population at ut and it is a rather conservative place. if some of the people in austin were to go down to harlingen and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. i love the fact that in austin all things go. going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because i did not know what to expect. i found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. also, i don't have to go to class if i don't want to. although i could not see that as a possibility because i feel if i do that, then i will fall behind and lose valuable information. i feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since i got here. i have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. i guess it is because i feel overwhelmed about being here at school. i just need to relax and enjoy this ride. i find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. i like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. my sister and her fianc' came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. he is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. he really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the oh my gosh, i'm so scared of college and i know i'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. overall i am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that i will experience here at the university of texas at austin.

"" now i'm remembering what my friend said about the buddhist religion and one of the guidelines in it. it basically said that if you get rid of desire, you will feel no pain. kind of an interesting statement. because it shows a whole set of values that you could change, and this would make you happy. now thinking of what my evolutionary biology teach once said. purpose of life is to pass your genes onward, sense genes are immortal. these two statements seem to conflict with each other. that funny. now beginning to think about what time it is. 7:18, only 7 more minutes to go for this rant. well, guess i can explain what i plan to do tomorrow. going to cal class and spark up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex. reasoning being is for ""help"" on the homework, just needed though. i should just do it and get it over with. that approach never works for me, but never say never right. it should be very simple to do if i get there on time this time. getting a little hungry now, but i will finish this, only have 5 more minutes anyways. damn just remembered an embracing moment in deutschkurs (german class) freaking had a voice crack, och. hate speaking in front of others, don't know why. draws people to look at me i guess, and i'm not comfortable with that. has to do with a self esteem problem. am working on fixing that by making myself get use to attention. don't know if that is the right thing to do, maybe might learn something about it in this class. (one reason why i took the class, and sure for some people as well ) noticed the brackets i have been putting all over this. seems like my consciousness is explaining something to me. that a interjoke. oh times up.

"the first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. my gawd! now i am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. oh, i guess i will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. now my roommate brandon is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. maybe if i ignore him for long enough, he will go away. my glance has caught the sight of the daily texan. what a lousy newspaper. it is really short, and the best-written articles are from the associated press. that's really pitiful, because the associated press writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. but that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. i see that they (ah, the non-descript ""they"") have created a virus that destroys the aids virus in at least some instances. supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. that brings up the issue of testing on animals. i have mixed feelings about the issue. if only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. and if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. but that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. i saw a twenty-twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. they were so intelligent, and so smart. they were depressed, and so sad. poor babies. why do i call them babies? because that implies that they are poor and innocent. i hate the ""dart"" board in our dorm room. it is not a true dart board, but one of those velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick.

" today is friday and i am feeling sad because my i had been hoping to see my boyfriend justin this weekend. actually, originally i had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to la grange. but then his trip to la grange got cancelled and i was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. but it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. but next weekend i will see him because i am driving down to houston next friday. i am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. next sunday, september 15 is his brothers' birthday. he has two brothers, they are twins. their names are jack and john. they will be turning 11. this weekend i am going to buy them birthday cards. the only problem is that i'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now john wants to be called hunter for no particular reason. so i want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but i also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. by that i mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. a nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. but i want to be nice to his brother. i am very tired right now. i didn't get enough sleep last night, i stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. i had planned to take a nap after my 10:00 class, but i got sidetracked, and i had that guilty feeling that i should be studying. so i went to the library and studied a little bit. and now it is 3:00 on friday afternoon and i really have nothing to do. that has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. my roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. and i really like it here a lot, but i guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. but i have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. at first i was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. i'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of justin or home or my parents or something and i'd feel like i wanted to cry. now that things have settled into sort of a routine i feel better. and i know it just takes time. i can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation i am in - he was in a long distance relationship. but he went to a&m. also, his girlfriend was still in high school, and my boyfriend is the same age as me. but he was miserable, i remember how sad he was. he used to come home every weekend. but he was in college station, only about an hour from home. anyways, i wouldn't even want to be like that. i don't want to seem like i can't handle things and i have to run back to justin all the time. but i really miss him and i have this lost feeling, like i'm not sure what to do with myself. my roommate went downstairs to get her laundry. she had a little package slip in the mail too. justin said that i should check my mail today and i did, but i didn't get anything, so i don't know what he's talking about. it's a very cloudy day today. i am supposed to do this homework assignment for my astronomy class where i have to observe the sky and measure the angles of different stars. so i hope it clears off later. the other problem is i can't find a place from where i can do it. at first i thought i would just go to the top of the jester parking garage, so i did that last night, but it wasn't tall enough - i couldn't see the horizon behind all the tall buildings and stuff. so i'm not sure exactly what i'm going to do about it. it is actually stressing me out, because i just don't know what to do. i hope i will figure out something this weekend. the homework is not due until thursday. but i'd rather get it over with. my roommate just came back and said that i did have a letter from justin. that is weird because i checked the mail earlier and there was nothing for me. so i'm excited now. now she is folding her laundry. i did my laundry yesterday. it is so expensive, 75 cents a load. that is why i'm going to take my laundry home next weekend.

"i am very excited to be taking this psychology class since i was unable to take a psych. class in highschool. i am hoping that this class will give me some direction on my major. as of this moment i am supposed to be working towards pharmacy school, but i am beginning to think that it wouldn't keep my interest for very long. (you know it is very hard for me to just write in my train of thought, and i don't know why. i'm not much of a perfectionist or anything) anyway back to psychology, psychology really sparks my interest. in class, we discuss finding answers to many questions, but they normally pertain to other people than ourselves. most of the questions that i would like to explore pertain to understanding myself. i am generally a happy person, and although i know that i will go through tremendous changes during my college career, i feel that i have a pretty good grip on the person i am. but--even though i feel this way, sometimes i have uncontrollable and unexplainable emotions. when this happens, all i can think is ""why?"" psychology is one of those things that i don't know much about, but even with the little knowledge i have, i am amazed. i think it is very possible i may want to have a career in this area. i don't really know how i got on this spill about your class; probably because it drives me crazy not knowing what i want to do. i've always had everything very planned out, but after really thinking about it, that isn't the way i want to plan the rest of my life (if that makes any sense). what i mean is. i can't just pick a job (say pharmacist), and decide ""i'm gonna be a pharmacist. "" that is what i did about a year and a half ago. i even got a job as a pharmacy tech at walgreen's which could help me out a lot. but, now i feel like pharmacy would get very dull and boring. i feel like i'm on an endless search for something that really sparks my interest. i've never been really exceptional at one thing or in one subject, and that makes me feel kind of lost, like i don't have a calling. psychology sparks my interest more than anything else, but i haven't been through the course so i can't really say if i have a ""passion"" for it or anything. along with my search for a ""passion,"" i want success more than anything. i have had an average life i guess, but my life would never be complete with out stress. not stress in general, but financial stress. i know that i am much more fortunate than many others, so why am i so stressed. i guess because all of my best friends were spoiled rotten, and i began to forget that i was so fortunate. i wasn't able to do all the things they were able to, i didn't get to drive a nice car, go shopping , or out to ear. these are all things that i believe are superficial, but i would like to be able to do these things with no worries when i am older. even more so, i would like to spoil my kids rotten when that time comes around. anyway (i'm a little scatterbrained today), i am a little afraid that when i find my so called passion that it will be something that will not allow me to accomplish my second goal.

"i had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time i wanted to do it or remembered to do it, my boyfriend michael was in the room. i didn't feel like i could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if i knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second. i guess i knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time; stuff that i didn't want him to know about. he would kill me. not in the literal sense of course but in any case, he would be destroyed. if i told him what i was thinking it would be the end. i don't want it to be the end. i'm not saying i don't want it to (i've got mail, and i really want to check it, but i'm going to keep typing) go on forever, but i love him enormously and if i told him that while he was gone for an evening i slept in another guy's bed and we ended up fooling around. that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with michael. i've always been big on honesty, but why can't i bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between damian and i? maybe because he'd ask why and i'd say that i'm not even really sure why. that's a big problem with our conversations. if he asks me why or what's wrong (he says ""what?"" a lot) i can't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then i usually can't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if i attempt to describe it, then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he'll bring it up later because he's like an elephant. he never forgets. so i'm still trying to figure out why? maybe i needed something exciting. i've known michael for years and we've been dating for over 8 months. i was never really physically attracted to him, but only later i was because i loved him. the first time i met damian i almost stopped in my tracks. i don't know why. maybe it was because the first time i saw him was when i walked into a friend of a friend's apartment (he's my friend's friend's roommate) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop. after that night i couldn't stop thinking about him and i heard (dang it, why didn't i put an away message for my instant messenger. that friend of mine that i was just talking about imed me but i told her i had 10 minutes left so i'll talk to her later. probably about this assignment and because we've been discussing this damian issue) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too. the next time i went over there i didn't really talk to him much. but the third time i was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there. after that we started emailing each (okay taking the towel off of my head. or maybe not, my hair's not quite dry yet. i'll just unwrap it) other. then the night two weeks ago that michael went to a concert, i went to damian's apartment with my friend and we all hung out. nothing too spectacular. i didn't intend on staying over but i developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night i was so sick that i couldn't move, much less drive. the guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so i wouldn't have to drive home and the rest is history. i felt so guilty lying in bed with him though. he had asked me if he could get in bed with me and i said yes. i said yes. i didn't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back. i didn't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but i didn't pull away either. i was very still when he kissed my forehead, but i didn't tell him to stop there. why didn't i? because i wanted it. but i have a loyal, devoted, loving, honest, wonderful boyfriend already. why did i want this, or think i needed it? it was thrilling. even though damian was a bad kisser. it was like kissing a large mouth bass. eventually i gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined. it wasn't really sexual. for the most part. this is making me sound horrible. i probably am horrible. yeah, i am. this was cheating. and by not telling him and by still communicating with damian via phone now and still email, i continue to be deceptive. damian doesn't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to london at the end of the year. and i don't love him. i don't really know him. i've hardly been around him except for three or four times. we've had two meaningful conversations. the whole concept of a relationship with him is silly. yet i haven't been able to stop thinking about him since i met him and wondering about him, etc, etc. i just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me (just got out of the shower before i started this). my palms are kind of damp, not good for a laptop probably. okay, it's been more than 20 minutes so i'll stop now. i wonder why i wrote a confession of sorts. and i wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this. i'd better not save this, just in case michael finds it. i'm terrible.

"what am i thinking? that is quesiton i sometimes ask myself when i'm things that are out of this world. thinking, to put the mind to work and have conversations in your head about whatever is on your mind at that moment or to ponder over a serious of questions or question such as this one. right, now i'm thinking of what to write, and as always not being able to think of anything worth writing. its not my thing to write out of the blue without having prethought what i was going to write. i'm sitting in front of my computer, cold and tired from a very long day. my dorm room is always to cold so i have to sit here shivering while i type. the cold may be affecting my train of thought since i'm preoccupied in thinking how i'm going to keep warm after this is over. i should have put on a sweater but for some reason i let myself remain cold and keep complaining about it. it's my fault really,i should just get up and put on a sweater or wrap a blaket around me. what stops me from doing it, i don't know. it could be because i have to stay here for twenty minutes typing or because i'm to lazy to actually get up and search for something warmer, or it could be because it won't be long after i put in on that i will have to take it off to go to sleep. i never found it comfortable to sleep with a sweater on, except of course in the extreme cases like when i used to go camping out in the mountains in the middle of january. i like camping, its the one thing that i love to hate and vice versa. during the day it nice to going hiking and stuff but during the night it can be horrible having to take a bath in the freezing cold and make dinner by fire and lamplight, not to mention the cold hard ground and the paper thin tents that are suppose to protect us from the 30 degree weather. i'm don't really like the cold but then again when its a hundred degrees outside i wish winter would come. people in general are never content with the weather. its either to hot or to cold,like food almost. we blow on soup to cool it down and hold ice cream in our mouths till it melts before swallowing it. my radio is on and so is the tv which has nothing to do with anything but we are suppose to write continuously for twenty minutes, so i thought i'd write that. its relaxing to be listenting to the radio, cause even when i'm down there's alway a song to cheer me up. right now i'm relaxed happy to be ahead in my reading but aware of a test i will have to take this friday. people always have the ablity to walk in at the wrong times. someone just knocked on the door and i shouted to them to come in and in seeing me at work they left but they did disrupt me which of course is always inviting except when i have to do something where i can't be interrupted like this timed writing. in 30 seconds, never mind i'm done.

". stream of consciousness well, in other words, free association. i can accommodate this assignment. it's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied. as i was walking home from a stressful day of calculus, chemistry, and psychology, i passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building. the animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking. on normal circumstances, squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans. however, this squirrel continued to hunt for food as i walked by it. i stopped and watched it, it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object, try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent. curious i continued to watch, wondering what else it would do. i approached the squirrel, closer and closer. when i had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground, attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings. fantastic! i never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself. i had always thought they would run and jump away. i remained crouched on the sidewalk as i continued to watch this curious little squirrel. after some time it started slowly approaching me. i continued to watch it, much like a predator stalking its prey. without motion or movement i crouched and stared at it. it came to within 18 inches of me. how wonderful! the squirrel wasn't afraid to come towards a human. it remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel. of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances. i was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel. at one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street, it found a mass of dumped bread. the rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory. once there the squirrel began to eat. after eating half of the portions, he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread. not finding a place, i began to try to help. i grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel. i realized i was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building. i was trying to help my new little friend. finally, after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people. i felt anger, why would someone do that, i'm interacting with this squirrel. after it ran into the tree, it didn't come back down. at some point i left. in retrospect, i think i spent almost 40 minutes observing the squirrel. i was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions, but afterwards, amazingly, i was calm and i actually had an enjoyable time playing with it. i also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel. i never knew that they were as smart as i observed, i also realized even more what incredible running, jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have. some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste, but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening. many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world. a squirrel having so many complexities. amazing. what about the human being or the human mind. the complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible! so many questions. it's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting. wow very very crazy.

" i just opened itunes and chose to play miles davis's album called ""a tribute to jack johnson"". the first song ""right off"" begins with a strong groove. this music first puts me into a pretty good mood. it motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise. now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up. larry coryell is on guitar i believe, if not i'm pretty sure it's john mclaughlin. now miles is playing. gosh. he's quite an impressive player. he's not showing off by playing a note every second. he takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody. . and they're always good too. i'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime, to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing, because of a difference in style from the popular, well-advertised music of the 90's and 00's. or otherwise some people aren't even given the chance to be exposed to it. my roommate just came in the room. speak of the devil, eh? take him for example. when i first met him and asked what he listened to, the first two things he said were ""metallica and linkin park"". both of which i am not biased against or hold negative regard towards. actually i find both bands to be quite interesting. i was exposed to metallica and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school, and definately listened to it quite extensively. side note: it's getting hot and i'm turning on the fan. could this music and the pressure to write as fast as i can be causing my body to heat up? that could be quite interesting. going back. i find it weird, well not weird but sad basically, that people like my roommate haven't heard and don't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes. ""new"" meaning ""previously unknown"" as opposed to recently released. the song just phased into an ambient sound while miles is playing over it. the drums, bass, and guitar have dropped out. when the jam comes back in. and here it comes. oh yes. well done. movement (change) in music i have realized (as a good explanation) is what creates uniqueness and good sound. change can include any part of sound. pitch, tempo, tambre, etc. now it's just the bass and miles. on this album is billy cobham on drums, herbie hancock is on keyboards. i'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head. my roommate is playing video games behind me. i understand his addiction. i used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school. i went to an arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics. obviously i did well enough to get into ut, but sadly not well enough for my own standards, although i did not realize it at the time. i quit playing games during my senior year in high school, picked up some other bad habits, but since moving to austin for school things have changed nicely, and although i'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet, i guess i feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future. although the future is quite unexpected, otherwise i don't really know what i'm going to do. the song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it. . and time's up.

"the first sensation i feel while beginning writing is the hard carpet of the dorms at dobie on my elbows because i'm lying on the ground with my laptop, but then again, at least the floors aren't wooden like the floors at the other dorms, so i really shouldn't be complaining. also, my eyes are burning because i'm tired and want to go to sleep, i sleep a lot less in college because during the day there's constant noise and people and it's so much more fun to walk out in the hallway or go to the lobby and talk to people and see what's going on than to sit in my room and study, and since i don't study and do homework during the day i do it late at night when there are no distractions. if i stayed at jester, i'd go to the library to get work done but i'm too lazy to walk from dobie to jester. this assignment is pretty easy and a whole lot better than sitting and doing my calculus homework which i have yet to do but i just looked at the clock on my laptop and it's only been 2 minutes since i've started and 30 seconds was when i got up to get a pillow to put under my elbows. my eyes are tearing now i don't know if tearing is a word, but they're getting watery from staring at this computer screen too long. i'm supposed to continue writing for 20 minutes straight and say what's on my mind and what i feel?? what if all i can think about is how i wish i was in bed, i think it's the music i'm listening to that's putting me to sleep. it's trance music, because that's what i have downloaded on my computer from napster, i hope they don't shut down napster. the courts are right about how the people who actually made the music (my roommate just called, i got all excited that my phone rang this late at night, i'm not a nerd, it's just that, i think it's this guy i know in okok back to napster) the people who make the music don't get their share and i understand and napster really should be shut down but i don't want it to because it's so nice to just type in the name of a song and there you have it, especially when they're old songs you haven't heard for a while. i love music, all kinds of music, it's the coolest feeling when a song brings back memories, or reminds you of people and events. it's 12:30 and i have to stop at 12:42, i hope i'm doing this assignment right because it's too fun,, it's kind of like a diary, maybe this could be our final??? does the professor even read these essays that people write because i can't imagine reading 500 something essays about absolutely nothing even though those are the best kind, kind of like seinfeld a show about nothing that everybody loves. the music i'm listening to makes me think of illegal drugs, this is the kind of stuff people listen to when they're on ecstasy, it enhances the experience, i wonder why people need other things to have fun i understand it, but the world would be a better place if all the drugs were wiped off the face of the earth, but if that was going to happen, you might as well get rid of alcohol too, and nicotine and sugar and caffeine or anything that alters the mind, which is just ridiculous. everything's here for a reason, i don't understand how people first invented and figured out stuff about drugs, i understand it when they grow out of the ground but stuff like pills, how were they invented did someone just put a lot of stuff together and try it and they found a combination that worked??? i'm scared for my younger sister, she's in the 5th grade, and there's so much going on now, with drugs and all, it's everywhere you go, and when she's my age, it will probably be so much worse, and so readily available, and curiosity is such a crazy thing, and no matter your willpower no matter what people always told you, you still want to try, and all the things we learn in elementary school about what to do and what not to do i think they bring in the whole forbidden fruit issue. i remember in 8th grade thinking ""how can something be so powerful that it can make you do things you never would, and make you steal from friends, and make you feel so good that you would do anything to get it. i would try it, just once. "" i can just imagine my little sister thinking like that. and you can't even shelter anyone anymore, because it's everywhere. you can't take her out of one school and put her in another, because it'll still be there, rich school or poor, minority or strictly white. it scares me to think about our generation in 50 years, because i can just see the damaged brains and the lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. yuck i'm not even tired anymore because thinking about stuff like this gets me excited and ready to argue with someone. my twenty minutes are almost up and i could talk forever about what's on my mind, i always think about a lot of things which isn't really good because i can never fall asleep ok that's 20, time for calculus ",1,"[0.350773, -0.964315, 0.920829, -1.060846, -0.804062, -0.490692, 0.265367, 1.335344, 0.763479, 1.208213, 0.29244, 1.280798, -1.039011, -0.563173, 0.232389, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.711038, -1.300753, -0.307556, -1.455218, 1.627985, -0.586619, -0.108847, -0.25765, 0.773955, 0.008852, 0.229643, -0.729368, -0.100183, -0.381236, -0.260509, -0.93583, -0.339005, -0.632442, -0.597226, 0.494177, 1.831225, -0.073017, -0.213996, -0.263522, 0.036025, -0.063161, 0.142009, 0.322763, 0.264697, -0.052908, 0.000335, 0.233724, 0.091553, 0.540543, -0.275521, -0.71875, -0.783376, -0.398995, -0.197656, -0.102143, 1.212155, 1.244606, -0.244074, -0.159081, 0.661325, -0.480161, -0.187213, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -1.715855, 1.389131, 0.125079, -0.23436, 0.896848, -0.37208, -0.337085, 0.053087, 1.541225, 0.169646, -0.225255, 0.10337, 4.601282, 3.648829, 4.595451, 4.672723, 4.891338]"
" right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me. i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week. i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a,little more hard core than its been. i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something. this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i don't know what is so weird about it. i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy's which is good but its not what i wanted. when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw. i don't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it. you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way. now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something. i think my cd is over now. no its not. i don't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying. oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd. my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one. maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one. i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something. oh well she can live. im really tired and its only like 9:45. probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning. this song is definitely the best on this cd. i love dave matthews- i've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome. ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then. that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there. not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway. it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener. i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random. is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything? i don't think so- so oh well. my knee hurts. i think i should ice it or soemthing but i don't have an ice pack. i guess ill have to get that sometime. an ice pack and sweet tea. if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later. this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea. you can't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp be nasty. i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria? i guess it doesnt matter. i miss the italian food from up there so much. i can't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there. not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time?

"it's 5:27 and i am beginning this assignment. it's an interesting one. you never really pay attention to how your mind jumps from one thing to another, at least i don't. my roommate just came in. she thinks i am mad at her and i am a little. i'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. i hadn't eaten anything all day and i was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. i had waited for nothing. we get along very well, but i don't think she realizes what she does. she keeps interrupting me while i'm writing this and it's timed. she got mad at me just now because i asked her to be quiet. she left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. i really don't like the girls next door. we get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. the one's next door just aren't very friendly. my roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because i was playing ozzy osborne. one of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. i hope my roommate doesn't start acting like i'm mad at her or vice-versa. she's on the phone. her guy problems are pretty entertaining. i try to help her out, but i really can't empathize with her. she has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. zack is going back to graham tonight. he's one of my friends from home. i've known him since kindergarten. i've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. maybe he'll decide he likes me too. i doubt it though. that's a depressing thought. oh well. there are plenty of other guys around here. in graham there were not even close to as many. population:9,000. graduating class: 134. that's why i came here. i wanted to be in a place with many other people. i have definitely found that place. a lot of people from graham thought i was crazy for wanting to come here. i guess different people want different things. it makes sense. one of our friends from down the hall just came in. she's very cool. she's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. it's very beneficial to know people. everyone has something to offer. of course, you have to give also. some are better at that than others. i know i've given plenty of cigarettes. hopefully i've contributed more than just that. i've offered advice, which of course i always thought was good advice. i've tried to be friendly. i've given complements. i've loaned money and shared food. o. k. , i've done my part so far. i think school is going to go well. i just can't let people take advantage of me like i have in the past. i think i can manage the academic part pretty well. the only thing that is difficult so far is calculus and that was to be expected. i've been doing my best though, and that's all i can do.

"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like s&m. i came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers i have had correspondence with since i recorded my cd. the fraternity parties weren't that great except for a kappa sigma one that was pretty wild. i pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. i am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in bfe. i can't say it's all been bad though i did get a free t-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. i don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then i can continue to ramble. college is supposed to be the best years some say. i think i should of keep better stock in my highschool years. now except for parties i live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language i don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. i'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. so i'll let you off till i have to write the next one.

"i do not want to draw that apple again. it's so redundant that it completely diminishes the idea of art. i mean, i understand that professor gant wanted us to experience the ""discipline"" aspect of art, but it's really hard to express yourself with a piece of fruit. it's not even like one of those beautiful pieces of fruit you see in most paintings. it's from the jester cafeteria, so of course it looks like it's been through hell. i can't believe i paid seventy cents for it. that's relatively cheap, but it's a bruised, disgusting piece of fruit. the food there is expensive compared to the quality of it. day before yesterday, i paid almost three dollars for a bowl of wilted salad and a glass of tea. maybe i'm just being cheap, well, actually it's my parents money, so it really doesn't affect me, but still. i need to call my parents. you'd think emailing them everyday and calling them every other day or like every three or four days would be enough. but no, they insist that we talk every day so that my mom can whine about how she really wants me to come back home and go to lamar. i know she's not being serious, they really want me here, but the whining gets really old, really fast. i'm so glad i got away from that area, it's such a hellhole. everyone knows everyone else's business. i guess that's typical of a small town, but i hate it. here no one cares who you are. i guess there are good and bad sides of that, but mostly good. my roommate is so loud. she's really nice and all, but she's a little annoying. she's also extremely hypocritical. she claims to be so openminded and liberal, but then i've heard her put down people who are religious, which is really closeminded. i was offended by it, too, i mean she knows that i'm a christian and she knows that i go to church, which, by most standards is considered ""religious"". oh well, i haven't been ""preachy"" about my views, so i guess i'll just attribute her closemindedness to ignorance. i really want to go to the counting crows concert, i'll have to get the tickets soon though. adam duritz voice is so powerful. anyone who can evoke so much emotion from listeners using a song, has to be a musical genius. i mean how is it possible that i didn't cry when my parents left me here in a city of a million people, five hundred miles away from home. yet, i cry when i hear him sing about a lost love. i don't even think it's the words that get me. well, that could be part of it, but i guess it's the combination of the music and the lyrics and adam crooning them out. i mean, i could be in a perfectly good mood, and i listen to a song, and halfway through it tears are streaming down my face. and i do this to myself repeatedly. it's almost like a sickness, maybe i have ocd or something. i hardly ever become emotional at movies or other times when the typically ""sensitive"" girl would cry. maybe subconsciously i know that i need to cry at certain times, and that's what makes me listen to the music.

" okay i really do not know what to say frankly i have never done a writing assignment not knowing what the topic is or what ia m expected to write but all i know is that i have to write or type for the next twenty minutes which for me seems like it is fairly a small amount of time since i type really slow. anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class, no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice. i love psych, i actually want to be an elementary counselor, i guess i choose this because my parents split up and i guess i want to help students or young kids to understand this whole mess. it really does not matter anymore although to be frank i wish things were the way the were before, not for me but for my younger sister she has suffered a lot from the desicion my parents made, well actually my mother, but who is to blame, i guess that is all in the past and i can't change that. well enough of that i am really glad that we can just type and type just letting our little heads just take us somewhere i reall appreciate this since i am not worried about how this will be graded i think i just have a little anxiety when it comes to papers, i guess i have to get into the idea that college is totally different form high school. i think my problem is that i know that everyone is expecting a lot from me since i am the first in the family to attend a big university, both in my dads family and in my immediate family. i am afraid of letting them down sometimes i really can't take it but i just know that everyone is behnd me i guess that motivates me and at the same time that kind of puts a bunch of pressure on my shoulders. i guess it is because my brother is or should be like a junior but i frankly think that he is just being a drain in the economy, i mean i probably saw him studying once in a whole semester and that was probably just cramming for his final exams. right now i really do not know whta ha plans on doing he just simply needs to get his act together not that i always do but at least i know that i won't hurt my parents the way he does. i guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin. she would just so die she would never think that i lied to her telling her that i would be living alone. i really feel guilty do not get me wrong but what can i do if she would have opened herself a little towards me then i would have probably told her, who am i trying to kid i guess that is just my excuse i have asked my mom several times already if she would let me get married and she said no, well she said wait at least two yeras i really do not knowhy i need to wait two years, she says that has nothing to do with my boyfriend which is true they get along real good i really do not know if it is that he speaks spanish or if it is the fact that he is real nice, oh did i mention that he gets paid really good. i do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad, i hope she understands a little. i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on. when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad, and i really do not want him to find out yet, you see my dad is depressed, the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier, and he says i am like his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already. i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do not agree with the way i am living it. as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me, i hate when people say don't get married because then you won't go back to school i will prove all them wrong i will teach them, i know that you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it ",0,"[0.042415, -0.044705, -0.525124, -0.383887, 0.024517, -1.499889, -0.399168, -0.748237, -0.704293, 0.655362, 0.395966, -0.590446, -0.978373, 1.339947, -0.933187, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.678239, 0.863955, -0.223243, 0.851422, 0.554921, 1.70757, 2.830202, 0.235367, -0.366116, -1.114831, -0.518989, -0.267391, -0.469098, 0.586217, -0.058289, 0.140013, 0.756456, -0.113704, 0.091836, 0.710701, -0.155764, 0.468061, 0.896279, -0.129581, 1.233971, -0.499831, -0.214222, -0.91577, 1.424823, -0.849413, 1.891531, 1.447312, 1.473082, -0.542022, -0.608291, -0.394386, 1.605782, 0.33466, -1.332176, -0.830562, -0.446107, -1.68255, 1.446031, -0.547567, 0.087627, -0.480161, -0.418002, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -1.72418, -0.153516, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, -1.319052, -0.451544, -0.408772, -1.903546, 4.83867, 4.715759, 4.212806, 5.04772, 4.589738]"
"i've never liked writing and any other literature stuff like reading. i also feel a bit different because i've never done my homework on the webpage before. it's a new thing for me. everything in college feels different. the schedule is flexible; you can have classes from 10 to 11 and then jump to 3 to 4, not all continuously throughout the day. there's also the good thing that i don't have to go to classes i don't want to go to. this freedom of choice gives me a feeling of relaxation but also fear. i feel great that i can do whatever i want, but feel fearful that my choices might not be the best for me. this assignment gives me a feeling of nervousness. i hate writing, especially when i have a time limit on it. it's hard enough for me to come up with stuff to write about when i have plenty of time, and it gets harder when i have a time limit, whether or not that there is no right or wrong things to say. i feel like i'm saying many wrong things because a lot of this is not so much feeling but some experiences i went through in college. i can't write about my feelings for 20 minutes because it's hard to know what i'm feeling and even harder to write about it.

"i sit staring at the blue syllabus from the class in front of me. what do i write about? the sad part is that it seems like such a miniscule task. write about what i'm thinking about. so now i ponder what i normally think about? what do i normally think about, but i'm supposed to be writing about what i'm thinking about right now. i'm thinking i should turn of the television behind me, yet i'm so attracted to this rerun that i have watched so many times. although since i am writing this, i am not exactly paying attention to what is going on on the television. i can hear the faint noice in the background. why can't i concentrate? i always have this problem. i feel that my attention span has shortened as i have gotten older. i have problems watching a thirty minute television program! how can i sit here for twenty minutes on task? especially since i have a million things to do. such as a paper in my literature and the law class. but i am not able to sit for a long time and simply work on that paper. how did i ever get into college? sure my grades were somewhat decent, yet i always tend to work to the point of exhaustion, mainly because i procrastinate. when i procastinate i do all at once. since my attention span is so short, and i am not able to sit and continuously put forth a vast amount of effort my work comes out poorly. this must be why i have only decent grades. i must put forth more of an effort. life can be extremely challenging especially since i am not able to do such a miniscule task of prioritizing. but why am i complaining about my grades? college has just begun! i can turn around and begin new! but i say this every time and it never happens. sure you can change anything, but come on, am i actually gonig to do that? no! i'm just pathetic in that way. its like all the people i know who have broken promises. sure everyone says they'll do this or that,but do they? i am always upset when people break promises because i never break promises to other people except to myself! i can stop being a procastinator, but do i? i can start exercising more, but do i? the most important person in my life,me , is the one person who i put last. who cares how i look to others as long as i feel good inside. do i feel good inside? hard question. do i have an answer? i don't know. i'm constantly criticizing myself. come on sonia, you can be better at this or that. but do i make a point of actually becoming better no! i suppose all people are like this, they attempt to be someone their not. i have to just face the fact that i am who i am and if i really want to change i have the chance but i don't have to change!

" i went to church tonight. it makes me feel very calm and relaxed. it puts the world into such a different perspective. everything seems so simple. it makes me want to be a much better person. the television is on. i think it's on mtv. i'm not watching it though. that's annoying song on that commercial. i don't want to go back to school on tuesday. i have a lot of work to do including reading for this class. i can't wait till friday. i get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town. i hate commercials. i don't like eating college food. i really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat. my roommate went home for the weekend. it's weird being here alone. i have been going to sleep late this weekend. i turned off the tv. i went to the football game last night. it was fun. there was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol. it makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in. it's very quiet. i want to join clubs here. i really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center. i want to make a difference that way. i'm really hungry so i am eating burnt popcorn. i will prob. make some more after i finish this. i don't know what the point of this is. i think it's a cool assignment, but i wonder what it is going to show about the way i think. i want my boyfriend to call. i miss him a lot. i saw my friends today. i bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them. they are really cute. my boyfriend is from brasil. it just occurred to me that i'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z. i'm a horrible speller. the tower was so pretty last night. i think it is my favorite part of campus. i look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it. i love it. i like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower. they're just really cool. i think i hear one of my suite mates. she went to visit her boyfriend in san marcus. i wish my boyfriend was closer. it's hard having him so far away. i know everything will work out though because i love him so very much. wow. i can't wait till friday. it was really cool visiting him in michigan. my dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th. that is also luis and i's 5 month anniversary. wow. that's a long time. i want to marry him. that may sound weird. too soon or whatever. but it's true. i never thought i would find someone so amazing. he told me that he wants to marry me someday. i wish that i could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again. i went to this meeting on studying abroad on friday. it was pretty boring. it was interesting how many countries you can go to. i want to do that one day. that would be fun to experience another culture. i mean i've been to europe before but only for a couple of weeks. not long enough to learn about it in-depth. i have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends. it's kind of sad. especially this weekend. i'm surprised how many people left. i love the picture of my baby next to my printer. he's so adorable. he makes me feel so special. i'm thirsty. why isn't my boyfriend calling me? i love the sound of his voice. i forgot that i wanted to call my mom today. i wanted to tell her about the game and find out about bridgette. i hope she is alright. the priest at church prayed for the people in florida. i'm happy that carmen goes to church now. my friend once told me that she didn't believe in god. i hope she does now. i almost started crying in church because i was so happy. i like when my boyfriend goes to church with me. he's such a better person now that he's going out with me. it's amazing how much he's changed. he stopped drinking. not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend. he wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot. i want to talk to my friend ben. he's at lsu. wow. 20 minutes is a long time. i can't believe i'm still writing. it's getting pretty boring. i don't know what else to think about. i miss my nephews they are so cute. i don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion. that's so incredibly sad. i hope i can help put an end to abortions one day. it makes me sick just thinking about it. i really don't like analynn. goodness she is very mean and fat. i'm glad that i never have to see her.

"i feel really weird having to write something. pressure? yeah. my dormmates are so loud. i can hear the tv blaring through the door right now. they woke me up this morning (on several accounts. ) i have to get used to this (or they have to shut up! :) ) my dad called right as i started this. i would really like to talk to him, but i turned my phone off. hopefully i can get through to him after i finish with this. i'm a really fast typer, this thing will probably be really long. maybe i should slow it down some. i was really suprised that my dad called. i thought that i sent him a pretty nasty e-mail last night about paying for my books (i'm really just mad at him because he hasn't made the effort to come up and see me yet. ) but he sent me back another e-mail saying that he would give me the check for my books tomorrow. when he came up for lunch. damn! i hate it when he does that too me. just when he fits the perfect category of a bastard father and i have a legitimate reason for hating him he pulls some shit like this. also, looking back at my e-mail it wasn't nasty at all. why can't i just tell him how i feel. it's a shame that no one in the psych department is going to read this, because i'm sure that one could do some serious psycho-analysis on the way i feel about my father. i would really love to do research on girls from families where the father abandoned the family. see how they turned out in their romantic'sexual relationships, how they relate to other men. i know that i would probably be the perfect sterotypical i don't have a daddy girl. insatiable sexual appetite, emotional codependency, needing to constantly be reassured that the ones i love most won't leave me. it makes me really sad what my dad has done to me. i don't think it's ever really angered me (i don't know that i've actually ever been really angry at anything), but it makes me almost stiff with sadness. my roomate just walked in totally throwing my stream of consciousness off, but i think i was probably done with that thought anyway. i don't know what i'm going to do with my college education. there's just so much that i could see myself being really happy doing. i would love to go into print journalism (write for a newspaper or a magazine), psychology (what i talked about earlier), teaching (i don't know why. i just love kids and i feel that i'm a really good teacher), then there's politics. i could really see myself getting into a campaign. but last night i had a dream, so real that earlier today i couldn't remember whether it had really been a dream that i just had to get into the college of communications. i wonder if that holds any weight to what i really want to do. how logical does it sound to make a career descision on a dream? some might say that it's very logical, like mom. i love her so much. i remember when i was a freshman in high school and brainwashed by fbba, and we would get into these huge religious debates. now i think that there may be more truth to what she thinks than what i believed. i miss her and austin so much that it hurts. i'm cryng now just thinking about it. after the divorce, we became a unit. now i can't help but feel that that unit is slowing crumbling. i miss how austin would always make me laugh. he's so goofy. i remember when football was on he would pile up thed cushions from the sofa and dive into them. i feel like a little piece of me has died, even though he's only 2 1'2 hours away. who is this close to their brother? but, mom was never home and for the past 2 years i've kind of raised him. i remember when he and i would commisserate about how much he and i hated roisin. i feel realy bad for not being able to get ahold of her before i left. i guess i probably could have tried harder. that's my problem. i get so close to being a good person, or being a sociable person as is the case at school, but i never follow through with what i say i will. i wonder if that has anything to do with dad never doing the same thing? i am so excited about american idol coming on tonight. less than 2 hours. i really hope that kelly winds. i miss kenny and bevin. i'm not really sure that she wants me as her bridesmaid, or if she's just doing it because kenny asked richard to be his groomsman. when i call them she never seems to want to talk to me. oh well, she asked me and there's nothing that she can do about it now. well, i guess there is. i want to get married. to richard. and i want to raise a family. i want a dog. i want to be happy. i want to watch our 4 kids grow up and have kids of their own. i would really love to be in huntsville with him right now. i wish that i could life the ut campus and set it back down in huntsville. i mean, i love ut but i hate having to be so far from richard. it was really fun this weekend staying with him. i do feel really bad about giving that guy my number. he called last night and he talks as if he was really slow. oh well. i know i won't follow up on it. and why would i? i'm in a very serious, very committed relationship. and i love richard very very much. i really believe that he is my soulmate ",1,"[-0.406709, 0.733631, 0.427356, 0.485191, 0.604835, -1.064513, -0.214028, -0.457487, -0.045181, 1.424052, -0.183988, 0.273783, -0.768524, 0.198944, -0.304759, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.014508, 0.65884, -0.334096, 0.605158, -0.742368, 1.412688, -0.530488, -0.277578, -0.431499, -0.27808, -0.379607, 0.810773, 0.510257, 1.619327, -0.54551, 0.643287, -0.369845, 1.169338, 0.343415, 0.619212, 0.145959, -0.013424, 0.882575, -0.305685, 0.207184, 0.143443, 1.096365, 0.020333, 1.191826, 0.874478, 0.843285, 0.953453, 0.610737, 0.113359, -0.435318, 0.46414, -0.549613, 0.077193, -0.152332, 0.483076, 0.68461, -0.590876, 0.593332, -1.097939, -1.016918, -0.190243, 2.156817, 0.240378, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.119707, -0.202106, 0.020296, -0.23436, 0.281447, -0.130566, 0.215909, -0.422267, 0.161305, 3.660279, 1.326583, 0.325031, 4.844567, 3.900863, 4.54084, 4.827304, 4.917384]"
"she kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does, it kind of put things into perspective for me because i wouldn't know what i would do in her situation. well now that i am back in austin i try to work hard and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that i necessarily want to because that would be bad. well now the people i am with right now are bothered because i am using their computer and i don't want them to see what i am typing, i usually feel this way with anything i do, i don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that i write, do, or accomplish the time isn't really going by to fast right now . i have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. i am a strange strange person. everyone always tells me that because i always hold back my thought and when i want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that i work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. i don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and i feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. but they tell me not to worry about so i tell them not to worry about me, i also tell them that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that i will be able to take care of it in the long run. right now i'm just tired of being a burden i know what i have to do and i am going to do it. i have done this type of assignment before, i once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when i said that i was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when i told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes.

"i don't know where to start. my mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. ut is great but i am not sure where i fit into things right now. it is really just one big cycle for the time being. when i was driving here from arlington, my dad told me that i would not hang out with any of the people i already knew because you will ""drift apart. "" but i like my friends. i have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. i also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. the three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. for me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. constantly. i want to fit in somewhere, but i am not sure i want to pay for it. it really is strange. all this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. speaking of study, i have nothing to do but read. no busy work. just reading. that kind of reading will fry your brain. this has been a weird week. everything has changed. school, friends, family (or lack of). it is kind of cool, though. i am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. it is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. i simply want it to be easy. i guess that is what college is for. it teaches you to grow up. now i have laundry to do. just another fun thing to do. it really sounds negative, but my life is good, i guess. just finished that 32 page questionnaire. while most of it was simple, it really does make you think. especially when it asks, ""are you certain about your answers?"" who knows? do you like yourself? of course. are you sure? yep. i guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. that never crosses my mind. it is too much fun to live. challenging experiences though. sure wish ut would have won yesterday. it was great yesterday. went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. that just kind of ruins the whole effect. back to the frat thing. we were supposed to go to party for the sigma chi's after the game. i really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. most of the guys are cool. but i think i am going to wait. they all say it is best to join 1st semester, but that is what ""they"" say. i believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. i guess. i think i just need to meet more girls. that would make life much more enjoyable. that has got to be the answer. i have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. but at that point, i never knew the difference. now it is hard. i think it is because of insecurity. i am really not afraid to admit it. i am insecure in meeting girls, but i will have to grow out of it. for now, i just wish i didnt have to read so much. it isn't that bad, just boring. you cannot retain 40 pages of economics in one day. it is just not possible. but i guess i will try my best.

"so this is the first entry, and it happens to fall on a day when things are really. shitty. i don't know if i have the desire to join the rowing team, though i've already told everyone that i was going to; my internet connection was messing with my earlier, a reason to cry in itself; my relationship with a boy i don't know enough about. lets start with that. i've been dating him for about a year and a half, and i don't know who he is. will he cheat on me? is my relationship anything to be worried about? if a stranger looked into our lives, would he giggle, surprised at the immaturity of our relationship? is it anything to try to save? i hope so, if not i'm a fool. but i think i'm one anyway. but paul henry, he knows his shit, it seems. or its that he knows that he doesn't know his shit. i wish i knew. i wish i knew him as well. though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me. i have nothing against christians or their beliefs. i wish i could give myself up to that with no regrets. but i can't. i've been down that road, and its lead nowhere. have i spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian? will i ever be content in my own two damn shoes? will i ever feel like i'm at home? will i be successful? would i be happy without success? it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect, even the less desireable, that there's some author out there, other than someones god, writing the stories of our lives. but he forgot me? why am i not going anywhere, why can't i find this happiness and joy. my life is pathetic at this point. maybe its just this horrible attitude, but the only time i feel like i can be happy (or at least not pissed off) is with brian, laying in his bed, thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time. but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements?? it would seem that i am happy with him, but then comes the doubt and fears. i need to find myself, i say. only thing is. i don't know what that means. does anyone? its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds. a state you need to obtain, but its in fact unattainable. the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they don't know how to go about it, and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them, so they can suffer justly. i wish i were born in the old days, when you died of a flu and there wasn't such a thing as aids. people lived lightly, they wrote, they read, sometimes found something to revolutionize, but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life. where did that virtue go? how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time, and where would it have gone? i wish i could sift through the ashes of our charred world, seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere, but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it. how come i can't be a writer? how come i can't write? i want to study people, not medicine. why would i declare this major? if i studied other peoples lives all the time, would i have a life of my own? is true adulthood worth it? people always want what they can't get. i get what i don't want. everything always seems like it gets really good, i mean reaaaally good, right when its about to end. will college be like this? will life itself be like this? will i stop asking so many damn questions?? will he call? would i want him to? i don't want this life. anyone want to trade? i want a life of the storybooks, of unquestionable love, faith and virtue. knowledge, hope, and an impeccable body would be nice too. i want all the money in the world, i want to live in a time without money. i want to be a movie critic, i hate bad actresses with hair that doesn't fit their character. i hate living with someone other than who i love. i hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about. i hate being inadequate, i hate second guessing everyone. i hate being critical. i hate chocolate chips. i hate gaining weight. i hate stretchy jeans that don't look good. i hate running out of time, i hate trying to fill time. i hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself, although i'm not sure why it would. seven six five four three two one.

"so i'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. i feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but i wanted to get it over with. it think it's funny that you, prof. penn, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. it must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my psy301. my mom is always reminding me that i didn't take it in high school and that's what i get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. it shouldn't be a horrible class though. i can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. i love writing. i've been writing a summer journal for the past 10 years and i love it. i'd love to write for a living but i just do the journal thing well. i could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything i want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than i thought. it's only been 3 minutes and 59, 4 minutes, 4 minutes and 5 sec. ok i can't do that forever. what would happen if someone imed me right now? would i fail the assignment because i stopped writing? i should have turned it off. yuck. i just burped. ew, i just wrote that i just burped. see, i had spaghetti for lunch and i can still taste it because the food sucks. i miss home all ready. i feel like a dork because i miss home, and i want to go home every weekend. i need to be social. i need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 6 minutes and 11 sec, 24, 16. ok i'll stop for real now. i am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't i? i guess no one will know. why do i even care? i keep switching in and out of i and i. capitals that is. i never do capitals when i'm typing on aim so why should i do it now. i don't think it capital letters. ! well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. i hope this works because i don't have a printer that will verify that i actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, i live in san jac and i had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. i wouldn't talk to her even if i wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird! i guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. i've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez i'm a dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified i'd be. i just try to blend in everywhere. i know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, i would die of embarrassment. i'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, i miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from gr came down to hang out with him, and i got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. i'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and i don't. i guess i'm jealous? i don't think so. i don't know. i wish he would just not nap right now when i could be talking to him. i can be mad about that right? he could talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh i'm kinda thirsty, can i stop to get a drink. i guess i can wait 10 minutes. hey this is my favorite frank sinatra song. luck be a lady. man i want to do a dance to this. i want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things i want to do at my wedding, but i wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me i'll be cut off when i get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. i wish money mattered a little to him. not a lot but a little. i like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it? oh geez, well, why does it matter? you probably won't even read it. why would you read my paper out of the 2300 people that you have in your classes? 5 more minutes. i'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but i got enough sleep. maybe i got too much sleep. i hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. i don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh! my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 4 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. i want to go out tonight. i don't want to see major again and i don't really want to hang out with da, but i feel like i need to go out and do stuff. i'm really sick of eating by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me? lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, i'm a giant dork. wow. how mortified i would be if you knew who i was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. i'd probably cry and run out. i've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. i really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. i had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and i had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. i hope you never read this, and i hope i get credit for it. all i ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. i would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 55, 56, self destruct, ?

"so i'm not sure on what i'm supposed to be typing about. what i smell, taste, feel like??? well i'm chewing gum. i've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. i hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. my gum got hard a long time ago. but somehow the flavor is still intact. it's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. however, i've noticed that wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. there are many pictures on my wall. i stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. there are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. i don't have one of my family up there. i kind of feel bad in a way. but i don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. i have a picture of them in my drawer if i ever need to see them. but i think it's better with them in my drawer. every time i look up at these pictures of all my friends, i miss them like no other. man, i had so much fun last year, in high school in general. but last year was definitely the best year. man, me, caroline, and shaheen in government and spanish. those were some good times. i kind of even miss my teachers. and our elephants and doing scn all the time. we have so many inside jokes. and although i'm sure i'll see caroline again, i'm afraid that when i meet her things won't be the same. and for some reason i'm scared of that. i hope i can go to lsu in the spring. or actually, i hope caroline can come to houston for thanksgiving. or both would be the best. and we can't forget about going to europe next summer. i'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with xerx and zahra. but now with this whole separation thing, i know that our traveling days with the tegra family are over. those were some fun trips too. i feel so blessed to have a friend like xerx. and even zubin and stuff. people that i've known my whole life. that even know i don't see them too often, when i do, you can tell that there's something there. like i feel so close to them cause i practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. it's a really nice feeling. i'm also blessed for shenz and the whole family. god, shenz and fred really do care about me and tash like we were their own kids. and just knowing that really means a lot to me. and i hope that mom feels the same way about zareen cause that would only be fair. so we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and i'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. but i love the professor; we call him dr. eo. hahaha, he's really cool. like i walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" wow, i was like thinking ""what is this?"" oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. the office kind of reminds me of the the vinci code. i don't know why, maybe the whole ""louvre"" idea. i always say i hate france and stuff but i really don't. i just think it's kind of funny to say that. but i really don't know why it's funny. but i mean i've said it so many times now that i really think i've instilled the idea into my head. like i really don't want to travel to france in the summer. but i mean if caroline wants to, then i really don't care. i think i'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. like about my grades- i mean if i don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? i mean, i'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. but i mean if for whatever reason i don't, then i think i'll be ok. i mean, it's not like i'm going to die or anything. plus, if i have my own family then i don't think i'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. man, it's a complicated issue. we got a phone in our room, the same one i had in my room at home. but i haven't used it once here. if anything, jennifer has used it way more than me. man, i haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause i don't want them calling in case they call when i'm not here and then have to talk to jennifer. i'm not sure what i'm more afraid of, them talking to jennifer or jennifer talking to them. no, but jennifer's really cool. but so is joanna's roommate. man, i wish i had a roommate like her. dude, me and jennifer need to start hanging out more often. but i never want us to have the same friends. john is one of jennifer's friends. majoring in japanese and stuff. wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. i've always wanted to take some random language like japanese. i don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. like me learning a african language and spe ",0,"[-0.07024, -0.040438, 0.708898, -0.003428, 1.021471, -0.115089, -0.982533, -1.000433, -0.956185, 1.276373, -0.184207, 0.126864, -1.397639, -1.525872, -1.005701, 0.0, -0.04277, 0.260302, 0.073789, 0.961781, 0.336853, 0.344063, 0.06215, -0.479859, -0.264187, -0.542127, -0.364564, -0.275167, -0.266441, 0.536115, -0.394063, 0.868116, -0.955144, -0.070667, -0.639319, -0.606362, -0.421424, -0.453611, 0.083235, 0.591461, -1.038726, -0.437556, 0.392635, 0.322759, -0.353886, 0.409966, 0.132932, 0.483866, 0.341035, 0.381894, 0.169805, -0.187173, -0.46843, -1.118388, -0.706271, -0.670537, 0.042303, -0.954251, 0.784907, 0.182981, 0.100664, -0.792456, 0.42321, -0.471184, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.286063, 0.567268, -0.073676, 0.322479, 0.500548, -0.37208, -0.049901, 0.978354, 2.079839, -0.451544, -0.408772, 1.174987, 5.108716, 3.519311, 5.06992, 5.048177, 4.67713]"
"wow! time goes by fast. here i am doing my college homework and it seems as though just the other day i was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in college. time flies and friends come and go. i have met so many people since i have been at this enormous school. i have come to realize that you must take initiative in order to succeed. for instance, i am currently majoring in theatre, but i don't know if that's what i really want to do with my life. if i don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far i can go, i will never figure out if theatre is the way i want to go or not. then there's the question of what i'd do if i didn't major in theatre. i know that i wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time i've had to write this since i have had many computer troubles. i accidently erased the first one and my friend's computer froze when i was writing the other one. i am using my friend robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. right now i'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ut, and they're talking about ross's hair. some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he doesn't want his hair cut. they think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs to differ. anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. i just remembered that i have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my room. i hope it's not stale. maybe i can drink it with my over-do milk. it's past the drinking date. this gum is very stale and i am getting hungry. if i were in my room, i would eat my muffin or the chips that i didn't eat last week because i had to get to class. you see, i feed the birds my second sandwich because i'm full. then i still have chips left over. oh, well. the joys of wednesday sack lunches from towers. i'm used to sack lunches because i've eaten a sack lunch every day in high school. the reason is that we eat in the greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. some of my friends have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers get mad. ah, the good old days. robert and ross and kristi want to order a pizza. that sounds like a good idea. it's late and i have to get up early for my intro to media class tomorrow. college is a time when it seems hard to get any sleep. there's always something you've got to do, or just good old fashioned procrastination. i mean, i don't procrastinate. this isn't even due for another week or so, and here i am, already typing it for the 3rd time. adam sandler is on tv right now. i just learned that his cds have a parental advisory due to explicit content. isn't that interesting. funny how society tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these days. like my friends. they're crazy. children are exposed to so much, like from tv. i never had cable growing up, so i don't know what it's like. we did have channel 13, kera. that was nice. now, we're listening to the doors, which reminds of a midsummer night's dream because my high school did it in the 60's and that was the music we used. well, at least, we used some doors music. we used great 60s music. then i was in a midsummer night's dream in the 90s, and we used original music written by one of the cast members. he wrote the tune for the wiz, and tranfered the words because of course shakespeare didn't write like the music in the wiz. robert just called a guy because his number was on a dollar bill. he's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. then there's ross with his mushroom haircut and kelly, who some say looks like tom cruise, but in reality, he looks nothing like tom cruise. no more than the pizza guy, who looks like a clown. i am afraid of clowns and i haven't even seen ""it. "" however, i did see a stephen king movie on new years a couple years ago with 2 girls from scotland. new's years day was 32 hours for me because i was traveling back from israel. that was a great trip. well, it's been 20 minutes and i feel like there's not much else needed to say.

" i really like doing this assignment. i did it in my senior ap english class many times. i think the assignment was really interesting to my teacher, and that is why we did it so often. i am having a little trouble with this one though because there isn't rally a topic. my english teacher would usually give us a vague topic, just something to get us started. some of the topics were going to college or music or sports or something like that. my favorite topic was always music. i think music may be the most important thing to me other than loved ones. i listen to it a lot and it makes me very happy. it is very important to me. but i think what makes me the most happy is playing the guitar. i love creating music. i think it is very gratifying. i may not always play real well, but i am always making some sort of music, even if it sounds terrible. the guitar is probably a kind of escape for me. i really forget about everything else when i am playing. it makes me feel so good. but i think i can do some of m best thinking when i have the guitar in my hand. i f i am just sitting there strumming the guitar it kind of clears my head. so i guess the guitar serves many different purposes for me. lets see. i am trying my hardest not to write about college. it is very hard since it has pretty much consumed my life for the last two or three months. it is mostly because ever since i started getting ready to move there has been so much stuff to do. i am really being distracted by the television that is on in my room. i have terrible study habits that i need to break as soon as possible before i get to far into college. i was able to breeze through high school without studying, but i know i won't be able to do that in college. of course sport center is on so it is very hard for my to resist. i know that i watch too much sports. i will really watch anything.

"i have a lot of work i need to get done with today, and for some reason i'm kind of i the mood to do my homework. you don't know me so you don't know how uncommon this kind of mood is for me. it's like when i finally decided to clean up my room, and it was just so satisfying to get the job done. i already went home for a weekend, and i went straight to my room just to look at how clean it is. it's a very satisfying feeling to know that it's that clean because of me. i kind of miss my family, my friends, my life before i got here. and i just can't stop thinking about this. today i was walking with my boyfriend, and this guy that i thought was really cute saw me walking with him. it's not like i was planning on dumping my boyfriend for this random guy, but i wouldn't have minded if he hadn't necessarily known that i was attached. maybe i could've had some fun. but really i truly love my boyfriend, but things are going well, but they could always end up changing. my goal is just that i don't want to miss out on anything in college. i want to date around while i've go the chance. if some guys want to date me, that is. tonight i'm going to this thing, i can't remember the name of it though: it's like the christian organization for the whole campus. i'm not really sure how into it i'll be. i go to church and teach sunday school, or at least i used to. i haven't gone to church in austin yet, but i'm sure it's just a matter of time. but i don't know if this christian thing is my kind of thing. i'm not one of those people that likes to go around trying to get people to take god into their lives. that's their choice as far as i'm concerned. i mainly decided to go to this meeting to meet some new people, and so i could do something since jon's going to be so busy today with his computer science homework. i can't complain too much though because if it wasn't for jon i wouldn't have computer up and working. i was getting kind of frantic about this assignment. i just wanted to get it done, but i just didn't have everything together. right now i'm becoming all impressed with my typing skills. i have to look at the keyboard the entire time, but i can press the keys pretty fast. i'm quite pleased. on saturday i'm going out to one of my family's lake houses. it's on lake austin, and they are about to sell it which makes me pretty sad. i love that place mainly cause it is so unique to have a place like that to go to. it's sad because i didn't realize how lucky i was to have that so i didn't always go when i had the chance and it's so nice and peaceful. there's another lake house on lake travis and i really o prefer that one, but i'd rather them not sell either one. people are like protesting the sell of this property because we're selling it to developers, and that makes all of the neighbors angry. i can understand that, but i have no part in the decision making. but at least for part of this weekend i won't be stuck eating crappy jester food. i think i'm almost to tw4enty minutes, and i kind of feel bad because i don't feel like i just wrote what came to mind. it seems planned for some reason, ut i never paused this whole time, i just kept typing and would always seem to come up with something to say, well i guess it's good-bye until my next assignment, but now i'm wondering if my assignment is as long as everyone else's. maybe i type slower than them and maybe it hasn't quite been twenty minutes. i can't exactly remember when i actually started this, but i kind of do need to go because i have plenty of calculus homework to do. it's not like you're even going to read this, but i'm still kind of nervous. oh well, i'm going to say i'm done now.

"a writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as i sit here i can remember all the papers that i have written. i usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what i have written before i continue. i can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. right now i'm thinking about where i need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. i wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. i looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. today is in fact my second day of school at the university of texas. i was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. now, i'm more worried that i won't be able to succeed like i did in high school. maybe i'm not so worried that i won't do well; i'm worried that it will be very hard and that i won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. well, i'm not a chemistry major, but i am a biochemistry major, so now i'm worried that i'm in the wrong class. i've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure i'm eligible for the class, and it appears that i am. maybe i just shouldn't worry. i also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. i'm basically a good student, and i usually don't disrupt the class. sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. i guess its not really a big deal, but i don't like getting in trouble. i'm one of those people who likes to do things i'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once i suspect that someone might find out, i'll try to get everyone else to stop. i know it is kind of hypocritical, but i just don't like to get in trouble. the words i dreaded most growing up were ""lisa, we need to talk. "" whenever my mother said that to me, i just knew i had to be in trouble. i would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what i did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. usually, it turned out to be nothing. i guess sometimes i worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. about a month before going to college, i spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. i guess i wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but i was crying about everything. it even made me upset that i didn't have my computer yet, and i wasn't leaving for college for another month. i just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how i wanted it to. plus i had a lot of things to do in august, and i didn't want to run out of time. it did work out, but i still became upset about it. i moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. for the past couple of years, i've told everyone that i want to be a doctor. now i'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. i can't even begin to imagine the debt that i will incur by trying to become a doctor. that made me want to look into other careers, but i don't like a lot of other things. maybe i can wait until i graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. i like to worry about everything. what i really like to do though, is to make lists. i love buying planners because i always write down my assignments. and i write what i have to do on thursday and if i don't finish that day, i write it again on friday to make sure i do it. i'm not that concerned if i don't complete my tasks, but i just want to make a list. my roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. i have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and i want to have music playing. it wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. i understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. i guess i'm just used to studying if i need to in order to do well. i just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time.

"well, here i am on friday, september something. ever since i started college i've had a hard time keeping up with the date. not really a smart thing to do since i have to stay on top of things here. i need to start keeping a daily planner. i say that everyday but then i forget to do it and it's just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do. i'm pretty hungry right now. no, i take that back, i'm not that hungry. i could eat but it's not to the point where i feel like i have to eat. my friend and i are going to lunch today. i'm so glad that i've made a friend that i can hang out with and talk to all the time. it's not the same like my friends at home though. i miss melissa and amber. i really don't know why it is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking. we talk about nsync a lot more now too. typical, we find comfort in them in our time of need. i wonder if the nsync guys would think that we're crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who justin belongs to and who jc belongs to. they crack me up. heck, i crack myself up. we talk on the phone and i have melissa and amber rolling on the floor with laughter. it's so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually i'm the one doing the laughter. a lot of times i just laugh to be polite. i fake it pretty well, if i do say so myself. i wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs? well, if this is just my one continuous thought then i guess not. okay, i love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes, could somebody please turn up the air conditioning. i think the university is trying to freeze us into studying. i hope they know that they're just freezing me into complaining all the time. and another thing, is it impossible for people to not slam their doors? really, it doesn't take that much effort to quietly close the door. i should randomly slam my door. i think every hour on the hour, i'm going to slam my door. no, that's not frequent enough. i'll slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point. really though, dorm life is not bad at all. my dorm room is so cute and i really like my roommate. no waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting. i still don't like to call this place home. home is where mom and wayne are. this is where i reside. it would take a lot for me to consider this place home. i need to do my biology homework. i wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are? the funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives. i can't even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap i'm going to do with the rest of my life. i'm pretty sure that life as a professional bum is out of the question. don't think mom would be proud of me then. okay, looks like my time is running out and i should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence. okay, how do i end this. i really don't know. this was actually kind of fun. just another way for me to analyze my random, boring, and crazy thoughts. red hot chili peppers on vh1 now. got to go. and we're out in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. bye!

"this will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something i'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. i'm listening ti the lord of the rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!! brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. half the time i walk around bundled in every layer of clothes i can find-- i feel liek an eskimo!! of course i wouldn't be in my room so much if things at ut were going a little better. sorry, usually i'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. i feel like i don't know anyone, which i don't, and sometimes i 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. a feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. i'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. however, once i get to know them, i 'll open right up. yep, i'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. my parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. i thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. my sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which i am definitely looking foward to. so, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, i do my homework. i must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at ut. spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). philosophy, poesis and psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. i knew i loved english, suspected i'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of psychology, but i had no idea i'd find philosophy even slightly interesting. right now, i'm reading about the hindu religion. i love the idea that i'm getting education!! psychology and philosophy fit so well together, too. usually i study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. while philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. it's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in psychology will back up a wispy thought in philosophy. now i'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. i read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. there was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. at first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. however, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. she gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. i clicked it away feeling very depressed. she was actually in love with the actor. however, i realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. reading this, i'd say my passion was homework. that's almost just as distrubing.

"looking at this assignment i'm trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that i want a good grade. like every other student, i don't like doing homework but i writing so it is okay. i have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend. i know i should have done this earlier but i am a procrastinator and i often wait until the last minute. i am slowly changing that habit because i know i can't procrastinate if i want to do good in school. my feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because i don't know what i am suppose to be feeling. i am just writing what comes to my mind. honestly i don't even understand the topic. all i know is that i'm suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind. i know this has nothing to do with school but i keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston. i was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldn't let her come up to austin. it is okay because i know i'll see her next weekend. i was going to write this earlier like on friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so i didn't find time to write this assignment. so far i like the class because it is the only one that interests me. all my other classes are boring. the is the only class that i enjoy the lectures in. i'm not saying this just to make the professor happy. i'm saying this because i mean it. i am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now. oh yeah, i think the experiments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade. i thought about writing the research papper because i think that might be easier but i think the experiments would be funner. i have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice. i also met some of my friends that i already knew who came here from houston just like me. i have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it i am. i don't know how long i have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind. i thought i would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that i am not. i just keep writing until i don't know what else to write. well things are starting to stop coming into my mind. all i am thinking about is how i can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop. will i think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting, anxious, lost, suprise, and not understanding. this has been a interesting paper because i have no idea what i have been writing. well i guess ill push the submit button now.

"college is so cool. i really can't remember the last time i felt so many emotions at the same time. i've already met so many incredible and different people i can't even begin to describe all of them. i am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people i have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. my boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. i hate jealous people i wish everyone would just, i don't know go along with it. i ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that i have already met from camptexas. that was like almost the most fun i've had in a really long time i'm so glad i decided to go and wasn't to scared. i was so scared about coming to ut because it is so big and i just didn't know if i could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. i'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. high school was such an almost horrible experience, i hope college is so much better. so i'm in this room with these two guys, one who i met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but i have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. he is just the hottest guy i have ever seen. so i met this really cool guy from tarytown in new york which is like the place i've been obssessed with since forever. he is a guy i would really like to hang out with. this other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with britany spears i really can't stand her but i think it is just because i am so jealous that he likes her more than me. and drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and i was just thinking about jealous people. the music is blasting in my ear i don't know who it is. drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. i really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates i need a really good girl friend to hang out with. or maybe i'm just ment to have guy friends. i guess it would be okay with me i get along with them better. i think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. which is really a relief because i though it would be really hard. i've seen so many interesting people. i miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. i would never trade this experience for going to utep that would really suck. i really miss my friend bianca and anne. i think for labor day we are going to san antonio if anne and lianna and vero come up. i was thinking about noodles the other day i wonder how she is. this is got to be one of the funnest assigments i have ever done. i really think i might double major whith something in psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks i guess i could really write forever i need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for biology and probably go to sleep i'm really tired.

"my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from vivian. i don't want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and i have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while i was writing this i was thinking several different thoughts. i think it's not good that i don't respect vivian's wishes. i really admire her because she's so old. i am not as nice as i used to be. it's funny to think about writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. i still don't talk that much though because i don't like saying something about nothing. but i guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. james and i have been getting along really well. ever since i fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and i must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what i just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset i was, and i realized how much he cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because i don't always know what i want. then he makes it apparent that he's what i want. i miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when i have a really good person already? he makes me laugh and we love, which is most important in the person i share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and i will take it. james just has more than the average joe. oooo - i've already spent 15 minutes. i should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but i acknowledge my thoughts, and i can go back and read it in the future to see my development. i want to be a model or an actor. i want the spotlight. sometimes. i want to be a better gymnast. i don't want to be judgmental. i want a copy of this.

" i'm not sure about how to do this assignment. . if i'm doing this right or not. i guess i'm a little bit nervous about this. i hope that this isn't for a grade, but i guess it is because it's an assignment. well, if it's for a grade, i guess that i can't really have a wrong answer because it's what i'm thinking, and this is what i'm thinking. i really like rockwell church. charade is a really good song. i don't know if he's going to take off for um what's it called. grammar and whatnot. i hope not. i don't really know what to write. i hope my clicking of the keys isn't bothering ali. wow. the song ended, and it's very quiet now. good thing another one just started. ooh natalie cole is awesome. i'm glad that there's the random functin on my mp3 player. i really love her voice. i wonder when drew's going to call me. he said he would call me back a little later--after frisbee golf,and that was almost a couple of hours ago. wow. it's only been 4 minutes. twenty minutes is a long time to write. i hope it goes by fast. but then again, it's time,which is constant, so i hope that i can just write for 20 minutes. that's about 4 or 5 songs. i can do that. what if i have to go to the bathroom in the middle of this or i someone calls on the phone for me. what if drew calls for me in the middle of this. i hope he doesn't get mad if i don't answer the phone. this is probably one of my better assignments. it's very interesting. i wonder what ali meant when she said, oh, wow when i told her about this. hmm. frappucino. i think i'm a good speller. i wonder if that's just easy for me to spell or if i spelled it wrong. anyway- ali didn't know. i hope that doesn't change my stream of conciousness or something like that. people asking questions that is. i wonder if the genius writers wrote in stream of conciousness. i wonder if i could be a genius writer. probably not. hmmm don't know what to write. i don't really know this song. i'm glad my bed is near my chair so i can lean back in my chair and stick my legs on the bed. that's comfortable. i really like to sit cross-legged. wow. that's aweird thing to write. . but i bet that this isn't hte weirdest thing on the scale of weird stream of conciousness writings. i think i really like this assignment. good one, pennebaker! i wonder if people call him pennebaker. good ol pennebaker. unkie pennebaker. haha. what a great name. wow. sounds like i'm brown-nosing. ehh. . oh well. . people can think what they want. i like the name. lalalalalala. . reminds me of mrs. blount. wow. she was a good teacher. i liked her a lot. she gave me good grades too. i'm so. so. i don't know. i think i maybe want to eat that tin roof ice cream in the freezer, but i'm not sure about that. wow. my keyboard is really loud. i hope it's not bugging ali. but it's ok. i think she's enthralled in her cutting out of magazines. that's the problem with random on the mp3 player. it plays songs that i don't even really like, but maybe liked at one time, or it's a song that i don't like of a group i like. always chooses the bad ones. i hope that people don't walk by the door and hear this music and think that i have bad taste in music. i'm sure that i know more than so many people on this floor who think they know stuff just cause they know artists who are really new but in reality have been out for years, who i've known about for so long. i wonder if i used the who correctly. is it supposed to be whom? i wonder. i bet that the readers are having a hay day with this. what's that supposed to mean anyway? a hay-day? i actually don't really care about that. so. when's drew going to call? i think i'm getting antsy because i have about 5 minutes left. and i think i can't think anymore. how would that be i wonder. if you couldn't think. i guess you would be doing nothing? it boggles my mind. and for that matter. you can't ever be doing nothing. reminds me of that phantom tollboth book. . the kid was told to do nothing, so he just sat there. but by sitting there he was doing something. just not anything of great importance, i guess. wow. that was a great book. i wonder if people realize it's greatness. i say wow a lot. ali's excited because this song i'm listening to said amarillo, and she's from little borger. this is a nice song. the random function actually picked a good one. i wish i could do that little sound that people do with their mouths. the one that can call horses. . i can't do that. ali just did it. man. almost done. yay!! i wonder if it's still stream of conciousness if you keep checking on the clock. . it seems like it'd be interrupting the stream by looking at it. i don't think that makes a lot of sense. but then again, i don't think that much i do makes a lot of sense. or say rather. i need to dry my hair. . and yes! i can do it in about. . 10 seconds. yay! i'm free ",1,"[-0.068139, 0.717967, 0.490854, 0.237097, 0.874395, 0.089552, -1.323495, -1.429027, -1.470474, 1.318026, -0.26833, -0.081715, -1.505143, -1.452878, -0.968114, 0.0, -0.04277, 0.003045, 0.067513, -0.795527, -0.142998, -0.128245, -0.151519, -0.158076, 0.087918, 0.225114, -0.947217, 0.035472, -0.011629, 0.887123, 0.296875, 1.298165, -0.966611, -0.630577, -0.643403, -1.109326, 0.9923, -0.807514, 1.537578, 1.060381, -1.038726, 1.879529, -1.092484, 0.29196, -1.216725, 1.969276, -0.68909, -0.260119, 1.456577, -0.555997, 0.153448, -1.333757, -0.21389, 0.014252, -0.85749, -1.42587, -0.873883, -0.533288, -1.074627, 1.338224, -0.786454, -1.400392, -0.182285, -0.474139, -0.546834, 2.302684, -0.086094, 2.11202, -0.409071, -0.073676, -0.23436, 0.305859, 0.248278, 0.515177, -0.422267, 2.216215, -0.451544, -0.408772, 1.929214, 4.542354, 3.582557, 4.749695, 4.822538, 4.894924]"

"i hate driving in austin. there is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. people are so impolite when it comes to cars. jay just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. and now i have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. my mom didn't want me to take it with me. i hope the body shop does a good job. that is my main concern. i had a headache this morning. i think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. my roommate was being nice to me this morning. jerry told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. and boys are so much trouble. why does sak always have to do this to me? i think i will finally answer his question truthfully now. i thought i had been, but he was right, i'm still hiding something. i don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what i want. and then he says not to want anything. why must he always try to be the good guy? i don't know if he is telling me the truth. if he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? this boy is driving me nuts. i don't understand why he keeps doing this. deep down, i think i know the answer. but i guess i hide from things a lot. people always say i hide myself. sak says i hide myself in questions. i do. i never answer personal questions. i answer them with questions. i don't know why. maybe i do need a psychiatrist. i think too much. i think i scare sak. because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. i don't like her. she doesn't like me either. i've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. she looks at me funny. i think she's stringing him along. that's why he does this to me. but then he told me i was wrong. he said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. i think it scares him to let himself go. for some reason i think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. he saw through me hiding behind questions. but i think it's because i don't doubt him. i trust his opinions and his thoughts. that's something i don't do with most people. i trust him. which surprised me. it usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. maybe because i am always hiding. for some reason i think he has the key to unlock whatever it is i am hiding. and i think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that i can't open myself. that's what i want, i guess. i want to tell him the truth but i can't. because like him. i am hiding. we're both hiding. only he does a better job at it. probably because he is a guy. why do i trust him? i don't understand that. but sometimes i think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. why do i trust him so much? i think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. i remember when i first met him; i was not attracted to him. he looked cunning to me. like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. but then i think he also has the heart not to. that's why i think i started to like him. he has a good heart. and i think that's one quality that is hard to find. oh my gosh! i guess this answers his question of what i think about him. i think i will give him a copy of this one day? i will tell him the truth. the entire truth of what i thought when i first met him until now. but i also want him to tell me too. because i don't want to be the only one who opens up. but i don't think that will ever happen. i think my twenty minutes is about to be up. and i have such a bad memory; i don't remember anyone's name. i feel so bad. why can't i remember? that's unfair to me because people know who i am but i have no idea who they are. i need to work on my memory.

" i feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. i know i'm supposed to write about what i am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. i don't usually tell anyone how i am really feeling ever. i'm worried that i might not be studying as much as i should be. i don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. i mean i know i could read the texts, but i really don't think that would do me any good since i have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. i hate math. i don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. he is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. i don't think i'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. i miss my boyfriend a lot. he is going to school in el paso and i'm not going to see him for at least three more months. i tried living with him in el paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. i was going to go to school with him, but i decided to move back to austin because we were starting to hate each other and i missed my family a lot also. it's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. i really don't understand it at all. i wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. i know i need him and he needs me, and i really hate it. i have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but i know the truth even though i would never admit it to even my closet friends. i wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. she was so excited when she got hired. i really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what i am thinking. i mean who really cares anyway? people are always asking you how you feel, but i'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. i know lots of times i ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. i hate when people look at me in queer ways. i always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. i wish i didn't care, but i do.

"alright, today was a pretty boring day. i feel really unsatisfied with my classes because they do not stirr any special interest in me. i thought i would be excited about at least one of them but not yet. i guess i am just a little mentally tired. i was so happy to get back into the swing of things and try and find my friends. acutally i think i expreienced a fake high because i miss mexico a lot. i was there for the last half of the summer and made some amazing friends. i miss my boyfriend there too. i keep wondering if he is going to send me the ring he supposedly bought for me. hopefully he will. i really want it. he told me he loves me, so i just hope he does not forget about me because i will never forget about him. he was so nice to me. all of my friends like him and besides the whole , he has two kids, thang everything is alright. i learned from him that no matter how serious skeletons in your closet might be, your heart wins overall. you cannot talk yourself out of loving someone. i guess i really cared for him more than i ever cared to admit to my roommate who thought i should of broken up with him. too bad she ended up traveling around with some random guy around mexico who she met before our language was over. her guy has had at least 28 partners. if anything, she shouldn't of met her lover boy in oaxcaca, mx. as for the rest of my dating life which seems to be my main concern these days, it is hella-active, like cartman would say. this weekend i met some awesome guys. i am waiting to hear back from them. i can still hardly believe that i gave my number to a cute waiter at papadeaux. i must be crazy. i usually just date around. i would love to find just one special person. i also need to workout more. i have been partying too much. mexico was one big one month long party. now i need to get serious about studying and try to find some interest in my classes. everything seems to be running in circles in my mind. i am constantly thinking about boys, classes, and my friends who i really need to call and catch up. i can hardly believe i haven't talked to my closest friends in a month. it really feels good to get back in touch with them even though it is only over the computer. i am soo tired. i wish i could just take a nap and wake up stress free. all of these issues running across my mind are really stressing me out. i constantly feel tense. i hope i do not end up with some horrible health problems like my dad's family. today at work we had to take a personality test and i scored high in a section that appearred to be stress. i do not know what the category was but it started with an s and i am starting to stress out about even that. my body hates the beginning of school because everything feels so out of wack! man, i already need a vacation. i am too tense for a 19 year old going on 40. surprisingly i am not so nervous about the begining of the year but i can feel the potential homework overload slowly stressing me out. i am scared about my classes and i really need to get motivated instead of nervous. writing down my thoughts is starting to stress me out. i am going to be so happy when i can submit this and check my e-mail. then i can hear about my crazy friends' lives and take a break from mine. boo i have to wash my hair too and that is such a chore too. i wish i had naturally straight hair and legs as built as my dad. then i would have hardly anything to worry about. i feel like such a basket case because i hardly voice my inner thought to anyone and i can hardly stop. i guess i usually set mine aside in order to enjoy a small vacation from my life and enjoy hearing from others. i really want to talk to my friend lindsay tonight. she helps me forget about everything and just laugh out loud and be abnoxious without being self-conscience. my laugh is louder than the average laugh so people usually stare at me when i open my mouth and chuckle a little. i saw people looking at me tonight at dinner when i laughed. oh well. they must be jealous, yeah right. i need to live a little. in mexico i did everything i could ever dream of doing. i climbed a volcanoe, developed a love of horsebackriding, enjoyed my daring side, and much more. it sucks to have to slow down for school and dive into reading material i would rather use as a pillow. oh well, my studying today will pay off tomorrow. right? right. i need to take a nap. i did not get enough sleep last night and am drifting into lala land slowly. there is a fire alarm. i have to run. it just stopped, maybe not ",0,"[-0.11, 0.547009, -0.406554, 0.71997, 0.011592, -1.317064, 0.578516, 0.183094, 0.523435, 0.878775, -0.187788, -0.393922, -0.086336, 0.999598, 0.96595, 0.0, -0.04277, 0.787103, 1.030919, -0.438905, 0.969506, -0.049442, 0.313821, 0.43742, 0.580941, -0.309268, 1.251169, -0.191036, 1.644854, 1.344927, 2.840722, 0.108731, 0.9486, 3.134324, -0.38403, -0.547942, -0.371729, -0.656003, -0.395604, 0.199164, 0.235988, 0.215111, -1.5163, 0.016948, -0.469067, 0.240506, 0.503525, 0.88196, 0.752373, 0.343746, 0.722198, -0.542658, 0.261226, -0.118856, 0.518887, 0.668658, -0.109055, 0.470688, 0.203108, -1.201374, 0.174994, -0.247898, -0.480161, 0.478176, -0.242631, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.325318, -0.394274, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.401638, -0.232087, 0.143726, -0.422267, -1.408797, -0.451544, -0.408772, -0.668399, 5.100603, 4.496342, 4.610119, 5.189326, 4.617029]"
"well this is the first writing assignment of the semester. you had said in our first meeting that we could write out a rough draft before we submitted this copy to you. i figured that since this is a stream of consciousness writing that it would be best if this were written straight to you without proofreading or rewriting. well today i got back from visiting home for the labor day weekend, i'm feeling really homesick right about now, i think it's even worse than when i first left home for the first time to move to ut. but i'm sure as the week goes on, i'll adjust again. i think that as the year progresses and i visit more often, the coming back to school when the weekend is over will get a lot easier, because it will become i routine type of thing. have you noticed that i've started all the paragraphs, with the exception of this one, with the word ""well""? i think that's a word i use to start off thoughts that i don't know how to start off. i don't know if that's good or bad, but who really cares, right? this isn't rhetoric. the first football game is this coming weekend, my first longhorn football game ever. of course i've seen games on tv, but being at the game is always better and more exciting. just the like the san antonio spurs, i always watch them on tv, but being at the game is so much fun. i just learned this weekend that someone from my graduating class is in my psychology class. this isn't a person that i ever talked to, in fact, i never even knew who he was until a good friend of mine started dating him. i'm guessing he saw me in the class when we first met last thursday, i didn't see him though, as you know, there are 540 people in that class. last night as i was falling asleep, i started thinking about the homework that i need to get done. then i started thinking about this writing assignment. i couldn't fall asleep because i couldn't remember when this assignment was due. in my head i continuously thought, ""is it due the 15th or the 5th?"" of course, i've always been this way, i always seem to contradict myself. in elementary school, i would lay awake at night trying to remember if i had finished all the work that was assigned to me. i would literally get up every night to check my backpack to make sure it was all finished and that i had put it all into my bag for the next day. i have a feeling i'm going to be this way in college, my biggest fear is failing. i know that if i work hard, i won't, but i can't help feel this way. wow, has it been 20 minutes already, yes it has. i got a class in 20 minutes. this was fun, got to go.

"hmmm, what should i write. this is so hard for me, but i think i'll make it work. that guy just signed on again, and i won't be surprised if he sends me an instant message. but i really don't want to talk to him. the refrigerator is making this humming noise that always bothers me, even when i'm sleeping. i hope that my roommate sleeps over at trey's apartment because i don't want to hear her snore. there is somebody talking outside, i can hear them even way up here. i should turn off that light by my bed because if it burns too long everything gets too hot. the creaking of the walls here bother me too. and now some girl just ran down the hall. the airplanes can be really loud here because we are so high. i don't understand why people can't shut their doors quietly or push their chairs in without making so much noise. i wonder if anyone is going to call me in the middle of this. that would make me lose everything. those people that call that person next door are really pretty stupid. they let the phone ring like fifteen times. in a small dorm room is that really necessary? my typing has gotten so bad, i hate to capitalize. i should have sent that letter on saturday, but i was just too lazy to bring it down there. now it's going to have a weird date on the letter that doesn't match the postmark date on the envelop. i guess i'm not the only one that does that though, so it's ok. my feet are cold. they are always so cold. and today the girl next door was complaining about how hot it was. i am never hot in this room. there is some humming coming from outside. i wonder if it is just a bus being idle right now. my computer just got more energy or something because it made some noise. people are walking in the hall now, i can here them. these walls must not have good insulation. there goes a loud car that was revved up too quickly. that doesn't make sense to me. i should wash my dishes. i wonder what my neighbors are talking about when they just said ""that's really bad. "" my wrists are starting to hurt, i should probably change my hand position. i also should do my laundry. the rest of my laundry. i need to wash my towels. i wonder how long i would have to wait in line for the stuff. probably too long, i think i will just wait till another day. that girl just coughed again. that makes me think that i should buy some cough drops. i am getting sleepy. i wish i wasn't so lazy. my eyes feel like their drooping. i wonder what the score is on the cowboy game. i need to sit straight so that my back doesn't hurt. i wish i knew why my back hurts so much, i think it must have been that sunday i helped dad. i really wish i had eaten something other than burger king. i should have eaten subway. i enjoy tuna subs better. i just yawned. i think i need stamina. my watch is digging into my are. i now have a whole impression of my watch in my arm. that kind of stuff annoys me. this watch is too little. it is made for little kids. i'm going to close my eyes while i type. i hope i don't mess up too many words. that would a bad think if it couldn't be read. i need to get a haircut, i want to get it styled, but i'm scared that the way it will be done won't look good. i'm taking off my watch now, it 's bothering me too much. why does my stapler have such a big crack down the middle of it i wonder why the mail didn't come yesterday. that makes me so mad. i bet i would have had mail. this gum is tasting pretty gross but it tastes better than the burger. yawn. now i have goosepimples. why am i so cold. i should probably put on a long shirt. why doesn't my camera rewind all the way. maybe i should just get a new one. one of those advantage ones that i can take to switzerland. that would be great for all the scenic pictures. yawn. why do my eyes water so much when i yawn. that is very annoying. there goes the telephone again. i bet it will ring for a long time. nope it only rang once. i guess the girl is there now. my computer just froze up kinda, i bet i did something wrong, i am always doing something wrong. i wonder how fast i can type without making lots of mistakes. so far i am doing pretty good. why is it whenever you say that you get worse. , the second i said it, it got worse. now my wrists are really hurting. someone is going into their room, and the just slammed their door. that just bothers me so much.

"english is my second language. probably i'll have a few grammar mistakes and phrases that don't make sense. i've just watched a really good movie, it's one of those movies that really keeps you thinking. but anyways i don't want to talk about that. i don't know what to talk about. i'm having lots of reading, i chose lots of reading subjects, but i'll be able to handle it. it's just a matter of organizing correctly my time. the more busy i am, the better my academic results are. it has always been like that. if i have lots of things to do i organize my time better than just sitting there in front of the tv. doing practically nothing. i love that though but i prefer being busy and having lots of responsibilities. this semester i'm not only taking 15 hours per week but i'm also in a student organization, in belly dance class, in intramural soccer besides from adapting to this new university-freshman idea. i like this task. it seems pretty pointless and useless but i like writing whatever. in french it would be best defined as n'importe quoi. i love france. i really miss that country but i don't think i'll ever live there again. i don't know why i have this strange feeling that i'll stay here in the us. i don't really want to but i know that i'll end up finding a tempting work here. i'll marry a guy from here as well. i don't know it's just this sixth sense i have. but life gives many turns. life is like a box of chocolates. you never know what you'll get. hehehehe. forrest gump. i wonder what tom hanks is doing right now. his last movie was a couple of years ago. is he doing a new one or is it just that he has retired and is dedicated to profit of what his career has left him? my mother, she might be thinking a lot about me. i know she misses me but at the same time, she is really happy to know that i'm here. following my dreams"". florent. when will i'll be able to dump him? it's just something extremely difficult. i'm used to his weekly calls and although i don't love him, i like having someone thinking of me. i want a boy in austin. i need a guy. i like compromises and being with someone. life turns easier when you have a boyfriend. don't you think? i realize that i'm a very dependent person. not on my family or my friends but on men. or a man at least. if i were a man, i would have my own harem and i would be surrounded by them. sounds pretty cool uh? i think that in a future life i will be an extremist feminist (if you understood that title!) and i will fight for women's rights. not in this life. (it's one of this strange feelings i get) but in a future life. in this life, i'm going to dedicate myself to succeed in life. what is success for me? it has something to do with prestige-power-money. i am someone who qualifies for those 3 things. i will get them. i'm an ambitious person. i end up getting what i want. we'll see, we never know. life is like a piano. depends on how you play it. i am all philosophical today with this box of chocolates, and the piano and this superficial phrases that are very commercial but are always useful when you can't explain something. like religion. holy sake! what a complicate thing that is! how many wars and deaths that usually brings?! what a stupid thing. like today 9-11 i think a lot about that and about pinochet as well but whatever, religion is the opium of the masses. another commercial phrase but very very true. marx and his communism! that was about it for tonight. i have to continue reading hobbes and his political system for my quiz. my life is being reduced to reading and reading and reading. but i like it, as i said (and this is to emphasize it) i like having responsabilities.

"there is drilling in the hall way which i find just irritating so much, i also find that i hate computers and i shouldn't have been born in this time period, but yet again all the technology i have now i can't live without. but i do find that man and woman both are getting lazier and lazier, we are all looking for a short cut to everything, i saw on a commercial that you don't have to scrub your toilet anymore because they invented some cool thing you can spray right into your toilet and poof all the yucky grime that forms around the toilet disappears. also they got that fresh shower thing so you don't have to clean your shower anymore at all. so if you don't want to go out and drive to the grocery store you can go on line and order your groceries. i remember once this randall's peapod truck fill with some lazy person's grocery came by our house looking for directions to someone's house. i found how funny it was that people are willing to pay people to grocery shop for them. grocery shopping to me is one of the most easiest things in the world and i rather enjoy it. lazy people! see this was why amazon. com was going up 15 points a day two years ago. thanks to lazy people, amazon. com stockholders were rich, but now amazon died down a bit. ok i did shop at amazon. com once, i'm not a big fan of sending out my credit card number across cyber space, i just don't feel safe, it's that insecurity paranoia i have. but i guess shopping online is sort of fun. but i feel that things are getting much more easier and i'm getting much lazier. i come to ut and everything is like technologized if that is such a word, but i mean i can pay may bills online! and register my classes online, and heck you got a website to make my life easier. i'm for extra help, but to mean all the stuff to make my life easier is bumming me out, i wonder if i am as smart without the technology because it's like the other people living way before or going to school at ut before all the new tech stuff was offered to them. i mean every student almost has to have an email account, i still don't know how to get to mine at all. i'm so computer illiterate and i want to be a mis major, isn't that an oxymoron. one day i know that i will have to eventually have to buckle down and start learning how to work a computer and not ask people to help me with it. i told my teacher once that if my computer ever breaks or my phone doesn't work i'll just hire someone to fix it, then he said to me, why don't you be the one that fixes things, some people make a living doing things that other people just rather hire people to do and they are making a fortune out of doing that. i didn't under stand that at the time it took me i think five years to figure out what he meant by it, then again i forgot what he said and then miraculously i remember what he said about some months ago and it made sense. it's weird that i have very few scattered memories about my childhood. i remember bits but never complete parts. it's more like images than anything mixed with sounds almost like a dream, damn drilling! sometimes i wonder if my early memories are actually dreams i had and i couldn't distinguish the two. sometimes i have these dreams that feel so real and sometimes i have these dreams where i know that it's really a dream it's so weird. i wonder is coma people dream about when they are in a coma, do they dream at all, i know that this could be answered if i were to research it but i'm lazy, and i'm sure that if i do some exploring on the internet i could find a website that is dedicated to answering this question.

"sometimes, i don't understand my ex-boyfriend. he tends not to tell me everything, especially the ones that he thinks i shouldn't have to worry about. maybe it's because we didn't have enough time to know more about each other before i left. a lot of times, i sincerely wished i had known him earlier, and things between us could have been lot better. when we were together, i didn't think i would miss him that much even if i came back to us. but, somehow, he knew i would miss him. but i really didn't realize how much i miss him until now that i am back here. i couldn't call him nor email him. the only thing i can do to keep in touch with him was write letters. it takes about a month back and forth. and one month is really too long for me. i want to know how he is doing and if he misses me as well. i wish he could come here to see me. but i know it's just my imagination to something that's almost impossible. even though we never really talk about how we are now since we are so far away from each other, at least, i know that we are still good friends.

"my roommate and i have office space"" on. what a great movie. it cracks me up every time i watch it. i really like my roommate. she is such a cool girl. it's weird how things work out. i was really scared about having a potluck roommate. every day we find new things that we have the same. we have the same toothbrush, hairbrush, hair straightener, contact case, pair of pajama pants, caboodle for our makeup, pair of shoes. it's crazy. i really like living at srd. the food was really good tonight. we had this thing called ""mexican shrimp"" except it really didn't taste like mexican. it was just little shrimp in this sauce with red and green peppers over rice. food is so good. i bought some little debbie star crunch and some vanilla wafers at the store today. little kids snacks are so much fun. i wanted some fruit snacks but they cost too much. meghan (my roommate) and i are not having a good experience with fridges. our first one leaked all over the carpet so we bought a new one but it gets extremely cold and halfway freezes our stuff. this morning i got out a dr pepper and it was all icy. we should read the manual and fix that. i'm excited that i am going home tomorrow for the weekend. i miss my family, especially my sister. this past year we were closer than we had ever been and then i had to leave. i don't have class on fri so i am going home to see her cheer at the garland football game tomorrow night. i'm so proud of her. she is so cute and nice and always succeeds at the things she does. i also want to see my puppies. they are the cutest dogs ever and i haven't seen them for 3 weeks. i am also ready to sleep in my own bed. although my dorm bed is comfortable, it isn't the same. hahah- gosh i love office space. the characters are so messed up and hilarious. i don't know why we have the tv on. i am doing the writing assignment at my computer and my roommate is doing pretesting on her computer and we are both just listening to the tv. i really should go to bed sometime soon because i have an 8am class tomorrow. it was easy for me to get up for high school at 7:30 last year but for some reason i am having a lot of trouble getting up for my classes. i guess i am still in summer mode. now the credits are rolling on the tv and neither of us is getting up to turn it off. i shouldn't leave instant messenger up when i am doing homework. my friends keep talking to me but i am doing this so i can't talk to them so the boxes just keep flashing at the bottom of the screen and it is really driving me crazy. the music on the credits is also driving me crazy. there is just so much rap music i can take. oh man! barenaked ladies is coming out with a new cd and they are coming on tour to austin and i am so excited. i love their music so much. i do hope their new album is good because each new one seems to be more pop-ish than the last one. i love their old cd's when they were just in canada and hadn't crossed over to america yet. their concerts are awesome and i will be going to the one here. i should probably start saving my money. i guess that means i should get a new job. all i know is that i will never work in food again. i worked at sonic for 2 years and it drove me crazy. i would come home smelling like grease and who knows what else. yeah, those i'm boxes need to stop flashing. this is one of the most random assignments i have ever done. i probably sound like an idiot with everything i am saying. i really do like my dorm room. it is so colorful and we have so many pictures and posters up. i can't stand blank white walls. the walls in my room at home are blue so being here with white walls is annoying. i should really put some lotion on my legs because they are itchy. the only problem is that i hate lotion. that is my weird thing. lotion and feet. put the 2 together and it is an even worse thing. my sister makes fun of me but i make fun of her because she doesn't like anything touching her bellybutton. she won't even touch her bellybutton. now our room is completely silent except for the clicking of keyboards. i feel like we need some music or something. i'm glad that meghan and i have similar tastes in musics because i wouldn't want to annoy her with something she didn't like. it's been hard finding a radio stations i like here in austin because i don't really know which station play what kind of music yet. i guess i have plenty of time to learn. well- my time is up!

"right now i am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. i really wish that i had worked on this assignment earlier. i am now starting to worry because i have to finish calculus homework and read a few pages for engineering. and i have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. it is bugging me that i left that one problem unfinished. it is also bugging me that i left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. i never thought about that before, but i do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. weird. i just had an epiphany. it is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. like a word you've never heard before. take before. before before before before before before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. that is really odd. and it works with every word, too. hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. not thinking of much anymore. i used to think of how much i missed home. now it is not so prominent. i don't think of roshi as much. i still do sometimes. but it comes and goes. i am not going to let myself get trapped like i have before. it is just a vicious cycle. i feel much better this time. i have somehow learned to overcome sadness. i dunno exactly how it happened, but i have learned to overcome and bypass it. it doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. now that i think about it, i am really starting to wonder how i managed to do that. inherently, i think that i can get fixated easily; that right there is a sign that i am bound to get hurt one of these days. and i have. but i have learned. the question is, how? hmm. oh well. no matter now. as long as i can do it. that is good enough for me. maybe its the college atmosphere. being alone and on my own. in a sense, anyway. i look around my room and realize that i do not miss home. i don't know why. i missa family and friends at time, but i don't miss them. its weird. maybe its because i don't consider myself away from them. mysha said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on labor day. maybe i need to stay away from home longer. hmm. that must be it. mysha got me thinking about roshi again. hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. it can't be too hard; lots of people have already met people. i jsut need to go and try. steve knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. comes natural to him though. i honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. i feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. i am liking the way i am handling things, liking the way i have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that i can make my own decisions. i am starting to feel better and better about college life. it is great. except for all the people. there is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. a sort of fakeness. many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. people don't act the way i am used to seeing them act in high school. maybe that is it. asians don't act like asians at home, for one thing. most other people act the same, but the asians here don't. a little different. a little meaner? that can't be it though, i really need to meet more and judge. ugh. i feel like i've just cursed myself for saying that. i really didn't mean that. i am being too cynical i guess. but you can't win them all. i am happy otherwise; i have met a few good friends, i like the campus, and i am close to home. i feel connected in all aspects. ut was probably one of the best choices i ever made. my dad thinks so. he told me the other night. i always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. he usually is, i've learned. almost always. i need to learn to respect that. i'm the one who's usually wrong. oh well. better late than never. time for calculus.

"i feel tired. a lot of school work. too many distractions yet no love, the one distraction i want to find. yet sometimes i don't want to find it. sometimes i just like to have fun and not get tied down by a relationship. but most of the time, when not with friends, when not with family, when all alone, i feel like i want to find the right chick. i feel hungry. won't eat though until i finish this writing assignment. started at 9:34. it is now 9:36. i have 18 minutes left. that took a while to think up because i hate math. i am not taking any math in college because i don't need it for predental. but i have a lot of chemistry. again, i have a lot of school work. never really worried about it until now because i procrastinated. the next two nights are going to suck. 9:37. damn. only a minute has gone by. really hungry now so i'll take a bite real quick. but i'm still typing with my right hand. i'm also really annoyed right now. i can't stand my roommate. he's a total loser. i can't wait to move out of here and get my own place next year. there is no way in hell that i'll share a room again for the rest of my life. i hope married life isn't going to be like this. like i said earlier, i really want to find ""the one,"" and i feel like i need to in the next couple of years because that's when most people do, but the whole sharing a room experience has got me wondering. if marriage life is going to be as annoying as this, i'm going to be pretty disappointed. i mean, i never get as annoyed by chicks when i'm in a relationship, so maybe there's hope. roommate just came back. made a lot of noise so i lost my train of thought. it is 9:42. i started at 9:34 so 8 minutes have gone by. i'm amazed at how much i can write when i just write what is on my mind. roommate still in here making even more noise. roommate sighing and shuffling feet hoping to get attention from me because he sees i am doing homework. now he is ruffling potato chip bags and being louder hoping to annoy me even more. i'm still ignoring him, but now he has gone over to his computer and is blaring out music. again, he leaves to the sink and makes more noise over there. i'm still ignoring, but i'm getting more and more pissed off. now he is talking to himself aloud and coughing and typing extra loudly to again draw attention to himself. how childish. now he is tapping loudly. like a little kid trying to get attention. he is really pissing the hell out of me. i swear, there is no way in hell that i will ever room with someone in the same room for the rest of my life. damn, i just got a phone call. i'll have to call him back. man, i haven't talked to him in a while. he wants me join a frat. i wonder if that's what is call is about. okay, 9:47. i got 7 more minutes. well, my mind is pretty blank right now. i'm just thinking about what went on today. i went to lacrosse practice. and i bought some beer. my roommate thinks i'm an alcoholic because he doesn't drink so he doesn't know what an alcoholic is. at least all my real friends don't think i'm one. i miss my best friend hilary. she's at a&m right now. i've always had a crush on her. i remember daydreaming about getting married back in elementary school. she was the first girl i saw when i moved down here to tx. she never knew who i was until high school. then we became best buds. even though we're best friends, i think, actually, i'll be honest, i know that i still have a crush on her. pretty middleschoolish, but who knows, maybe one day, she may be ""the one"". at least i wish she was. i can't wait to see her again. i never clean my room, but she's coming down in october so i'll be sure to clean it by then. girls are my weakness. i love chicks. thank god there's so many here at ut. its funny that i feel lonely sometime, even though i've met so many girls here that want to hook up with me. its just that the chicks that want to hook up with me are so plain. i dated beauty queens in high school and maybe its immaturity, but i can't date anybody who doesn't fit that beauty queen mold here at ut. although i am wanted by some chicks, i'm still lonely sometime because they're not the chicks i had in mind. i guess i'm too choosey. plus, i guess i like feeling sorry for myself every now and then. i used to like to cry at night when i'm alone, but now, knowing that i'm wanted, that's a thing of the past. well, time's up.

"i woke up this morning and i'm thinking. ""where am i?"" and then i realize that i'm at a&m. i was so upset last night because i left after class got out at 6:30. then everything went wrong. the trolley cart fell off the steps and all of my stuff went crashing to the ground. i got in my car and the needle was practically buried to the red empty sign so i stop to get gas, then i decide that i had better eat something because as soon as i get there everyone will be ready to go out and i will be starving as usual and afterward no one will want to stop and get poor little old me anything to eat. and boy was i right. audrey says it will only take and hour to an hour and a half to get here. yeah right. try two and a half. someone goes off and gives me the wrong directions that takes me all the way to hempstead! i was so mad at myself because i finally make it here, but i don't have directions to gayle's or audrey's or their phone numbers. i found audrey's and ginger answered which was exactly what i didn't want to happen. she bothers me. we used to be friends, but then i don't know what happened, it's like all of a sudden, the only thing that she cared about was who she was around and how much she could be seen doing thins with natalie and amy. but now that she's up here all by herself she sure decided that audrey and gayle and i were perfect people to be her friends again. i just don't know i mean that i don't like that i feel that way as far as the fact that she just gets on my nerves, but i don't like being mean. i will tell her how i feel, now, because she doesn't seem to have a problem being rude and snotty to me. i went to audrey's and i wish i had a house like gayle or an apartment like audrey & ginger. it's nice and filled with a lot more space than my dorm, but then again i kind of like the woo. aurora and raya are so nice. they take care to notice if i'm upset about something and they talk to me about it. it just doesn't make me feel any better to know that their mothers don't call them every night after nine o'clock just because they just happened to get one thousand free minutes on their portable phone. it's not that i don't like my mother calling, but she calls all the time and tells me to go to bed of all things. little did she know that i have stayed up until 3:oo every night since monday, and last night we got home at 2:30 but didn't go to bed until 4:30. i don't know what she is thinking because she actually could not believe that people stay up until all hours of the night studying. i had to let her in on a little secret. all of those nights she thought i was asleep, i wasn't.

"i mean, each day i wonder why i am here on this earth. and then other times, i wonder why i go through some of the stuff i do go through. it seems at times that the ""good"" people get the worst parts of life, while the ""villains"" in life seem to get the better things in life. that bugs the hell out of me. then there is love. something that is near and dear to me. i look around and i see great females who choose to stay in relationships with guys who treat them like ""scum"". it's so ridiculous sometimes. the worst is when these girls as for the nice guy, but when one comes along, they ignore him and guy for the guy that may boost their social status. sometimes i guess the girls out there that are like that deserve the treatment they get. other than, life seems great right now. every piece of the puzzle is here. except one thing. i have no one to wake up for each morning. but other than that, thing seems to be falling into place. i use to be a person that required love and what comes along with it. but after my last relationship, i have learned to take life a lot easier and just ""chill"". sometimes i might take it to an extreme and therefore i do get myself in trouble or do things that make me disappointed in myself. i worry that this new ""care-free"" life may eventually take me over with it's great appeal. but only time will tell if that will happen. most of my close female friends feel that i have changed to a more fun and loose person, but at what because??. some feel i have already changed too much and have become a totally different person. i do see myself as changing, but the core of who i am has not changed and hopefully it will never change. i feel that my beliefs and morals and etc are still the same. i have changed a few beliefs, or i should, i am considering changing a few beliefs i have, but it's nothing to strong. it's more like how i choose to take life and what i think is important. but some of the beliefs that i am considering changing or what has my friends worried. because once again, they feel i may become a totally new person and become a person without the same sympathy that i use to possess. but like everything else in life, only time will tell. but i see my myself as evolving rather than changing. make sense??. it's like i am becoming a stronger person. especially emotionally. i am still as sensitive as i used to be. tears come natural for me. but as far as love and stuff. it's not as blinding as it used to be. it's like i gained ""sunglasses"" somehow as i evolved. even my poetry has changed with my evolution. my first couple of works were specifically about love and what goes along with it. but my most recent collection focused on death, suicide, and the afterlife. i wasn't at all suicidal or anything. but the artistic side of me wanted to try something different from the usual love stuff. but it seems through everything i do, that i have matured. i am less likely to hold grudges than i used to. i have pretty much become friends with most, but not all of my past ""grudges"". i guess once you get out of high school, things you once considered important seem ridiculous now. kind of odd huh??. there were people in high school that i would have died for and would have died for me, but now we barely talk. and then there's the people i never talked to much, but now i spend most of my time with. it's weird how one summer can change so much. but i guess this past summer ""weeded"" out the friends who weren't really friends. the friends you have now are the ones that will stay true to you for awhile. or at least until something catastrophic occurs. i remember in high school, i thought my click would never break up. we were almost like brothers. but now we are like strangers. maybe time will change things back. or maybe it was just meant to be. but as of now, my life seems to be a constant vacation. yea there is classes and stuff, but everything is so laid back. there is no pressure whatsoever. not yet at least. but we'll have to see how all that goes. life is a mystery and i doubt anything will ever make sense. just take whatever opportunity you get, and never postpone anything until tomorrow. cause you never know, there may not be a tomorrow. and one should always keep their mind open to anything. the most sure people in our world have changed their minds. sometimes our past or the facts that are presented to us can alter our opinion on matter. however, it's okay to have a strong belief about something as long as you believe in it with you heart and nothing more. a lot of people today are just followers. they believe what they are told. they don't think for themselves to see if what they are told makes any sense whatsoever. many cases in history have resulted badly. look at world war 2. the entire country of germany followed the madman named hitler. he was a lunatic, but one has top give him credit for being able to convince a whole nation that he was right. then to convince them to allow him to be dictator. the sad thing is that, that could still happen today. maybe not with the same ""material"", but if a person said the right thing with the right motivation, any country could fall. even the supposed ""untouchable"" u. s. a. nothing is untouchable. just like how nothing lasts forever. nothing ",1,"[1.137889, -1.857438,

"i know that i have assignments to take care of but i do not want to complete them. i know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, i still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. but that is were the apathy sets in again and i will not take action. it seems like a cycle that i know at my house. my dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, i could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. i do not blame him, i just see a pattern that is similar to mine. but at least i am working now. i still have german 506 to complete that is were i am most suffering. i need to review, and starting to catch up before i wind up failing. it would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. at some point i have to break this cycle but sometimes i don't think i will. but i must press on. if i don't turn it around, on my own now that i am in college, i am afraid i never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. i have to start putting my foot down. tonight was a good start. i told my suite mate who i am very good friends with that i could not go see a band play with him. instead i opted to stay home and do work. however, only now i am beginning to work on it. that is very disappointing . it seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. i will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. it will be very nice to get away. the depravity of this city seems to be catching me. or rather i am slowing down to let it get me. waco is a much different society than austin. i cannot be lure d away. then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. waco has all the same trappings, i just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . now i can fall and it doesn't look that i will stop. i cannot think like that. but any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 3 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed i need to work ion to improve myself. i just know that this cannot go on or i will star5 to pay some very hefty consequences. my dad always told me before i left for ut that i would be greatly affected t by the people i surround myself with. i can see how this is partly true but i do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. i will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. i will be in control of what it is i will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. this is the time for me to start caring. i am not sure what else i can talk about. i have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. my mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and i need an escape. perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. i don't believe that i have much longer to continue writing on this assignment. two very large priorities for the even9ihng that i still have to take care of is my german, which i have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow i return to work and i need better clothing than what i am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. it may seem late, but if i am outrunning that new leaf, i am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. my mind is growing blank and i believe that i should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic.

"i think about my mother, my ex-boyfriend in houston(of whom i'm still in love with) and just things that are going on in my life right now. all of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming. and for some reason during all of this i listen to the most depressing tori amos or sarah mclachlan song. after a good cry i always feel better, i think it's healthy to cry though. i think it's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy. dealing with things, for me, is the best way to get over them. but sometimes i tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out. i seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when i would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me. my parents got divorced at that time, about when i was 11 years old or so. i remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because i missed her. she and i have one of the best relationships i've ever seen between parent and child. she is my friend not just my mother. but i don't cross boundaries, i respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance. i think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit, use it to their advantage, i just respect it and cherish it with all my heart. i quote sarah mclachlan, ""and i have the sense, to recognize, that i don't know how to let you go. "" i think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year. we've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other's lives at some point or another. i guess it's a good thing, he's a wonderful person and a great person for me. but i just don't know if i can do this (be in love with him have a relationship, what have you) with him being in houston and me here in austin. i don't know if i want him calling me telling me how much he misses me, and telling me he loves me when he's two hours away. i guess it's not that much of a distance compared to other people's long distance relationships, but i think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those. i certainly know they're not for me. and from his past experiences with them, all bad, i know he's not too keen on the idea either. i miss him terribly, touching him, smelling him, his humor, his voice, everything. e-mail and phone conversations don't suffice. i just got a new laptop and i wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and i hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing. ugh! i hate this thing, but i really don't i like having it to take to the library. i just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do. i'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things. they just don't interest me that much. i'm much more of a trial and error person. except when it comes to math basically because i don't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out. i want a formula there for in my face. we're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now. it's a total bitch. i made three really cool friends in that class. one of my friends tim i saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together. i wish he were cuter, he's a really nice guy. and i made these two other friends tracie(same name as my best friend) and stephanie. they're both really cute, and tracie seems like she'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with. she was telling me about her cousin's friend who's gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion. imagine that. but i would love to go to new york. especially after seeing that movie a perfect murder , i mean i know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on central park but i would love to just go visit it. i love the whole image of it, it's just very chic for some reason. i would live there if i could get a very high paying position somewhere, but that's the only way i would. it's just too crowded otherwise.

"well where should i start. first of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that i have ever had to do. i'm not even sure what to write about. my day started at 6:30 today because i have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then i went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then i had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if i didn't have plans. so after my class i went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a i'm flag football team. well anyway, i'm not even sure if i'm doing this assignment right because all i am doing is describing what i did today. any way i really enjoyed today's material in class. at first i wasn't sure if i would like the class but now i really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. considering that i have and extremely hot instructor for my rhe 306 class. its crazy hot attractive she is. but now i'm thinking about another girl that i have a crush on. today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. i'm not sure if she knows how i feel, but i'm having a hard time reading her. usually i'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. i also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because i had been wanting to talk to them for a while. things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. i am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. on yeah, i got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. my dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. my mom called on her way to a bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl i have crush on this weekend since she is going home friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what i really meant was girl i'm attracted to. what's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since i was in 10th grade. and every time she would tell me i would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that i'm into her it kind of sucks because now i have to put much more effort into it. now don't get me wrong, because i'm not trying to make it seem like i'm am lazy but i truly am not used to putting in so much work. i know it may sound cockeye but if it does i'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or i'll type and you'll read later.

" right now i am sitting here typing, with the tv on in the background and i am feeling very tired. i think this is because i didn't get nearly enough sleep last night. why didn't i get enough sleep, you ask. well i don't know. i usually go to bed sometime before eleven, or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve. i guess you could say between 11 and 12, right? yeah. and i start my day somewhere around 7:30. that is not nearly enough sleep. but what's funny is this is the only time of day when i feel really lethargic: around 5 or six o clock. maybe it is biological. maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies. i think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in mexico. that seems glorious. not to mention it's good for you! you are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy. even as i type i can feel myself drifting off. do not fall asleep. do not fall asleep. oh great. i pressed a wrong key and now the time started over. i had two minutes of typing under my belt. that's beautiful, just beautiful!!! i think i will just sit here and make up for that time. doop de doop. doop de dooooop. . . . . . well, i'm very glad it's friday tomorrow. not that it makes much of a difference, but still. i can sleep in on the weekend, that's a big deal to me. i'm not sure what i'll do with the weekend. probably catch up on reading for classes. i'm really concerned about that. i've been slacking off a bit and that's just awful, classes have only been in session for what, just two weeks or something. yuck. i'm such a procrastinator. well, i don't know what else to talk about. this is boring and i'm getting bored just doing this because i'd rather be napping. not to mention the clock says only 3 minutes and i know the true time should be somewhere around five!!!! here, this is entertainment. i will type out a poem completely from memory. ladies and gentlemen, the road less traveled by robert frost: two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler, long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way i doubt if i shall ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i, i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference. what a beauty of a poem, no? i've always liked it. don't remember why i had to memorize it. probably for a class way back in middle school. some people have told me they don't understand the last line. i just feel secret annoyance towards them. what's there not to understand?! it's clear as a bell, people! i like robert frost. here's another one i know called fire and ice: some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what i've tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice i think i know enough of hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice i also like stopping by woods on a snowy evening, the one that ends ""and miles to go before i sleep. "" yep. also that poem called nothing gold can stay. why do i know so much about robert frost you ask?! heck you got me. i don't even know. i just think his poems are nice. what other poets do i like. that's a good question. i have no idea. well, that's probably not true, but i can't think of any at the moment. in decathlon in school we studied lots of poems, by langston hughes and sylvia plath and robert frost (a really bad one, though) and george meredith and lots of other peeps. some of them were cool, some were most definitely not. i think i will write a poem of my own, right here, right now. i call it ""the cat came home"". the cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he didn't know was that the owners had moved away they left the lights on they left dishes in the sink the cat came home and in a swift minute didn't know what to think should i stay or should i go the cat asked himself that day what should i do about this what should i say? well the cat found no answers just an empty litter box so he said, eh who cares and tore up all the socks maybe i should get that one published! well my time is almost up thank goodness, so i should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment, a summation if you will. this was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why i don't get enough sleep. yep, that's all. nothing too exciting. and what do you expect. there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on tv at this moment.

"well this weekend has been really different. i guess that's because it was the first"" actual weekend that my friends and i actually went out and ""explored"" austin. i know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't ""explored"" austin, but i think it was better this way. the first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. it was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us. she had in a way ""made new"" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in austin. what was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. i don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving austin (the party was in san antonio) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. i was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. i feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. i guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. people are responsible for making their own decisions here. no one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. these people are adults now and can think for themselves. i also know that another reason i didn't want to or even want to go home until i really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family, especially my mom. i know that i'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time i talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last thursday, i felt like i needed to cry. i don't know why i felt like that. i know that we're very close but i really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. i also have another worry on my mind. one of my guy friends had be accepted to the university of houston and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. my guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. and this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and i, nearly every day together. or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. to me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but i don't know if that would be normal because i haven't really been in a relationship like that. well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the university of north texas in denton). every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. and my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. and of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. well the university of houston started two days before we did and that monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to denton. and he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. what we don't understand is why he decided that. this is his first relationship and they already have given each other ""a promise ring"" or a ""promise gift"" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. what my friends and i don't understand is what is going on through his head. well my time is almost up. i have like ten seconds left so i guess that's it.

" i smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you can't be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor. well i got back from a bible study got to see some people that i haven't seen in a while i suppose it made me feel at home and i actually made plans to hang out with someone i met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much. anyways i enjoyed it but at the same time i wonder about my relationship with god i suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind. is it strong enough to i pursue him enough am i a good person sometimes i don't know. so i'm listening while i do this music seems to be something that i have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, now even though some music doesn't appeal to me i believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations. so lets get real i'm an 18 guy so i do also think about girls quite a bit. today i thought of a girl in high school i missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend. even though i don't know what the hell i want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress. i don't know? but i can't deny my feeling i believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life. sometimes i feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, live life love life. so as i continue to right i remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life. i find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each other simple glances are rarely seen. what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life. so many lonely people. what do i like: the smell of rain, the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins, the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living i met an 80 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he didn't want it to end. i agree some people have forgotten that but i hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for, someone to love, something to give, man being a kid was freaking awesome and i could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing. i wish i had a glass of milk before i went to bed but hey what can you do. well there went 20 minutes i suppose i will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry garcia ""live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful.

" i am at a study hall room at the time wondering what i will think about that i am going to write. there are people behind me talking and one went ole miss which makes me think of a friend of mine from high school who is a freshman there now. i wonder how he is doing now along with all my other friends that is not attending ut. there are actually several people going here from my high school but i only see about half of them on a regular basis. i am a little stressed with all the things going on because i have done the thing that everyone has said not to but i think no matter what it happens to everyone. it is just the thought of all the freedom and then all of a sudden a couple weeks go by and there are quizes, tests, and papers due at the same time. i am also stressed about so many different things such as a typical college freshman is. one guy said that his fine arts was theater and dance. that made me think about when i was confused on what to take when i was signing up for classes. people ask me what this is that i am typing because they can read exactly what i am thinking. i am actually hungary with all these people talking about food. is kind of a word? not sure but it should be. i just found a phone on the desk but completely forgot that it was mine until i opened it up. i lost my phone a week ago so i don't have any of the numbers that i used to have, i hope this is not being graded for correct grammer because i am trying to type as fast as i think. i have already been typing for 10 minutes already and am wondering what else i am going to talk about. i also don't know what class i am going to drop, which haves to be done tomorrow. i cannot take 16 hours that i am currently signed up for so i will drop one to drop down to 13 hours. a friend of mine just called saying that he cannot make it to lunch. a guy is just now sitting beside me and he is about to start eating something. that makes me hungary again. he is reading everything i type and just corrected me on a mistake. i am running out of things to say or talk about. i am thinking now about my place and hearing some stories in the background. most people are done with their homework and are asking me questions about this assignment, i am actually kind of comfortable right now at the computer. i don't have a computer yet at my apartment so it is really hard for me to get to an actual one to do assignments and get notes off the internet. i have yet to figure out how many notes to take from class since everything is different in college. i have a lot of stuff to do like go to walmart, the grocery store and other places to get caught up on everything. only a few more minutes left until i am done with this. i wonder again if this is for completion grade or even if it is going to be read. i bet the counselors read all these to see if we are all okay since majority of the class is freshman. wow, i cannot believe that the twenty minutes is almost up. i'm going into a blank thought because of this pressure that the timer is putting on me for some reason. what else should i say?

"what about this school, too many people running from place to place to be of any noticeable . meaning, any noticeable effect. i can't find the word trying to scribe all my thoughts brimming down. it is much easier for me to describe the pictures in my head, the vivid sensations i am accustomed to beholding within my minds own personal theater. i have developed my own way of thinking, so i like to think!, through day dreams and images, which i behold clearly even with my eyes open as if they happened in front of me. i like to write, but not this droning nonsense which may not receive the benefit of human eyes except for its execution and if, if it gets read. i am told it might not be, and it is this insignificance which repels me to the assignment. at least its easy, except for the internet part. i have generally avoided this dismal institution for my years, i spit upon the ""net"" when it first gained its genesis, and i spit upon its multi-media, machination which steals the waking lives from people. but what of it, for that matter, they do it to themselves, i can not pity them for that. if they like computers to sunsets let them use paintbrush to engineer their own nature, but i prefer the real thing made of so much chaos and chance that these simple number-crunchers couldn't make anything with that much sensation, that much depth. that is what lacks in these computers, they are vicarious to life. not that i condemn them, they are useful tools, and not that i condemn their junkies or pushers for the fact of the creation, and not that i live my life to its fullest potential as it may sound i condemn the computer junkies for not doing. its just that, i guess, i have found my own niche in the wall of the world, my own peaceful way of doing things that is inhibited by the computer only slightly, in the way that i hate it and most embrace it. i am hypocritical in this matter as well: i own a computer myself, and use it nearly every day. i like to think, probably falsely, that my downfall in the machine is not so complete as those web-surfers who spend 8+ hours browsing the electronic dreams of men. but then, my won mind produces the dreams i live in: whose to say which is worse? i prefer to see pictures of the world inside my own mind, and i can contrive any number of vicarious situation, locations, persons, emotions, sunsets, anything i want with a near vivid copy of the real things my eyes behold. is this the same as the infernal computer? is this any less debilitating a habit to daydream in ways even more real than my own, insignificant life? i say insignificant, and i mean it, not in a degrading matter or that i don't feel i have made full use of my potential or that i want for a better standard or situation in my own life, but that it is the truth that all humans are insignificant, no matter how important or influential, save in the numbers of our immense crowd. i'm sure philosophers have pondered the subject as i do right now for a useless computer, but as i have mentioned, i prefer the daydream, i prefer the novel, and i prefer the realistic sunset to a game of doom(not to say that the particular pastime isn't fun, i'm just as guilty as wasting an hour or so, but i haven't followed it up as many have with the endless assortment of clones that rock the computer gaming industry). i am bored with writing this as though i think in words, because normally i do not. normally i prefer to think in sight, in sound, and even smell(though that's a hard one to master, i don't think i shall). so now i think its time to stop this wonderment i have going and describe what i think about when i don't do it in words: flashing colors, sometimes geometric-shapes, until i can find something to build the energy in mind into. i remember during psych class when i began to waver off(which i am in habit of doing, sometimes at the wrong moment), daydreaming about my kendo class coming up soon. i thought about a stalwart master standing over me as i held out a bamboo sword, poised straight and steady. i though about going over the moves i knew so well, i am quite a fan of kendo and cannot wait to take the actual class. i hope, though, that my daydream will predict some of the success i hope to have, but i still recognize that it was not real, only a contrivance, and i will have to wait for the fact to see. back tot he daydream i enjoy remembering, and have thought about since. i then imagined as though i were past the class, but somehow not in the real world as we know it, but somewhere where the sword still ruled the land. i think now it must have been my own idea of feudal japan, but needlessly i walked around in nothing but a (i forget now what the karate uniforms i have donned so many times are called) but i was wearing one of those, carrying a real sword this time, trudging through muddy roads through a country side constantly lit by an orange, pasty sun. i can't remember where it went form there, but needless to say much violence, honor, and success followed. that's how my daydreams sometimes run, but sometime they are more erratic. sometime i let my mind go, though i do have extensive control, and watch bizarre unfoldings before me of pictures melting together, sometimes a forgotten memory boiling up from the depths of my mind, but more often a collage of unearthly landscapes. i have done extensive travel in the southwest of our country, sometimes willing, sometimes not, and have amassed a great many memories of the landscapes. enough memories, in fact, to create my own realistically, though vicariously, through my daydream ability. sometimes i imagine titanous walls of huge cliffs, eaten away by a river evidently, but impossibly showing the scores of rain as though it were eroded by that force alone, topped with greenery though the valley below is of rocks and tumbled stones. i like to visualize. i like to visualize so much that on the last vacation i made special note to remember the best landscapes i saw, and discovered in the process that i couldn't remember the scenes if i wore sunglasses. without them, i could remember the sharpness of shiprock, the depth of the grand canyon, the crumbling stones of chaco and mesa verde. but with sunglasses on, i found i could not remember the details, they seemed clouded and sometimes distorted as thought he glass stole away the true definition of the pictures i wanted to remember. that is the unfortunate part of my visualizing saga, sometime i mar and twist my own memories into fantastic visages only seen in movies, and then find i cannot twist them back. sometimes i remember the waves at galveston quite a bit larger then they really were, the sun at the most vivid sunrise i recall that much brighter and golden, though taken from the special effects house and spliced with my memory. and i wonder which is better? to have the memory unaltered or to have the memory better, improved and refined into something so stunning to remember or think about that i might include it in stories. that's how i write, too. don't think out the story, i see though it were a movie flashing before my eyes, i hear it though a speaker were plugged next to me, i feel it though i were in it myself. sometimes i think about conquering the world, so much to the fact that i have it all planned out. i feel safe writing about here, because it is doubtful anyone will read this carefully or pay attention to it, but i am confident enough of my long-term plans that i would feel bad if someone didn't have the warning. maybe just fancy, but we will se won't we? if not, then i'll die a normal life, or maybe get a few books out and receive some fame, not as much as i'd like the money though. i'm sure i've met the twenty minute interval, but i forgot to check the clock so i'll keep writing a little longer to be sure to satisfy the requirement. so now i will daydream for sure, and write it as i see it, as though it were happening. no, i better not, it would probably appear too much like my writings, but i will go ahead and make-visualize a new landscapes like i did up there(earlier) because i enjoy it so much. i see a rising pyramid, sitting atop a four-cornered stone terrace that hold the point towards a sky with two suns, one burning bright and vaguely familiar to our own, the other a hazy blue color, lazily sitting near the point. surrounding it is the ruins of a city, not egyptian though, but more reminiscent of the roman culture, with tilted columns and ruble returning to the desert. the sand is a yellow with glitter, like mica flecks imbedded in the sand, which is hot tot he touch but not ruff, it runs like silk through the hands. my hands? i don't know, i just watch. the valley surrounding is windswept, though, perhaps they must be my hand because it appears quite desolate. the wind whips the sands into speeding wraiths across the amazingly flat area around, somehow no dunes develop, though. i wonder how that could be. i said valley, but i do not see any moutons or hills around. i wonder what prompted me to describe it as such. if i were writing a book, i would have changed it or added in a distant mountain line, but not so here. the sand seems compacted though, to the foot, though a hand can easily dislodge it, though it seems to flow back into place. it reminds me of the black sands of california, more gray then black, but equally as smooth and mica filled. perhaps that's where its glintiness comes from, a mixed memory of tv and actually physical things i've seen. sometimes its is, most times, though, it is merely illusion, merely contrivance, so i will let it go at that, ",1,"[1.422294, -0.921188, -1.661993, -1.373496, -1.735639, -1.549893, 2.024432, 1.753069, 2.009527, 4.34356, 0.024962, 0.639229, -0.931273, -2.022052, 2.112899, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.79854, -0.493789, -0.263829, -0.592032, -0.742368, -0.728953, 0.989645, -0.624052, 1.946577, 0.59408, -0.64235, -1.218115, -0.734072, -0.83909, -0.155631, -0.956781, -0.906028, -0.807927, -0.551337, -0.068442, -0.66406, -0.24217, -0.287244, 1.706451, 0.431418, -0.97434, 0.191628, 1.076448, -0.557999, 0.040338, -1.48897, -0.620174, -1.055571, -0.786079, -0.832091, -0.402248, -1.669796, -0.361153, -0.463971, -0.922279, -0.010036, 0.055828, 0.480904, -0.646312, -0.032066, -0.480161, -0.593204, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -1.174149, 2.546747, 0.088748, -0.23436, 0.006991, -0.302507, 0.220469, -0.163292, -0.914514, 1.240591, 0.391075, 0.142938, 4.059444, 3.725829, 4.226232, 5.147561, 5.907072]"
"wow i'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that i'm listening to some allman bros. very loud as well as the st. louis ' denver game in the background but what the hell why not. i was thinking about what the hell i was going to write about earlier and i guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness. ha. well anyway i probably should not stop writing. it's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body (especially your hands) because sometimes i will think of something and begin typing it and then i will forget what in the hell i was thinking about until it's too late. the same thing even happens in conversations, and that sucks a big fat hairy one when i'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing i was watching last night and then i will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth. hmm it's very tempting to get lost in watching that clock in the upper portion of the screen. i keep seeing it tick away the seconds and it makes me want to look at it. i find all of this internet stuff veryu fascinating, especially since i am fairly proficient in it. wow, this feels almost like an inner monologue because deep down in the back of my consciousness i know that i will be the only one reading it, so i get almost this pointless feeling to myself as to why in the world i am even putting forth any effort into doing such an assignment. hmm that was the third time i have corrected my spelling. i wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment. typing is such a weird thing. i do it so much that i feel fairly proficient, but i was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers. how does one get through life in any situation where he'she only types with two fingers. i just thought about what an ass i was last night. i was supposed to go to see keller williams with a fairly attractive, but fairly annoying and fairly commonly high girl a few floors up, but i felt really sick yesterday and the rain made me extremely lazy, so i told her in no uncertain terms that we probably wouldn't go to the concert even though that's all we had talked about the week before. i'm such a jackass ' loser when it comes to relations with the ladies. i don't know what in the hell that last thing was, but oh well. wow i wonder what a handful of other people i know here and at lsu are doing at this exact second? hmm eight minutes and thirty seconds. the death knell tolls in the background. as does every hungry woman off of the allman bros. ' first and self titles release. wow, i will type anything to keep the flow going. the only other time i can think of stream of consciousness in my real world experience is a brief relation in the sixth sense when that little haley joel kid writes down every and any bad word imaginable and that terribly boring and lifeless novel i had to read in 8th grade called the reivers. i can't think of the author right now, just because if i sat and thought i'd stop typing and that would defeat the whole purpose of this excercise. hmm president bush is on tv right now. how sad it is that people criticize him constantly. what a load of hypocritical, cynical assholes. wow, now i really feel like that little shit in the sixth sense as i constantly am using bad language. what a sad world i live in vocabularily (if that is even a word) if all i can do is cuss in a paper. i guess that's not all that i'm doing, but it is a lot of what i'm doing. wow, that was a complete waste of a sentence. as was that one. and that one. wow i could go on for hours like this. i don't think i have misspelled very many words so far. wow, i deserve a cookie. what a sad statement. this paper is riddled with psychological buzz words and phrases. what a head-case am i. ok, yoda, enough. speaking of yoda, jay and silent bob strike back was one funny, yet dissapointing movie. i don't know why i chose that one out of kevin smith's entire repituare (that is most definately not spelled correctly), seeing as mallrats, chasing amy, and clerks were fairly brilliant, and dogma was exceptionally interesting although quite blasphemous, but i guess that's why i was so let down by j&sb strike back. it's funny how your mind jumps from one idea to another. i was just thinking about when i could go back home and see the folks. for some reason, i only get homesick and depressed when i am severly screwed up, which is possible, i guess, because i can see more clearly, i don't know. and by screwed up i don't mean on heroin or crack which some may need to believe. i'd never do that hard shit (i think the bad language is necessary there, eh?) eh, what the hell am i, canadian. wait, no, canadian. i don't think they deserve a capital c. well, they get a lot of flack for no reason. so i guess i can say canadian. there, was that so hard. yes. more inner monologue. uggggh. 1. 5 minutes left. this is an exceptionally long feeling. i just got finished (before i started into this thing) reformatting and reinstalling windows xp on my suitemate's laptop. i enjoy doing crap like that. ever since i've been here it seems like there aren't very many computer proficient people like back in louisiana. oh well. time's almmost up. yep, time she is a up. we'll delve into this more deeply next week (by the way, that was something about mary. ).

"well i am sitting at my desk. it's kinda dark in here so i just turned on the lamp. i have a lot of homework to finish, most of it for the psych class. my homework has not been too bad so far. just a lot of reading. i am ready to go home and see my cat, i really miss him more than other things that i should probably miss more. my mom would get mad if she heard me say that, but sadly it is true. well my mind is a blank, i can't really think of anything to say i know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind, but my mind goes completely blank whenever i try to write anything, no matter what it is. i guess that is why i never could keep a journal or anything like that. i would start out the first day writing some, then it just tapered off until i stopped writing completely. i have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on. wow 20 minutes is a long time, its only been 5 since i started. i'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration, but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind won't cooperate. i guess that is what you are trying to figure out. it is ironic how the mind works, that is why i have always wanted to take a psychology class, so i could better understand its inner workings. i am frustrated that i really cannot think of a single thing however. i miss my best friend, faith. she is at oachita (spelling?) in arkadelphia. it is about 8 hours from here. i am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break, but that is a little hard without a car. i will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there. surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it (like they originally planned) and are keeping it at home (where it is currently getting no use). i guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time. i am only going home once before the holidays. that's only for my high school's homecoming. which i am kind of excited about. i know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game, so i will get to see them. that is the only weird thing about college. you realize how much your friends meant to you. it is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to. but, luckily i have met a few great people, and we have become good friends. i knew 8 people coming down here and only three of them i was actually good friends with. the other five were more acquaintances. i already semi-knew my roommate, she went to school in the same district, and we met through our parents. we have since become better friends. i am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things, but i figured i might as well write something. well let's see. i went on a mission trip to mexico this summer. i only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk. it was truly an awesome experience. i am a changed person because of that two week experience. well i guess i won't get into any other subject. my time is ticking away, funny how it goes by faster when you type. very ironic. and that is about all, thank you!

right now i am wondering how can i fit into college. i am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. now my mind is totally blank. i am wondering why i cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. i am i going to be judged by how i write this. does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. again i am stopped by the nothingness that i am thinking. its as if at one moment i am this intelligent individual and the next i am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. as i sit in my dorm writing this i am wondering whether or not i could be doing something else more fun. it is quite lonely in this room. for the most part i think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who i am. for the most part i have never been in love with a girl. what i want is exactly the opposite. i am ready for a relationship. now instead of going on about this i am reflecting on what i just said. i am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. but there are also very good things also. i think about how lucky i am to get such a great education from this university. i realize that not many people have this chance. i hope to really discover who i am in the next four years. i think that maybe the reason i have been writing all these negative things is because i am sick. i have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way i think. ok on to a different topic. i was just watching the road rules on mtv and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. i think this is the perfect case with me. in my family we never really showed any emotions. not once have i ever told my mom that i love her. maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. i feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that i have been close to. i don't really open my self up to anybody. all my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. my mom always said that i was shy. maybe she negatively reinforced why i am so shy. but enough about that. i was just thinking about an amazing experience that i had with my dad last week. i was in my parent's room playing guitar. my dad comes in and starts playing along with me. my dad and i don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. i was happier than ever before. my dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as i played along with him. it was such an amazing experience. well i think that i have run out of time. ,0,"[0.352564, -0.528852, 1.034633, -0.965646, -1.287967, -0.391702, 1.071413, 0.621166, 1.615649, -0.42762, -0.182767, -0.590446, -0.010931, 1.769931, 0.753872, 0.0, -0.04277, 0.362138, 1.197983, -0.507167, 1.127389, -0.182077, -0.746492, 1.229274, 0.025509, 0.448933, 0.062635, -0.273151, 0.151925, 0.486418, 0.17441, -0.600946, -0.291092, 1.104418, -0.676235, -0.655399, 0.807293, 2.012912, 2.715152, -1.472237, 0.335563, 0.705523, 1.188072, -0.677376, -0.264602, 0.05939, -0.724538, -0.122094, -0.518787, -0.72274, 0.782432, 0.216478, 0.240198, 0.299329, -0.931383, -0.621556, -0.168886, -0.954251, 1.501935, -0.016866, -0.887565, -0.506734, -0.480161, 0.244005, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.370105, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, -1.352153, -0.451544, -0.408772, -1.166392, 4.725027, 4.416377, 4.67707, 5.15978, 4.364867]"
"well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, i finally found one. unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. i can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!) i am smiling now. i always find irony amusing. they are still pounding next door. what the hell are they doing. he heheeheh-they just called us the 'fort worth girls' now that's funny stuff. i seriously have a major stomach ache. it hurts soo soo soo bad. i have been sick for like, three or four days now, i really feel terrible. my insides just hurt and every time i stand up i get dizzy. this computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. oh well i only have 13 minutes left if i did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, i probably did not do. i kind of feel bad that these people i don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. that's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it? everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. i wish my computer was working. it's really, really cute. it's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. i wonder how i did on my french test two days ago. i hope that i did okay. i am seeing all kinds of new people. isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you don't know and will never meet? i think that that is , well to say the least, strange. my back really hurts. i think , wow, coughing fit, that i will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. i feel so bad now, physically and mentally. i cant wait to go home this weekend. have my mom take care of me and see my guy that i am kind of dating. i miss him. he says he misses me. i wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. i said that i loved him but i don't know if i really meant it. i don't know if i could ever really love anyone. after all, i really don't even think that i love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. anyway, he has a boxer dog named romeo. very cute. i hate most dogs however. i love my cats. i miss my cats. i am glad i am getting at least this first assignment done. i cant spell for shit tonight. i also manage to talk like a sailor. oh well. i feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until i leave, i guess i wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. i wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when i leave. that must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, i guess i'll just be as nice as i can be. i really don't want her to hate me but oh well. oh hello boy in very very short shorts. that is so montreal. i am just in extreme pain. i want to work out and i haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. hello freshman 15, 25, 55. i'm all about gaining weight this year. my mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. maybe i just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. i want to go to france. i wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. i really must be very very thankful. i am such a terrible person. i really really am mean.

"" at least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and i've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. i don't get it. does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in asia? because that's what we're studying right now. bacteria. and it's not even interesting. i mean, who really cares about ers and lipids and lysosomes? well, i guess that's a pretty dumb question. of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. i personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. really, guy. but i have to take the class, whether i want to or not. i only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, i'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. ah, geology. my eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. after this, i have some serious catching up to do. and it's not because i miss my classes or anything. i mean, i don't even drink. except for wine, and that's really only when i eat out, which i do less and less these days. these dayswhat am i talking about?! i've been here for less than a month. it feels like i've always been here, though. which is weird. i love austin, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. seriously, they're nasty. and what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? they're not, most of them anyway. my neck hurts. that professor i was talking about earlier, the one who speaks english very poorly? he sings in class. right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. and it's not like he's singing to himself. i mean, he's wearing a mike. we can all hear him loud and clear. and the only song he knows how to sing is ""oh, what a beautiful morning. "" except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. he's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, i would never go to class. that's pretty weird of me, right?

"well here i am doing my first assignment for college. i really like it so far. i had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place. my life is like that though everything seems to just work. i don't know if i am the only person that feels like this (i doubt it) but i feel like i will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but i don't have a clue what it is that i will be doing. my dad seems to get pissed whenever i tell him that i don't know what i want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing. i think that it is because they don't fund my bill. my dorm room is freezing i am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such. my girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at (she had surgery) i hope she is ok. we have been going out for awhile now and i think i love her. i know that i am 19 and don't know what love is but it just feels so right. she is in her last year of college at sfa now so i will only get to see her once a month or so. everyone says to break-up but it is only one year then she (hopefully) will come to ut. i don't understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan. i mean maybe if i was one of those people that just love to be in love i would but it isn't that i miss the physical part (though i do) i miss her someone else won't replace that i want her not a body. now to bore you out of your minds, i am very interested in nutrition'bodybuilding. i played football for 4 years and weighed in at a fat laden 290 lbs. my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football. well i quit due to many factors and guess what it isn't ok to just be fat. i have worked my butt off literally. i now am 200 lbs and have gained strength. i estimate myself at 13% body fat but i want to do better and i know that i can. i spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets. i think it may be dominating my life. but it isn't a hobby it is a lifestyle. but really who else eats every 2 hours? and for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus i have these cursed dine-in dollars but i can only eat about 3 things here everything is terrible for you! i am not exaggerating ok maybe i can eat 5 things but come on! why do we not have fat-free cottage cheese? lean beef? real grilled chicken not the baby pieces i am paying for now. why is it always free pizza at 11 at night complex carb+late night=fat why no free tuna, or free vegetables? why is gregory closed from 8-12:05?! so what if i am not in the friggin weight class i know how to lift better than they do let me in! i worked in a weight room for 2 years you think i can't be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work-in etc? come on want to fight the freshmen 15? get better food! we were ranked last in dorm food last texas should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight. this is outrageous. ok now that i have ranted and let that out i want to know if there is anything i can do about it. no there isn't how many students would eat fat-free cottage cheese? or tuna straight from the can? not enough to get the food people to bring it in. oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy! something just buzzed in my room. my hands are numb spend the a'c $ on some real food!

"i can't stand how removed the users are from the control of the system. with internet explorer i can't even get it to work with trumpet winsock, so if i want to use ie then i have to go down to the computer center and pay them a bunch of money for the ut connect system when i already have trumpet winsock that has always worked fine in the past. now with netscape i keep having a completely different problem, there are several times that i go to web pages that i know are there and they aren't for example i tried to go to the pretesting webpages and i soon as i sent my social security number out over the web, which i'm not especially happy about having to do, it tells me that the document has no data. the same thing has happened before when i try to log on to the columbia house website. i consider myself a pretty smart person, but i cannot figure out at all what the hell is going on with this stupid then. i know i have to go down to campus and use a computer down there for 45 minutes to do the pretesting. and why the hell is it when you connect to ut and go on the web the connecting is so freaking slow. i swear ut must have some really outdated equipment down there because my download speeds never get over 1 k. that's ridiculous. but this is the way at ut. when you go to a school with 50000 students everything takes a little longer and your chances of having to deal with an idiot are raised considerably. i think i have an especially low tolerance for stupid people. uneducated is different but there seem to be a lot of people out that that are truly student i think, and they frustrate the hell out of me. it's not that i'm a genius of something, but there are some real idiots out there. there is this girl in my engineering economics class that sits up in the front and will ask questions that make no freaking sense at all. how in the hell does someone get to be an upper division engineering major and be so stupid. obviously it happens through, although most of the really stupid people that i have to deal with come from working at wal-mart. i guess that's my own fault, it's not like i should expect anything else. when i was a csm we would have some cashiers that i have not idea at all how they got hired. i think personnel hires anyone with a pulse sometimes, i mean if the person sitting across the table from you just has this completely blank look on their face, that's a good sign that you shouldn't hire them. another thing that bugs me are all the stupid laws regarding alcohol in this country. i mean either it should be legal or it should, but alcohol seems to be the only think that is legal to some of the adults and only part of the time. i mean were are talking about adults, some of them may not be especially bright but they still are adults. if 18 is good enough for every thing else then it should be good enough for alcohol. you can get married, go to jail, go to war, own property, get a gun, hell anything that any other adult does except drink. seems pretty backwards to me. something else that is freaking stupid and at the very least unfair is the way that car insurance companies can completely screw over guys. when a girl turns 21 she gets a good rate, but a guy has to wait until he is 25, hello but most of the really awful drivers that i have ever been around are women, they are the ones that pay no attention at all to what is going on around them. but since older people control the laws etceteras the younger people are going to continue to get screwed over, i think they should make people over 60 pay the same rates as 18 year olds, that would be funny. oh well out of time, it's been real ",0,"[1.221183, -1.614264, -1.244964, -1.624497, -1.510222, -0.597211, 0.970665, 1.008437, 1.072449, 0.200964, -0.00349, -0.590446, -0.206819, -0.273811, 0.361022, 0.0, -0.04277, -1.915086, -1.864965, -0.573191, -2.122039, 0.553643, -0.263938, 0.526436, -0.123218, 2.046706, 1.408176, -0.103438, -0.052934, -0.917015, -0.772634, -0.151058, 0.941233, -0.906028, 1.616854, -0.759332, -0.66746, -0.564387, -1.123844, 0.050903, 0.55071, -0.09843, 0.671268, -1.579246, -1.130134, -0.801514, -0.809015, -0.211089, -0.816155, -0.160669, 2.64038, -0.76478, -1.258232, 0.560379, 0.276179, 1.890433, 0.639611, 2.599251, -0.987368, 2.12889, 0.697163, 0.366981, 1.615244, 0.017511, 2.108332, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.986167, 0.24858, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.137244, -0.422267, -0.679542, -0.451544, -0.408772, -1.017228, 4.430559, 4.00692, 3.991575, 3.961756, 5.296287]"

"as for now, i feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. i had many things to accomplish once i started school here at the university of texas and i am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as i achive the goals i need to. for instance, today, i needed to petition credit of hours which i earned off of the ap testing which i took in highschool. i attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though i typed the correct web site, i could not actually claim my hours. thus i actually went to the measures and evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, i was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card i purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening i finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now i am a much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, i began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in cicago ilinois. i am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. i remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times i feel that i can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything i need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends i know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. i do the same thing. i care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother, he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. i miss him a lot. actually i probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed i would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could i not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. i really miss them. in addition, i miss my friends which go to different schools. i keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. i am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. i'm very close to my mom and that is why i believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and i hope that whatever i choose to do with my life i can impress her. however i would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that i will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that i can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that i can.

"basically right now i am feeling a little bit stressed out. i have to go to this fiesta tonight for my sorority and i think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up. i have no idea yet what i am going to wear. on top of all of that i have class pretty much all day today. my freshmen seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries. for some reason i am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school. i don't know if i am behind or if i will be prepared for the tests or what. i always thought that i would have so much more time in college because i wouldn't be at school for 9 hours a day, but for some reason i never seem to have enough time. and wow, right now i am really tired. i wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so i could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen. i'm also pretty hungry so i need to decide on something to have for lunch. we really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food. i could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason i don't just love that food. i mean it's not really bad, but i just don't really like everything that they have downstairs. i'm really glad that we have the kitchens in towers because i like being able to make my own food. now i'm back to worrying about what i am going to wear tonight. i should have thought about this a lot sooner. i tried to go get something yesterday, but i couldn't find anything. from now on i am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner. my problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and i always have class in the afternoon. oh well though! i'm pretty excited about tonight, but i really just don't want to stay out too late. and then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on friday so i think that should be really fun. i'm excited to see her. i've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but i am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and i can't wait! now i am seriously getting so hungry. as soon as i finish this i am going to make some lunch and i then i have to do some reading. reading is really the only homework i have, but it is so time consuming and i feel like i always kind of put it off. i don't know why i feel like that because i am not really behind in my reading or anything. oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying, i guess i never turned it off. i wonder if there is anyone here. i know my roommate is at class, but i'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not. it's really quiet so i'm thinking maybe not. i am definitely going to go get a coke and some lunch after i finish with this. i am so tired, maybe the coke will wake me up a little bit. goodness, i just wish i knew what i was going to wear tonight. i think maybe i'll call my sister later and see what she thinks. i just don't know though. my zeta bud never called me which is strange, but i can't go to the activity today anyway because i have class. oh well. i think someone just walked in. i wonder which one of my roommates is here. i will have to go check on that and then i have a lot to do before my class at 2. i also need to find a map to where i am supposed to go for my seminar discussion today.

"my love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as i sit here and write this assignment. i don't understand any software but everything for ibm, and the macintosh is completely foreign to me. i must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey i am new to this whole apple thing. apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. every time i type the word a lot, i am reminded of my english teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. i'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that i should have written it as two. i think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. i see a lot of people around campus just like that although i remember their faces and words, for the life of me i cannot remember their names, and i would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, azi, do you remember me?? more than likely i would not, or i would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. i do that a lot. people will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before i responded by just looking up. my thoughts consume me sometimes. i have a problem with daydreaming. i know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. it is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. i was talking about my thoughts, and how i daydream. well, lately all i can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man i am to marry. it seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. i have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. i went to a summer church retreat, and i think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because i met guys for the first time that i could honestly see myself marrying. this has never happened before, and as i glance around the campus, i just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and i am here longing for there company. it is not like i need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. i miss them a whole lot because i have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that i met at this church retreat in california. i think i forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout cali, and i have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless i actively seek a job to where i can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful golden state of california. all of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and i miss them terribly. i have to go back some day, i haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as i had in california. i know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little bit of why i would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason i would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a baptist church, or a jewish synagogue embodies. that spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. it would be ideal if i could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and i stress this because that is a big part of my life, but i am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. it's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, i am not asking for the ken and barbie playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, i just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. i just don't think that i can have that right now, and that is why i spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. the challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. and if i may i would like to end with a statement that linda ellerbee made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes.

"i want money. i like money. what is the easiest way to get it? winning the lottery is too hard. maybe i can get a wish to come true. a wish. where do wishes come from? i hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards? where would one find a leprechaun? if i found one, how could i catch it? it must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. they must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- i wonder if they drink. a drunk leprechaun. funny, the life of the party. granting wishes for everyone. what wish do i want? what else? money, happiness power? power is good. maybe i could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. i could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe i don't. i just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. two kids. maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it live off interest. that sounds good. i could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. i like sleeping. but the time goes faster when i sleep. do i want to go faster? no? yes? maybe? definitely maybe. i don't want to miss anything, but i want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. i'm too lazy to have to work for a living. i don't know how i'm going to get through it. all of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. but i only just started. preparing for my future. the future is a fantastic place. it can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if i know what i'm talking about. people die. kill eachother. why? to what end? everyone dies. what difference does it make when? i would prefer to die later in my life, though. i guess i want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. in the next millenium. nostradamus says the world will end. soon. i want to see if it happens. that would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. not as it is known, but in some form. a science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. as long as its well after i'm dead, i don't care who has it. the world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. media tells us its not coming, they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us there's no cliff, that were running towards an open pasture full of wildflowers and pretty white bunnies. but i know the cliff is there. thats something else i want to se before i die, or as i die. will the world survive? will man kill the earth first, or will man kill man first? one way, nothing survives. the other way, the earth survives, and possibly a few men, to carry on the race. i know who i'm rooting for. i want man to get to that cliff and go right off. unless it can slow down, or run a different direction, but for now, the cliff. but that should be after i'm gone. i don't have to worry about anything. if only i could catch that damn leprechaun.

"i have realized that my computer at home is a lot slower than my cool computer at school. i miss my computer at school, but at least this one does not have annoying pop-ups like that one. ah! i am angry at christina for downloading a stupid program onto my computer that had hidden programs. i am at home right now and i am happy, i miss being able to shower without shower shoes on. everything is a lot more clean too, at least that is how i feel. i think that that's just because i am used to home. oh my god my typing skills have deteriorated i think so have my spelling skills my head itches and i just washed my hair so now its dripping all over my shirt, because i am too lazy to blow dry my hair. speaking of which i need to bring my blow dryer to school so i don't sleep with wet hair because that gives me headaches. today on the bus back home i was feeling nauseous hmm i do not think i spelled that right because i was reading my psychology reading hehe that's what i'm writing this essay for anyways i was feeling like i you know having to capitalize all the it's is very annoying and my weird keyboard is not helping very much either o yah so i decided to take a nap so i would not throw up. i miss my house. i hope tomorrow i will be able to hang out with my old friends who are still at home! many of them have left already except the ones going to west coast schools. lucky people they are, except they will still be in school in june when all of us are out! i told daddy about the normandy scholar program that i was interested in, but i knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply. i think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes, but i know it is for my own good because oh! i might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me, but seriously, if i get into a really bad accident there should be people in europe who would help me by the way the normandy scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in europe going to old world war ii sites and you learn about world war ii, which i think is interesting partially because i seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff, maybe that's why i like ender's game so much. but i also like band of brothers! which got me interested in world war ii in the first place! and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war, but more like a battle. i'm thinking about bringing my dvd's to school, but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because i'll want to watch them instead of studying, like how my roommate and i stayed up until 2:30 for the past 2 nights watching chinese soap operas. i think it's really funny because i am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them, like when you watch anime, speaking of which i need to see if the next full metal alchemist episode is out or maybe i will just borrow it from my buddy. she's crazy but i like how she is protective of me. so i know that i hopefully won't get into any scary trouble! hehe it's like, now that i am away from my family at least i have someone i can trust to be there for me most of the time. i hope. i think. i don't know. maybe not that much. yea my hair is getting dry and now i have a piece of hair on my hand. i seem to be shedding a lot but i think that is normal because everyone else i have talked to say that it happens to them too. i just don't like how every time i wash my hair big wads of hair come out. i feel like i'm going bald, except i still have tons of hair, which makes me wonder how do i still have this much hair yet lose so much hair every time i wash my hair. because it takes a while for new hairs to grow as long as the old ones right? i wonder how much hair do we really have on our heads. i miss my sister and her friends this summer was really fun. even though i was only in california for about a week i really felt like i belonged there. it just seems so hard to go out and meet new people. i think i'm too shy around strangers. if i acted like myself when i'm with friends around people i don't know maybe it will be easier to make new friends. but i am afraid that eek i think i feel that i have a headache coming on. but i feel that i'll scare people away. but i mean if i'm going to be their friend they will eventually find out that that's the way i am right? i guess yay only about three more minutes to go. i think my contacts are getting kind of foggy. i should blink more. i wonder do hard contacts yah they do but i think they get more dry quicker than soft contacts. i think they might be dirty but wouldn't that make my eyes hurt? maybe i don't know i always cringe when they fall into the sink! ew so gross. and to think that i'm putting these into my eyes everyday! i forgot to bring my sucker thing home just incase my contacts got stuck in my eyes. but i guess it's okay because i hope guess think they won't get stuck. so i didn't really forget i just say i did. it's kind of like i'm like a pathological liar then? i don't know it's just easier to say things and not have to explain them because then people get bored and are like ""why are you telling me this"" so i just lie to make it easier. i wonder if that's bad?

omg the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up. i thought i was going to die ha-ha but i guess its a good work out plus the what 50pounds of books hahira damn good work out. man 9 minutes to go. good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because i think i am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world. but and english teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence. hahahaha ironic. he was a great teacher though i really miss his class. he had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes. more mature eyes . ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while . woke the class up. great teacher. i've actually loved all my english teachers in high school although i am horrible at writing and reading. but their classes were challenging and fun. everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me. although now at ut i'm a little scared. i hope i can handle it. i think as long as i can make it past the first year i should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years . right ha-ha. you know what this assignment reminds me of. the new tv show the days. how the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute. didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing. aww poor guy since he was a doc at such a young age. don't you ever wonder if kids like that miss out on their childhoods. i feel bad for them. seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now i know they are going to be exposed to the real world. and they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did. the real world is harsh. man if i could be 13 again i sure would. yet when i was 13 i remember wanting to be 16 and then wanting to be 18. and not that i'm turning 19. ohm depressing. last year to be a teenager. although i never really did all the teenage stuff. it was all to immature for me. but soon i'm going to be 20 and that means. reaching adult. you can't be called a kid anymore. all though i love to call people kid all the time its the greatest. people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary. well 20min up. i bet i look like i have add. prob. do. ha-ha ",0,"[-0.226036, -0.006945, -0.080135, -0.175271, -0.400392, 0.231428, -0.166954, 0.32451, -0.338662, 1.25744, -0.200978, -0.590446, -0.191505, -0.790837, -0.314344, 0.0, -0.04277, -1.432325, -1.215985, -0.474425, -1.410717, 0.193496, -0.130569, -0.302175, 0.099264, 1.236755, 0.034108, 0.213728, -0.25082, -0.427479, 0.082578, -0.9688, 0.118767, -0.066507, -0.447171, 0.154346, -0.698292, -0.103239, -0.50622, -0.584631, -0.656143, -0.595759, -0.08908, 1.025816, 0.948677, 0.41969, 0.549881, -0.41322, -0.37132, -0.207118, 0.854847, 1.171792, 0.439058, -0.679288, 0.440572, -0.129307, 0.778734, -0.52658, -0.219407, 0.200605, 0.25731, 0.023267, -0.177538, 0.080944, -0.27293, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.578541, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.119982, 0.673066, 0.046932, -0.297284, 2.614187, 0.496931, -0.214088, 4.458342, 3.940596, 4.563636, 4.6656, 4.87427]"
"just like everyone else's writings, i'm sure starting off with i don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like ""king kong"" or ""umbrellas"". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the ""hobbitt"" project and austin named one of the characters ""dildo daggins"". that was interesting because mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say ""dildo"" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. i wasn't in that class but i got to hear all about it. i really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. i think that says a lot about us. there are others that i've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying ""firewall alert"" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause i don't like computers to begin with and i can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said ""is that thing still beeping?"" and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so i went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause i couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds. i ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so i guess it worked out. i think i'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and i've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause i'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. i don't know where my roommate is, she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and i left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it's almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. i don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since i don't have a car. i called two of my friends to see if i could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. i wish i could drive her car but it's a standard and i'm not very good at them. i got my nose re-pierced last night, chasity (my roommate) went with me. i got it done when i was in ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $30! i wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. i took it out when i got home from ecuador because i didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and i know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so i decided to play it cool and take it out when i was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and i left it out too long. i really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. i have a white one i got while i was in ecuador that i'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. i can't wait to show my brother. i called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that i did it without him because i had told him that i'd get it done before i left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from chile. i really miss ecuador- i can't wait to go back, even though i don't speak the language very well i made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from chile, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person i'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak english- he is never had a formal english lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. i'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. i really wish i had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help i suppose. the time's almost up- i really didn't think i'd be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye!

"today has not been a very good day for me. i found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back. my friend and i caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm. this is one of the worst feeling i have ever felt. i am dating a boy right now, but the feelings for my ex have started to resurface. she fully knows that i like him, but she is deceiving me. i was very irritable today and i was rude to a lot of people. i really am not a rude person, i just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness. i went to pappasito's last night to pick up some to go food. it is sitting in my refrigerator and i am very anxious to eat it. i already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today. i love mexican food. i have a french test tomorrow. this is our second test. i thought i made an a on the last test, but when i got it back i found a much lower grade. it upset me, so i am going to study very hard for this test. right now i have a 4. 0 at the university, and i want to keep it as close to that as possible. i have noticed while typing this that i never capitalize 'i'. i have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times. i am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter. my roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and i wanted to go read some of her aim logs. so, i walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and i thought i heard her key in the door. i was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me. from that experience i have realized that i don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore. it would not be worth it if she came in and caught me. we already are going to be on semi-bad terms after i talk to her tonight about chris. one of our good friends thinks that once i talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing. he said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was ""too good to be true"". oh come on. she met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much. it just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship and goes after something that she knows will hurt me. last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her. she told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because chris is ""special"". that is what got to me the most. she is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 3 days ago. i am already stressed out enough with school, i do not need roommate problems. this is the reason i do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other. my guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this. when they try to get to me, they use force. like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows. it got frustrating, but i did not get emotionally hurt by it. girls get you in the worst possible way. tonight mean girls is showing at the union. i want to go see it so bad because i love that movie. it is so good. i would go see it if i did not have to do all of this homework. i already had a test last week in french, i am upset that there is another one this week. our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test. it is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework. oh well. i have not done laundry since i arrived here in austin. i am down to my last pants and shorts. i will probably do some tonight, if i don't get too lazy. i have treated this writing assignment as like a journal. i have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that i could write it all out. it has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly. my hand are getting kind of numb. i think it is because i never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now i have to. well, my time has come to an end. time to get back to more homework.

"its 12:42 and i'm listening to an old episode of saturday night live in my friends' room. i need a computer. i don't know why i didn't bring mine. i'm hungry. i can't eat because i have to type this assignment. sharon has a lot of pictures. this is a pretty funny snl sketch. i have nothing to say. my back feels a little sore. i'm slightly offended that there aren't any pictures with me in them. i don't want to do this anymore. i want to watch tv, instead of just listening to it. i really don't have anything important going through my head. it was nice of sharon to let me stay in here and do this. her and her roommate left, so i'm not even sure i'm supposed to be here. this song isn't that bad. i have never heard of the musical guest on this episode of snl but the song really isn't bad. i really should have eaten before i started this. i'm about to pass out. only 12 more minutes. i should call home later. i'm quite upset that i couldn't do the pretesting survey thing for the experiments. maybe i'll try again in a little while. i want to change the channel. some station has to be showing the u. s. open. they just have to. i think someone keeps trying to i. m. sharon, but i can't tell them it isn't her, because i'm doing this. i'm interested how this assignment will tell how my mind works. it should be good to know. i hope someone explains it, preferably professor what's his name. i would check to see what his name is, but again, i can't. just looking around the room now. this is kind of boring (no offense). only 8 more minutes. cool. the only bad part is i have to stay here until sharon and rebecca get back because i can't lock up. there are just a lot of pictures in here. there are many of sharon's boyfriend jorge. interesting that she's dating someone with the same name as me, isn't it. snl is over and only 6 minutes until i'm done. that is a stupid picture sharon has next to her printer. i like the opening music on this show (the kids in the hall). only 4 minutes left. that's good because i am still very hungry. this is very boring. i thought about using a lot of big words, but i realized that that isn't how i think so i should just stick with my sixth grade vocabulary. this isn't a very funny sketch. phone's ringing, can't answer it. they told me not to. it's rebecca. she knows i'm here but i still can't answer the phone. she isn't going to like this. i'm done.

" what classes do i take next semester? i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it? is it too much for me? i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what god has in store for me, and what he thinks i should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children i will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that god has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that god has blessed me with several things and i am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, i may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason god has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.

"well its sunday night and i'm just chilling in the room. i'm enjoying not having my roommate here. it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone. that's what my roommate does. instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day. i guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever. as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever i want then we have no problems. last night was pretty fun. i went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience. i kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he wasn't that good of a dancer because he couldn't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways. the funnest was on friday when me and kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party. we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that i met at camp texas. he was a counselor that i had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever. i really didn't think anything of it at the time because i thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so i kind of kept my distance. i e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me. he did, which was good. i was hoping he would. i think i kind of like him but i have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so i'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it. and plus he is the guy and i grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so i'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started. maybe that's my problem. when i want something i tend to let it come to me and i just wait around till something happens. maybe i should go after the things i want. speaking of things that i want, i applied to be a texas lasso. i got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview. i was so excited. i have wanted to join something like this ever since i got to campus. they do everything, from socials to community service. i heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past friday. he is an iron spike and he suggested i look into it because he thought i would enjoy it. and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe i could be able to hang out with joe a little more but whatever about that. i really hope i get in to this because i really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that i can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that. i have been recently hanging out with kayla who is one of the girls i met at orientation. we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now. that's why i want to get involved in something of my own so i wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me. that's not what college is all about. its about having fun and enjoying yourself, not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate. she is trying to get involved though. she signed up for the rowing team so we'll see how that works out. it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat. i'm no one to judge. i have got the music on my computer going and the tv so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while i sit here and type for twenty minutes. i have like five minutes left so that's good because i'm kind of getting tired of typing. tomorrow me, kayla, and her roommate sheik are going shopping at barton creek mall! i am very excited about that because i love to shop and i want some big sunglasses. i have seen lots around campus and i want some of my own. i really don't want anything else but u never know once you get going. i'm a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because i will buy them and add to the collection in my room. its going to be fun whether i get stuff or not because i just love shopping in general that's why my major is retail merchandising. i will get to shop for a major company like mace's or nordstrom or even tiffany's. that is my dream. i want to have a base office in new york city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company. i want to eventually be head person because i don't like being under someone else's control. but i know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe i will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams. my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but i think not yet. i don't want to miss anything up here. it is so much fun at college!

"right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes. but i'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet. ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things i don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. i think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad i think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. he's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. i'm going to be so behind in economics. i tell you. i really like that class though. so anyways. i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. a very few. whatever. i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. i just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" i think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"". that is really very jr. high. i miss those days. i wonder how cindy is doing. ugh. i really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again. i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. damn that sounds really conceited. maybe i'm a little of that too. i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. it's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. within reason that is. so anyway. i am these things but i feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted. i know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. i am so proud of myself lately. i am being such a good girl. although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway. i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. i'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. i have been developing such good habits. i make my bed everyday, i wash my face twice a day, i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early. o shit. i just got a little flash of procrastination. that sneaky devil. no go away!!!. i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. i just don't have the time for that. i run every day . mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. damn that dinner. ugh. what else do i do. o yea. i didn't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too. i haven't been drinking. i haven't been too flakey. with the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. anyway we are good terms at the present. i'm being a pretty good daughter. i finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. i want to write about something cool. no luck. i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes. bad flutes in lol. i'm probably really bad by now. i wonder if there is practice rooms around. i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. i thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. and then i would act all shy and innocent. it's just how i act. natural reflex to wanted attention. sometimes i think i'm so stupid. and then they would flatter me and ask me out. and i would act like i wasn't really sure. i

"hi i'm ben. i've been looking forward to this assignment since i heard of it. how often do i get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. i apologize. i can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. i'm listening to emenem right now. i don't want to give the reader the impression that i'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and i can type fast to it. man i pity whoever has to read this. let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. i was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no i wasn't high). i mean think about it. i'd go into this more but i'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. i really like ut. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. i like austin. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in austin. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. i can't stand him. i brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that i'm using right now. i usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. i suppose i could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but i promised my roommates this would only take 20 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 9 minutes really flew by. i'm a japanese major. now if you were wondering "" wow i wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? "" you know. i feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am i thinking about now. i guess i'm thinking about the way i think, and i guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. i usually think in words. unless i'm inebriated then i think in pictures. i don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that i have a short attention span but i somehow pictured this differently. i thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now i've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. while i'm telling you what to do, you should vote for gore. aww here's something i can write about: politics. i hate and fear george bush. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of austin is quite the insult. his christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. i rue the day the christian right gain presidential power. i also am happy i worked ""rue"" into that last sentence. aww yeah. well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. i also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. i'm glad i didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. i will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. i promise you i'm not crazy. well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man.

" i just walked in my room from going out and it seems the ac is not working. the room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days. the smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as i look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor. two canvases lay on the stained carpet. the idea was to paint each one different, but to have the same motif. it was harder to come up with an idea than i thought it would be. that was a few hours ago, which was before i had a glass of the fratty punch. it's so silly, how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol. what are they trying to do to us? women are not primitive. we understand what they have in mind. see, if it was up to the guys, they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn. but it is the punch that us ladies enjoy, and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply. as i stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys' house, i suddenly asked myself a question. do these boys really want to talk to me? i wondered. and if they do. why? two things quickly were brought to my attention. one was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company, or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on, one which by the way took me 35 minutes to pick out. how ironic huh?! the other was the fact that if they didn't desire to converse with me, that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk, and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties. it was then that i realized that either way, they were talking to me, and i got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne, as well as to look into their dreamy eyes! those stupid frat boys. man are they dumb, but they sure are entertaining!!!

"although overall, i am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. i'm actually on my own. i can't believe it - for the first time, i won't have my parents to rely on everything for. i'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. and i think i'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. even though i've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. i don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. i still would've preferred going to the college i wanted to go to, columbia u. i guess i'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, i'll just have to accept it. right now it's late, almost midnight. i am tired and i have so much to say right now but i just can't get it all out. most of what i think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what i actually want to pursue in my education. do i really have the commitment to study medicine? what am i going to major in? i'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. a lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. right now my parents are preparing for their trip to india. they haven't been there in 2 years. i feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. somehow i feel my parents' families resent me because i was actually born in america. also, i don't really feel ""indian. "" i am american in the full sense of the word. that's been a huge conflict i've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. the indian community i have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which i dislike. so i find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. however, i find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because i act different. i don't always hang out with indian people. in fact, i rarely do. strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by me, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. i don't know why i can be so bitter about this subject. i guess i just resent the idea of the indian culture trying to shape my life. i am about me, not about being indian. ok now that i'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, i'm going to complain about something else. how about religion? i am very proud of the fact that i am a christian. however, my parents don't seem to believe i am religious because i do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. i am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. it's the same way with the indian church i used to go to. i left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. as long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. i couldn't stand it so i left for a better church. spiritually i am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. right now, my roommate is out partying and i'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, i don't really feel lonely. i actually like being by myself. with others sometimes i feel like i have to act like i'm someone else. alone, i can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but i feel like typing more. i wonder if people think i'm some kind of nerd or recluse. i hate when people assume that about me since i'm not a party person and i do well in school. i really am different from most people, and i like that about me. when i get married and have kids (if i even want to have kids), that's something important i want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. that's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and i don't care what other people think. maybe i'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think i have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. i really do have a lot of friends. basically i look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person i want to befriend. so as i'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, i have to express a couple feelings. i'm excited about my new beginning in life at ut. i'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. i know i am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, i think i must end this. ok no i wont, haha! i still have a little more to say. i am a night person. i don't know why. but i just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. i feel like i can do things i couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. i wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? i know i'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. i wonder how much less people think of me because i am fat. i am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- i'm not dieting because of what other people think. i know it's not healthy for me, and believe me, i intend to live a long healthy life, and i need to start. sometimes i feel i am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. i don't intend to be a statistic of the ""freshman 15. "" well, with all that said, i am ending this now.

"some of this indian music my roommate listens to is o. k. the american songs she listens to are cheesy ones from the 80s, except the u2 song she likes. i could see mike patton covering this song. it is good for a pop song and he could make it sound really good with his voice. but i guess he is discerning in choosing which songs to cover. kind of like a music snob. who knows. i wish there was someone here who would have went with me to see richard buckner tonight. i would have gone alone but i am kind of afraid i would be the youngest person there, and i wouldn't have fun and it would be a waste of $10. and a waste of time because i have to study more. i spent too much time studying for speech and not enough for some of my other classes, although over the weekend i will have lots of time to catch up on studying. unless my friends keep coming over. i wish next year my friends will move to austin and we could share a place or something. they have a lot more freedom than me, it is unfair. it was decided i would go to college before i was born. for some of them they knew they were never going to go. i think expanding your mind in college is good though, there is practically nothing else i could do at this age besides get a minimum wage job or try to become a manager at a grocery store or something. my managers at the grocery store were pretty young, i suspect some of them are saving to go to college or something because they are taking classes at the junior college. i guess i am very privileged to not have to worry about money for college. i still feel guilty spending any money that i haven't earned at a job. some of my friends who are not well off and are not going to college do not feel bad about asking their parents for money and not even have a job! this song is horrible. i wish i could be ruder and tell my roommate to stop talking and not play cheesy music. i hope she doesn't see this. i don't think i am well suited to be in the business school. i am taking a class which involves marketing yourself which for some reason is very depressing. do you really need to take a class on eye contact? i more admire people who have made their way in the businesses world accidentally. not like pumped out of a school. like david geffen. he almost failed high school i think. but somehow he is good at running music companies. kind of depressing like a kurt vonnegut book. marketing yourself is a very depressing concept to me. the teacher in that class is sickeningly sweet. kind of crazy but i think i can tell that i am not suited to be a business person because i think my class where i have to learn how long to hold a gaze is creepy. i don't want to be taught how to suck up to corporate business people! i do not care about money very much, just as long as i don't have debts. i would live very simply in order to just not have debts. i would feel very bad if i did not pay my parents back by raising me. i don't want to buy a bmw. i wish i had more guts to find something else to do. why haven't i made any friends from my dorm? it is hard to find the kind of people i like to hang out with, laid back, good taste in art, and what else? it took me a long time to find some good friends in kingwood. i really should make friends instead of waiting for them to make me. story of my life. please please stop saying your homework out loud i'm going crazy. you better go home this weekend, roommate.

"three weeks ago i started out on an unforgettable journey through college. although i have been preparing myself for this journey for what feels like forever, i don't think that one could ever be completely prepared for the adventures that lie waiting for them at the university of texas. my school year started with a hectic and stressful week many people affectionately call rush. the name ""rush"" cannot even begin to describe the event that should be called ""stampede"". i can only imagine what hundreds of girls running around the ut campus in nice dresses and make up in the heat of august would look like to an innocent bystander that just happened to be on campus that day. with all of that over and behind me i thought that i could calm down for the start of school and get ready for the classes that were ahead of me. boy was i wrong. i don't think that i have had time to sit down long enough to think since i have been here. my classes move so fast and the stress of walking from class to class without getting run over or getting lost is enough to make anyone go crazy. but, with every 15second brake that i get i have to sit back and enjoy the college experience that i am having. sure i am busy, but the main reason i came to u. t. was to get out of my boring hometown and in to the always out of control city i now call home. i love it here and i can't imagine looking back on my college years with memories coming from any other place but austin.

first a bit of background last friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice i guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened i guess i am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now i'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid i wonder why i mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so really i just kid of went on with my life so i'm not dwelling on the crash what i am dwelling on is the fact that i was over the crash in a meter of minutes this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine i'm not more or less kind i don't enjoy life more i even had fun that weekend i don't feel that i am truly any closer to god i am not praying any more not that that is how i judge my relationship with god but even how i judge my relationship a no closer weird i should have done this later on i think better at night but if i wrote what i was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper i would lose these thought so i guess it is better this way i can always rewrite what i type onto paper but then i would feel the urge to revise and i haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet i mean what is what i truly think and feel what is spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what i can put together over time so i haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what i write neater or type it i guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as i think why i write on paper what i this but then even i can't read what i write half the time on a more petty note i am worried about math i just have no idea what to expect but that is something that i can put to the back o my mind i'm trying not to think of anything school related because i want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok i'm worried about math because i don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests oh well ,1,"[-0.318865, 0.198347, -0.272869, -0.318187, -0.701583, -0.125061, -0.443613, -0.083583, -0.736625, -0.488206, 8.111509, -0.590446, -0.322095, 0.76308, -0.897183, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.580847, -0.005358, 0.391899, 0.099882, 0.122833, -1.219165, 1.319724, 0.044649, 0.421926, 0.832877, 0.495993, -0.692164, -1.231555, -0.662832, -1.430891, 0.352564, 1.163658, -0.666166, -0.642023, 1.954591, 0.546557, 0.270343, 0.605344, -1.038726, 0.808985, -0.238266, -1.684065, -1.029782, -1.542652, 0.045975, -1.525718, -1.550129, -0.990827, -0.40749, -0.205578, -0.201852, -0.903715, -0.908721, 2.582212, 5.926392, -0.954251, -0.915247, 0.529872, -0.58571, 2.151926, 1.198478, -0.236024, -0.040389, -0.280398, -0.086094, -2.387564, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.070263, -0.422267, -0.235182, -0.451544, -0.408772, -2.416536, 4.530745, 3.813243, 4.681718, 4.111958, 4.838853]"
"i wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 69 degrees in my room. i had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and i'm generally a hot natured person. the thought of winter coming makes me really excited. i like summer, but it just stays too hot. maybe i should have gone to college in colorado or somewhere a lot cooler. i don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. i'm just always hot. i get it from my dad, he is the same way. we are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. joseph was another person i could do that with, but i never see him anymore. he should come down and visit, i know he likes it in austin. i am surprised that i am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. i don't even live in the same town anymore, i'm 3 and a half hours away, why does it matter. maybe if i had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, i wouldn't care as much. so far, i have been really disappointed with the college parties i have been to. they are nothing like the ones on tv, which i know tv isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). i almost wish i hadn't brought my tv, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. i need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. i would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so i might as well make myself as popular as possible here. the more people you know the better off you are. if that's true, i'm in trouble. the friends that i had down here before i moved are still my friends, but i want to find my own group. i feel welcome among my other friends, but i don't feel at home. i have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. the fig is stupid. when i signed up for it, the only reason i did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. there is one girl in there i'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. i tell myself i'm going to talk to people when i sit next to them in class, but every time i end up convincing myself not to. in my hometown of boyd, tx, there were about 350 students in my high school, so i knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. now i'm going to a school of over 50,000 students. no one would even know if i didn't show up for a month. in boyd, i'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. i sometimes just watch the clock when i'm bored, like in church. this weekend will be the best one so far. i am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. plus, i want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that i find attractive. i'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. dress to impress. i never go out looking worse than i want people to see me as. it's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. i am nothing special here. there is nothing that i can do, or that i know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. that has been a really humbling experience.

"" i think i deserve to, too, since i don't drink, smoke, or do anything like that. i don't know how my parents are going to feel about it. obviously, they're not going to be happy. but i don't think they can get too upset. like i said, i stay away from all the alcohol and stuff like that that is rampant in college, so hopefully they'll allow me this one thing. i think i've been a pretty decent kid. i've also been taking care of my lip so it doesn't get infected so they shouldn't have to worry about it. plus, my brother got a tattoo his first semester up here and i think that's more dangerous, especially since he got it on his spine. one thing that has me really nervous was caused by my own stupidity. i was over at my friend's house last night and he'd bought a doityourself haircut kit. me, wanting to save a few bucks, gave it a shot on myself. well, to trim my sideburns, i took off the clipper thing and just left the razor which is about a ""0. "" anyway, i go to the other room to ask my friend how it's looking. he says it's all right but needs a little work. so i go back to the sink, pick up the clipper and proceed to run it up the back of my head. immediately, from the sound, i could tell that i'd forgotten to put the #2 clipper on; it was still on ""0. "" now, i've got a bald spot on the back of my head. i really started freaking out. people would think i was a freak. i wasn't going to shave my head, but i had my friend fix it up as beast he could but it's still pretty obvious. now, i've got to wear a hat backwards for at least a week so no one will notice. i'm pretty selfconscious. if i thing there's something wrong with my looks, it becomes pretty hard for me to talk to people i don't know. which sucks since i'm already pretty shy and since i'm still trying to meet new people. it looks like the twenty minutes are up now. i hope i did this assignment right.

" i guess i will talk about the guy i was dating before i came here, since i just got off the phone with him before i got on the computer to complete this assignment. after dating him for two months i realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. there are no straight rules to follow. everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. at first i was so confused by this guy because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. after just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. i think that is weird. i guess i will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. i still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but i am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. i had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. i was thinking i could never do that. i think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. because i believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and i are not together. i thinki'm still new to the dating thing because i don't understand it. i try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. i have mostly dated older people. my first real boyfriend was seven years older than i. that relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than i was. his majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. i think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. after breaking up with him i felt i needed a boyfriend and i even felt a little lonely. now i am fine and mostly dated for fun i guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. i gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others i find attractive or of high standing and what i don't want my future husband to have one day. not to say i am definitly marrying someone but i hope i will find that right someone. for right now though i am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before i ever get married i want to have finished school for my own personal goal. you can't always rely on others in life so if i get a good education i can get a good job to support myself. this has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. because that someone else might not always be there. this has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. i hope i fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what i was thinking about. i feel confused by relationships and i guess i should be and i am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. i just hope everything will work in the long run and so i'll try not to worry about because i used to worry about things to much that i would stress my self out.

"everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. even though i am polite and nice. i consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. so i don't see what the problem is. so far, the first 2 1'2 weeks of school, i have not yet to meet a nice girl. i don't know what's wrong. it is sort of making me depressed. during orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. so far, i still hang around my friends that i had during high school. i want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. i hope the meetings at fsa and vsa will aide me in meeting new people. the parties here are pretty cool though. i just wish they played different music. my neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. the girls on my floor are also hard to approach. i don't know if it's me. maybe i'm thinking too much. the time i spend here seems to go by so fast. i get homesick quite often. i want to go back to houston. maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. i haven't been spending quite as much money as i planned to spend. so far i have spent probably around 30 bucks a week. which is average i guess. my classes so far has been good. i just hate oversleeping. right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. college is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me.

"hello, my name is jason. i felt like i needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and i am not familiar with that person. anyhow, lets talk about some stuff. hmm, where should i begin? i was born in alice. if your thinking this is like a biography, then i think that you will be wrong. however, back to what i was saying. i don't really like traveling to alice, tx. i find it kind of boring because i don't have anyone over there that is my age. all of my relatives are much older than i. these people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. lets talk about my uncle for instance. i will not mention his name, however, he was. i mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. why would i be interested in going and visiting him unless i wanted some crack or something? he is a liar anyways, and i don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. speaking of the kind of people i affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, i think that i accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. however, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, i think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. anyways, i'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. lets talk about my big brother. now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. this is the reason that i look up to him. he knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all a's! i have to admit that i am somewhat jealous. however, he does help me out and gives really great advice. when he tutors me, i feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how i retain material. he is two years older than me, but i am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that i feel is so precious to a person. i hated not being respected. it made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and i couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. however, i put an end to all that crap when i joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. i learned how to fight the hard way though. my coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so i just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. i adopted a slugger's style of fighting. the reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. my strength began to get developed when i began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. that year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so i took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. from then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. i didn't even have to fight anymore! but i kept on because i got too competitive and i kind of liked it. currently, i'm undefeated in my hometown. however, i was just an average fighter when it came to the golden gloves. i stopped when i started college. that's enough of that. my father is the next person i want to discuss. he has worked his way from rock bottom, and i admire that. he slept in a car for 6 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called southern pacific). he helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). i still love her and all, i just don't agree with anything she does. she seems to have tunnel vision, u know what i mean? let me explain because my time here is almost up. she is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. today she seems more like a stranger, cause i don't see her all that much. she didn't invite me to her wedding. my time is up. talk to u later. bye ",1,"[0.550944, 0.092728, -0.311216, 0.16128, -0.069755, -0.794736, 0.824015, 0.91211, 1.11123, 0.753815, -0.154424, 0.126864, -0.242931, 0.38235, 0.951803, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.00414, 0.097289, 0.129807, 0.137604, -0.382778, 1.997701, -0.658316, -0.20717, 0.056531, 0.437746, -0.440101, -0.107483, -0.873872, -0.009494, -1.164566, 0.814656, -0.906028, 3.149038, -0.818, -0.853062, 1.962381, -0.083878, -1.46311, -0.597723, -0.35628, 0.59221, 0.510574, 0.314967, 1.130607, -0.383122, 2.240061, 3.350308, 1.624074, 1.191064, 0.047726, 0.271722, -1.187078, -0.384218, 0.323189, 0.803728, 0.0317, 0.363829, 0.836838, -1.095683, -0.430577, -0.480161, 0.207094, 0.716079, 0.727924, -0.086094, -0.215479, 0.761451, -0.073676, -0.23436, 0.034167, -0.081487, -0.337085, -0.422267, -0.432135, 2.375545, 0.42643, 0.058924, 4.755241, 3.895505, 4.16236, 4.548415, 4.960577]"

"i went to my sorority's crush party last night. i didn't really know what to expect because they had it at buffalo club and i don't dance, i don't smoke, and i certainly don't look 21. at any rate, i wasn't having very much fun after 30 minutes. at that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, i figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so i said yes. we ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. we exchanged phone numbers and i kind of figured that was the end of it. it was about twelve-thirty when i drank half of my ""big sister's"" long island iced tea and i have to say i think that it really impaired my judgement. i got talked into going to dance across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. i had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy i'm particularly attracted to. for some reason i put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him french kiss me after having met him only four hours before. i feel really cheap now, i never do things like that. i don't really know what the reason for my actions was (i'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). maybe i'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since i've had a boyfriend. the problem is that i woke up this morning and regretted last night. i feel like i used this guy, i didn't mean to. maybe it's not that i don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that i don't want him as a boyfriend. the worst thing about this is that i've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and i think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else.

"well i'm supposed to write and i don't really know what to say. i'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch tv. i wasn't doing anything productive so i thought i'd get this writing assignment out of the way. do typos matter? because i keep erasing, but i don't think it really matters. ok i left one in. so it's really hot in here. and my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. but oh well. i'm waiting for the cartoon home movies, to come on. i don't usually watch cartoons, but i saw this one once and it's really funny and i liked it a lot. wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. i think i'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. i'm so sick of studying. my roommate is talking about a little girl in a missy elliot video. what song is this? i have no idea. i'm hungry, but i can't eat and type at the same time. my side itches. hold on a second. aw there we go. much better. so i don't understand why i have so much work to do in my english class. it's ridiculous! it's making me so frustrated. my other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! i have to read 22 chapters in jane eyre by tuesday. oh i like this song. probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because i'm trying to type, but it's ok. i seem to be doing ok with it on so far. i'm really tired and i wish i could just go to sleep but i need to study some more before i do. i have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. wow, i complain a lot. i don't mean to, but i do. ok. running out of things to say. talk about smells. can't smell much. it's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. damn! only 8 minutes have passed! twenty minutes feels like forever. we did a stream of consciousness paper in creative writing in high school and i remember how much my hand hurt while i was doing it. i need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. and from driving from college station (no i wasn't at a&m) to san antonio and then to austin today. that could do it to you! well i want a pretzel. they're sitting right next to me but i can't get them. when is this thing going to over with? i wonder what you learn from this? how weird and random people are? i think i'm a pretty random person. i used to say that word a lot in middle school. i hated middle school so much. i don't know why. it was just horrible for the most part. and high school wasn't much better. i like college a lot more than both already. well my show should be coming on soon. i can't wait to watch it. i hope it's a funny episode! i always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's not funny and think i'm stupid. not that i care, but i want people to know that it's a really funny show. i need to be studying for english. no, not english, music. english just popped into my head. hmm. ok only 6 more minutes. i think i can handle this. wow, it got quiet in here. and really really hot too! at first our a'c was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. and now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. katie just discovered longhorn delivery. i love that thing! i used to use it all the time when i used to come visit friends in austin. we were all pretty lazy. i'm becoming less lazy here i think. i have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. i want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. i'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since i left. my parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. i think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. i hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. i've been warned it's almost 11:30 and home movies will be on shortly! i'm excited. i think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! well my time is almost up and i'm glad. oops, i hit the caps lock for a little bit. ok 10 seconds. and i'm done!

"well, all that is on my mind sure cannot be summed up in twenty minutes, but i will continually type for that time. lately i have desired to do nothing but become closer to god. he is awesome. my freshman year of high school was great all because i had god on my side. now i feel like i have lost him. i know he is still there for me, but i have damaged that relationship that we had. i chose to live my life and not listen to him. it hurts because life was stressfree and i always knew that god was just right there waiting for me everywhere i went. when i would walk outside i would smile and greet god with open arms. now i feel like sometimes i look negatively upon the weather and don't even think of the great god who made everything. i have been trying to become closer to god. i read in the bible more often. rather than praying for myself or for god to do great works in my life, i now ask god what i can do to better the lives of others. i think that my outlook on life will change once i fully begin to ask him what he wants of me rather than demanding him to help me. i think once my relationship with him improves, my money worries will go away. one worry is about transferring out of the school of business. i could transfer out of the business school, but i am afraid of what my future holds. i know with a business degree at ut jobs will be flying at me from every direction. instead of being a cutthroat businesswoman, i want to help society. if i would get paid a good amount, i would definitely help the homeless or disabled. that attitude is wrong. god does not want me to think like that. he wants me to trust that he will provide all my financial necessities. he wants me to pray to him to find out what i need to do in life. he will give me meaning once i am fully ready to accept his answer. i continually pray to god asking him what i am to do with my life. he has not told me. i do not think it is that he has not told me; i think he has told me to wait for the right time for him to tell me. i know he will let me know when he feels i am ready to accept the task he has prepared for me. right now i long to know what that task is. as i read the bible daily and pray to him daily, i feel i am taking one step closer to receiving a better understanding of my life and knowing what i am destined to do. i cannot wait until god shows me the way to my career, my husband, my kids, my destiny, but i always have to remember what my mom says. god and her both agree: patience is a virtue and in order to obtain these goals, i need to be patient.

"right now, my dad just left and i am feeling homesick and sad. even though by the time i left home i was so ready to leave, but now seeing him makes me feel really sad. it's not just that i feel sad but i feel guilty to. my dad is so awesome and when i lived at home i never really appreciated him. sometimes i can be so incredibly selfish and self absorbed. i guess experiences like leaving home are good for us because they help open our eyes and let us see things that we wouldn't ordinarily. at home i was in my own little world which revolved around my school, friends, and family. now being in austin with out any of these comforts, i feel much more vulnerable and also naive. living on the drag can open your eyes more than anything. my dad told me that just yesterday the bank underneath my building got robbed. that kind of stuff freaks me out because i go to that bank constantly and i just never expect anything like that to happen. i really don't understand why people do things like robbing a bank. i guess it's just hard for me to understand how people could feel like they have no other options than to just rob a bank. although it's probably naive of me to say this, there are so many organizations and programs out there for people which just go so unutilized. i really enjoy working a places like those. i am still consider pledging the apo frat. the only problem is that if i do it's still going to cost me money, even though it's not as much as normal frats. i'm really not sure i can afford that. i spend money so fast up here. i probably need to get a job, but i really don't want to. i think it would be so overwhelming if i was to get a job. it would be a fun way to meet people though. and my managers said that they would be more than willing to get me a job at any of the austin macaroni grill's if i wanted one. i really miss all of my friends from my job. next time i go home i am going to go up there and visit everybody. i am going to visit all of my friends also. i miss them all so much. last night i called mandy. it was so good to talk to her again. she is honestly the only person who really understands me. she understands all of this crap that i am going through with charles. i can not believe that i have been here for 2 weeks and he hasn't called me once. i have no idea what the deal is with him, but if he doesn't want to se me any more then he needs to let me know. well, time's up.

"my roommate has a poster of a wolf beside the computer. it looks like an alaskan husky my aunt has. i saw a wolf once and a coyote ran across the road in front of me while i was driving. my friend brandon was with me and said did you see that as if i didn't see a big coyote run in front of my car . brandon is not very bright but i feel sorry for him because he doesn't have many friends. we worked together one summer on a farm and he didn't work very hard and that makes me mad because i had to do most of the work. i just sneezed and every time i sneeze i do it more than once my mother is the same way she sneezes three or four times in a row . i am sure she misses me a lot right now . i can't believe she cried when i left to move to college. that embarrasses me but at least she cares about me. she has more respect for me than my older brother and that makes me mad because i love my brother and he is a good person but since he went of to college and messed up a little she has in her on way shunned him. and now my family looks at me like i am the good child. i am not good but they think i am. whenever i got my first job my parents thought i was so responsible . i hated that job. i hate heb to this day . all the people who worked there made me feel like a snob because i was actually going to go to college one day instead of working at heb for 30 years . why am i still upset about a job i quit 2 years ago . that's like amanda baize cheated on me in the 8th grade and i will never forgive her . it hurt so bad . i mean, i have had a different girlfriend who i love very much for the last three years but i still hate amanda baize. misti davidson was her best friend and used to be mine but she stopped talking to me because she felt she was too good to talk to me . people would think i am crazy for saying that but that is the truth. now i am feeling guilty for just complaining about stuff in a homework paper to people who don't even know me and now i feel like when anyone reads this paper they will think that i am a guy with a lot of problems. i am actually a very stable person all my friends come to me for help because i give good advice. i really hope someone can read this paper because i am trying to be honest and type everything i am thinking while i am thinking it but it doesn't always come out in readable text . i am worried about this class because pennebaker said that students who took some psychology in high school do worse in his class than others . i don't think i am the kind of person to rest on my laurels but maybe i am deluding myself . one thing that bothers me is whenever i think i am not being honest to myself. does that make sense ? now i feel like i am talking to a psychologist and he is analyzing all that i say and i feel really foolish . how stable am i really? i don't care. i like my life and anyone who says that i have problems can kiss my butt because they have problems of their own. we all have problems but that doesn't keep most of us from functioning. i got a feeling i won't do very good on this paper and i guess i am feeling ""anxiety"" but i have been typing for well over 20 minutes and i have shared much more than i really wanted to, to people who don't really care and frankly i am tired. one of my many faults is that i am too trusting and any time i talk to anyone i reveal too much . thank you for your time . sorry for this mess (my life or paper, take it either way) hasta luego ",1,"[-0.330183, 1.02348, 1.254889, 0.88494, 0.879456, 0.830945, -0.633516, -0.577315, -0.604295, 0.216111, -0.089113, 0.145257, -0.47243, 1.00769, -0.490793, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.175548, 1.225949, -0.132181, 1.257876, -0.097918, 0.741101, -0.89883, -0.624052, -0.211099, -0.887969, 0.448605, 1.342185, 0.69229, 0.854568, 0.160123, 1.219339, 0.250185, 0.81629, -0.065106, -0.550924, 0.843849, 0.251244, -0.783948, 0.541989, -1.166846, 0.656255, 1.577797, 0.654774, 0.668562, 1.735632, 1.451257, 0.970938, 0.731809, 0.752388, -0.388564, 0.92821, 0.268058, -0.914151, -1.197804, -0.125085, -0.954251, 0.108661, 0.540327, -0.12427, 0.635662, -0.480161, 0.771853, -0.169606, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.657444, -1.164039, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.096462, -0.37208, -0.337085, 0.223927, -0.849983, 0.392899, 0.339644, -1.292689, 5.405912, 4.531845, 4.677591, 4.784664, 4.186754]"
"today is labor day. this weekend i went to my family reunion in noccona, tx. my cousin, tracey, is recently engaged. i am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, i am a little bit jealous. i know i am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. my brother has been married a little more than four years. when he first married, i did not think too much about it. now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. my parents have been married 31 years! i cannot believe it. in today's world where divorce is a commonplace, i am proud of my parents for sticking together. my parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a yorkie. her name is brittnay, and i love her with all of my heart. i was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. i think i miss her more than anyone else, probably because i get to talk to other people on the phone. brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and i cannot wait until i see her again. college life is so much different than high school. i t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. i really do not feel older. for some reason, i always feel young. when i think about all the petty gossipy things i worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. once people enter college they change so much. for instance, i have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. however, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. i am really concerned about my grades. i really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. i want to be a child psychologist. psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. i love children, and i also love helping people. i figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. when i become a mom, i want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. this way, i can spend lots of time with my own children. i also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. if i worked all day, i do not think i would have time. this summer i started cooking, and i found that it is quite enjoyable. it is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. i would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. i also need to find a job. i did not realize how much money college consumes. i feel bad asking my parents for money. plus, i worked at the pottery, a local shop in midland, for a little more than a year, so i am not used to needing money from my parents. my mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. i love my parents'family very dearly. they are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that i have ever known. my family is also very generous. i just hope that i will turn out to be the kind of people they are.

"i am very tired bc i have been studying all day for various classes. i know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. this semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. i can't believe that i am having to take these evening classes i much rather have my 8:00 classes so that i could go to work and make some money now i don't what i am going to do. i guess become a male escort ha ha. i guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. alsoo on my mind is the fact that i am kind of seeing 2 girls. i find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now i am broke all i have to offer is my heart. i don't know bc about 2 weeks ago i was pretty much dateless and desperate and now i am seeing these two girls and i have two others wanting to go out sometime. this sucks because they are all great girls and i don't want to hurt either of them. but i can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. it always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when i start dating somebody seriously i suddenly become attractive again. i am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. man once again this sucks!!! what else am i thinking about graduating. i am tired of the school life i want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. then again what am i talking about i am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks i get. if i didn't have conscience i would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. no money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. why can't my parents be rich. i wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. i just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am i going to pay the bills. and day in and day out i see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. but do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted? one can only wonder but i would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. but i guess like my dad said ""son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. "" hes not a educated man by any means but i believe he is right on this matter. for that reason i keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. now that i have rambled on for 20 minutes i am signing off.

"this is the first time i have come to the library and when i first arrived here, i had no idea how to use the computers. first you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. i wonder what the point of this assignment is. i think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. how much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? people who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. another feeling i have is that of being worried because i am doing this assignment at the last moment. after finishing it, i hope that i will get to class on time but i should because i still have a couple of hours before class starts. i am not sure what to write now. i have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so i am not going to write them down. i need to start getting to my morning class on time. i've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material i have learned before but i do still need a review so i have to start trying to get there on time. it's strange typing this assignment because all through high school i always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. it feels like i am writing an e-mail to someone because i never worry about any english stuff on those. the only thing i am doing different is that i am capitalizing some of the words which i normally don't do when i write e-mails. i want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so i can move on to the next assignment. these type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. i like this class so far. i have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. two more minutes and that will be twenty. i can't wait to go back to houston to visit. i am partially homesick. there are certain things that i want to go back for and other things that i am glad that i left behind.

"first, it took me a long time to get through the austin traffic. then, when i got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, i still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with justin, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and kevin messed around, but she lied. i can't believe that she did that. then i told her about the fact that i had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. i still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on friday night, she told me that she had liked justin, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as i had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called justin to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. i agreed, i don't know why, but i did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. i didn't know how to handle it, so i freaked, i just started yelling at her. i don't know why, i should have been more calm , but i just couldn't do it. i tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. i still can't believe how mean i was. and then, on saturday morning, i called her, because i thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then i freaked again. i started yelling at her. i was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. i couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s i called justin, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my mcdonalds lunch. i had lost my appetite. i was miserable. kenny could see that. i got to a&m, but i had no desire to party, all i wanted to do was talk to jenny so that i could apologize to her for what i said. i ate like half my dinner. it was good but i just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and i was miserable, people were drinking and all i wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, kenny gave me the number to amy's cell phone. so i called it, and amy wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then kristen answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then james, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. i was really hurt. so i got her brothers number from justin. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her cell phone number to kenny, and her brother's number to justin. that devastated me. i just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then justin called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. i was crushed again. the one thing that i loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. i have never felt so bad. i wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but i couldn't do that, i had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, i was not happy at all. finally, at 1230 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck amy, i hate that bitch. i have never liked her. i just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. i don't care if she hates me, i hate her. i feel bad that cristin hates me. i like her. i really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. i don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home i got a speeding ticket. oh after i talked to jenny, i got a half-as hug, and then she hugged justin and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. i was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 70 in a 30. i'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. i wanted to call her so bad, but i couldn't, i wanted to so bad, not even funny. on monday, i talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. i liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 7. it woke me up. i love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. i really want to talk to her, so i hope that she calls me tonight. i stayed up to 3 waiting for her last night, then i fell asleep. tonight, i wont make that same choice. i'm going to go to bed early tonight.

"well my experience so far up in this large city has been one i won't forget. i've several new people but most of the people i am with are the one's that i have known all my life. it's amazing how much you can share with your roomate although i've known her all my life. i just feel bummed cause i'm so far from home i miss my parents and most of my family. and of course there are boy problems too. john who i have liked forever doesn't even give me the time of day. which totally bites. i just wish he would notice me and then there is my kind of boyfriend back home whom i need to let go but right now he is the only thing that is holding me up from completely losing it. it's scary up here. and being mexican really doesn't help either. i feel like an ugly duckling up here. i feel that people are looking at me different because i don't look like them. or maybe i'm just very parnoid about meeting new people. it's funny though, i have been waiting for this experience for most of my teenage years and now that it is here i just want to go home to the normal for me at least. it is just so frustrating when your sitting in a classroom of more than 600 people and you have no one to talk to. i know i should start meeting new people and all but it's just very scary for me and i don't even know why. i evy alot of people up here. i evy those that can just sit next to a person and be like hey my name is becky or whatever. that just one of my many problems. i know they are stupid but they really freak me out when i start to think about them. so most of the time i try to stay away from things like this that will make me think of all that is confusing in my life. what i do not know is if i can live here in austin and go to school here for 5 years. when i came to orientation at the business college they had posted in big letters welcome class of 2007 me and my roomate were like what we have to be here 5 years that is crazy. everyone that i left behind back home all told me that these were going to be the best years of my life. and that i was going to meet my life long friends. so far i truly believe that all of us from san benito will remain friends the rest of our lives. i guess you could say that we are each others shoulder to lean. we always go out together, eat together, and just hang out together. i know it is against school policy and all but before school started we had a big sleep over and everyone just hung and enjoyed each others company. i liked that alot. i think it brought us closer and we learned to appreciate that connection we had with one another. i just know they will be there when i break down and cry about everything that i have been building up inside my head. thank god i knew my roommate because my other girlfriend is having some difficulty with her roommate and i'm just fortunate not to have that problem. it's like diana and me our soulmates we just didn't realize it til now. it's funny cause we share the same thoughts about most stuff. and we even spend countless hours talking about boys and other things bothering us, but it is mostly boys! i love her a great deal and i am extremly grateful for her. i also have a friend back home who i used to work with and he is great too. he calls me and leaves me inspirational messages on my phone which always brings a smile to my face when i'm struggling to get to class in the blazing hot sun. but god blessed me with really great friends.

"i tried three times to get this web site and it kept bringing up that the server was down. i am the mother of a 10 month old and when he goes to bed, that is the time i need to get busy and do my work. i often stay up until 2 or 3 am trying to get everything done that i need to get done. i have the king and i on the tv, i am looking very much forward to going to the bass concert' performing arts center to see it. i bought three tickets. my husband and i are going and taking my grandmother for her 75th birthday. it should be a real treat. the house is quiet except the tv (on low) and the dishwasher. i love the sound of the dishwasher. it is a night time sound for me because when i was growing up my mother would turn it on after the news on her way to bed. it is a comforting sound. it was a normal bedtime noise then, now 20 years ago, and now in my own home i enjoy the sound. i would miss it if we were to get one of those new expensive machines that didn't have the same rolling and tumbling sounds. i love water, the ocean, it kind of reminds me of that, but in thinking about it also probably sounds like being in utero. this musical is so beautiful, i just love the musicals of the past, a time long gone except you can visit through videos, theatre in your mind. its sort of and escape from daily hectic real life schedules. speaking of hectic every day schedules, my car is in the shop. it was there today since 9am and at 445pm i hadn't received a call about it yet. i don't think they are very considerate, i had to call, and if i hadn't would they have closed up and gone home without saying a ***** word to me! probably. in order for me to be in class at noon tomorrow, i need to have nicholas at the daycare by 11am . and i have to have a way to get the car. freddie works night at the post office and he needs to go to bed when he gets home, not fool around waiting to take me down to the honda service dept. being without your car is a big pain in the butt. it is the air-conditioning , door locks, and electric window. of course, it is the drivers window that is messed up, and when you unlock the door with the key, it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't lock and unlock the real drivers door. and usually it is when i have my arms full of stuff, the baby, and when i am in a hurry. as soon as i am finished, here in a matter of minutes, i can go read the mountain of books i had to get this semester. man, this assignment is making me sweat. when i complain about things i often feel bad, because i know there are people who have it worse than i do. we watched titanic . broken up in three evenings, it was good, but it made me cry. what a way to die. or lose your family or loved ones. life is the sweet with the tart. i guess. i am curious what will be achieved from your collection of these stream of consciousness writings. i have more than satisfied the 20 minute requirement now, i would like to print this as a receipt, but guess what? my ink cartridge is out, and it was for the survey too, so i hope i can pull it up again and print it when i get out to buy one, i tried at target last week, but of course, they were out !!! the story of my life.

""the artist"" for most part are really down to earth and i look forward to every dance there is. its been two weeks since school started, yet our room still stinks!!!!!! we cannot take the smell out. being in the ninth floor. we cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of nowhere land stuck in a corner were no body comes an visit us. that's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. its sunny outside its not hot like it usually is. i love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. that little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. i love that smell of wet grass as well. ummmmmmmmmmmm. so one did popcorn and i smell it all the way over here. 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry i got distracted by the timer less then am done. it been distracting since it started ",0,"[-0.578704, -0.271619, -1.138156, 0.369945, -0.270646, 0.410389, -0.040154, -0.184085, -0.640483, -0.086821, -0.215069, -0.590446, 1.129669, -1.208105, -0.129542, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.297881, -1.015325, 1.191445, -0.7504, -0.742368, -0.536374, 2.125567, -0.624052, 0.049737, -0.151886, 1.127599, -0.227664, 0.50187, 1.82745, -1.073465, -0.861264, -0.473116, -0.429288, -0.327368, -2.012082, 0.132552, -1.73761, -1.35728, -1.038726, -1.885274, 0.227538, -0.401915, -0.760611, 0.113203, -0.775702, -0.345333, -0.027706, -0.463699, -0.822954, -1.572231, 1.41101, -0.853352, -1.479662, 0.509281, -1.001272, 0.368959, 1.188077, -0.104775, 0.552759, -0.030512, -0.480161, 2.662912, -0.546834, 1.072835, -0.086094, 0.743447, -0.613718, -0.073676, 1.497076, -0.607823, 1.382891, -0.337085, 2.118201, -1.396907, 2.394059, 0.151675, 0.13658, 4.408096, 4.223626, 4.33755, 4.574206, 5.315448]"
"as i write this paper i am still filled with the stress, but know gets much worse. i have been hired for a job, and i am still pondering if it is possible to handle both a job and school. i guess you can call it greed about money, but i need it to stay here. i am also thinking that this to easy. college is supposed to be hard, and yet my hardest class is my microeconomics. with all this stress i still have the one thought in my head. what if i was not born? would it be less stressful? this is not a suicide letter, but the thought of me not being born always enters my mind. is life nothing but work and school, or is it much more. i do not know i guess i am always thinking about the negative aspects of life. the world is not like peaches and cream. tonight is a busy night. i have to do my laundry, and do some reading. i guess i am psyching myself out. and yet i am alone in a city that is surrounded by my burden. i do not know what the point of writing this. i guess i need the grade, but even then i wish why i can not be truly happy about my life. to think that some where around the world somebody is happy, and it makes me sick to think about that. life is not fun and games it is a weary journey that must be gone through, but i can't rest my feet until i am done and gone.

"moving here to austin has had me thinking about all sorts of things, about my life in general. these past few weeks, i have been analyzing about every aspect of my life. i am constantly running countless memories of my life by home through my mind. as excited as i am to be here, and i much as i dislike the city i moved from, i cannot help but miss my friends and family and all that i left behind. i am not the most outgoing of people and i find it difficult to strike up conversations with random people, therefore prolonging any new friendships. i love this city, though and i am trying to come out of my shell and be the fun loving, loud girl i was back home. my friends and family back home reassure me it will only be a matter of time before i begin to feel right at home and have a whole new hoard of friends, but until then, i feel very lonely. my roommates on the other hand are worse off than me. the three of them are all friends of mine from back home. they all have boyfriends with who they are in constant contact with. they are eternally homesick and pretty much no fun whatsoever. i am a person who finds it difficult to hang around the house all day, but they on the other hand do not even want to go out to explore the city. so they are a big drag in my social life. hopefully by the end of the year, i will have gotten them to enjoy party life at least half as much as i do, that is if i can tear them away from their cell phones for more than five minutes. all this time at home has allowed me to build up a nice collection of songs from the internet, and enjoy all the benefits the internet has to offer. i have been able to chat with friends near and far in length without any phone charges, which is always nice. yes i am very happy to be here in austin, but i just want this transitional phase to fly by so i can feel right at home. i am not even so much homesick as i am just lonely. with my circle of friends limited i do not have much to do except things on my own. perhaps that is not such a bad thing, seeing as how i am doing some definite soul searching on my long lonely walks and my hours spent at bookstores, and libraries.

"austin is very different from my home town. i live in a small town about 60 miles south of houston called sweeny. it has only 3500 people in the whole town. everywhere you go you run into someone you know. austin is so big and when i meet people i wonder if i will ever see them again, but so far i have seen a lot of people i have met. i live in kinsolving and i have met a lot of girls in my dorm that are really nice. i like the ut campus too. it is not to spread out although i do have to walk a lot to get to my classes. that is ok because i can use the exercise. this psychology class and my chemistry class have over 500 people in it. that was very overwhelming for me but i have adjusted somewhat. today i was walking on the drag and saw so many people out and about for the game. it is the first game of the season and i'm very excited. there are so many people that used to go to school here or are just big longhorn fans. they are all dressed in orange and many have their kids with them and even the kids are dressed in orange and white. it is really neat to see so many supporters and fans of the school and the football team. i am really excited about the game. i hope we beat north carolina state. it seems so weird that i can consider myself as ""we"" or part of the ut traditon, atmospere, and college! i hear we have the number one recruiting team in the nation. that is cool because these are people the same age as me. i met one of the new recruits the other night. he was huge and i'm sure he plays on defense. he sure didn't look like a freshman!! as you can tell i like football. i think a lot of that has to do with the time of year. probably also because my dad was a high school football coach and i've grown up with it all my life. also i was a cheerleader in high school and i miss cheering a little, so i always look forward to a football game. that is probaly why i am so excited about the game today. it is amazing to me that so many other people feel the same way about football. i also am excited about the game because it will be fun to learn the ut traditons and meet new people. well my 20 minutes is up. i hope i wrote enough but i just don't type very fast so it takes me awhile to type out what is on my mind.

"about two weeks before i came to austin i was already feeling the affect of college changing my life. many of my friends left before i did and i said goodbye to all of them. i knew that it would be awhile before i saw any of them again. it feels really strange now that all the people that i have grown up with all my life are all going to new places. many of the people from my high school i may never see again. even though my high school was very large the faces i saw were familiar to me. now that i am at the university of texas many faces i have never come across before and that is a strange feeling. i kind of like having so many different people around. it just makes me feel better to know that i'm involved in such a large university. everyone that i do meet is very nice and i am making many new friends. my roommate and i are getting along very well and i am glad that i have him as a roommate. i have seen many people from my high school, but many of the upperclassmen i knew from my school live off campus so i might only run into them every once in awhile. it is strange that i don't have a ""bestfriend"" anymore because all of them are some other place. the people i hang with aren't as close to me as my old friends were. i guess that it has only been a couple of weeks so far and that is just how it will be until i live around here longer. i don't really wish that i had gone somewhere else, but i just get that home sick feeling a little. home sick doesn't mean that i miss my parents so much, but just that all the people i was familiar with are gone. i don't really miss my parents that much yet, but i'm sure that i will soon when i finally realize that i'm not living there anymore and the ut is my home now. i wish that i had a car so that i could go places around here. i'm stuck on campus pretty much all the time. almost everything that i need is here though so that is a good thing. i wish that i could have brought my turntables up to ut, but my parents didn't want me to yet. i hope that i can dj at some clubs when i get a little more experience. my older friend was kind of my mentor to becoming a dj and i'm hoping that he can give me the hook ups that i need to play at places. i don't like being alone in my room especially with the door shut it makes me feel closed off. if i'm here alone i will usually keep the door open so i can converse with the people outside. they have really good study rooms in the basement of my dorm and its really good to go down there and read or do homework. college so far has been pretty much what i expected it to be there hasn't been any real shockers yet. i only choose to come to ut my senior year. my parents both went to arkansas so i didn't really have a bias to any college. i visited a&m and ut as well as ou and some other colleges last year and that is when i made my decision to come here. i like the urban atmosphere that ut has as opposed to all the other colleges i visited. since the time is up i better go down to the basement to study or else i won't make it into the computer science major.

"i am at work right now. i guess i'm a little hesitant about writing this stream of consciousness, because we never do this in school. we're always asked to write on a specific topic or something of that sort, and to write what we think is such a broad topic. i'm sick, and i don't think its because of those freshman jitters you were talking about. i was completely confident in going to school. nonetheless, i got sick. . my parents say its because i don't have enough sleep or because the dorms have diseases. i don't live in the dorm, though, which is both a plus and a bad thing. i like living off campus, because it feels more homey and seems like there's a place to get away from school. then again, a lot of my friends live on campus so i don't necessarily get to hang out with them a lot. its ok though, because they always try to include me. yesterday, i studied at pcl until midnight and my friend was so worried about me walking home alone that she made these two guys walk home with us. i have bad congestion and my mind seems like its under a lot of pressure, so if i don't make sense, that is probably why. i'm listening to music which seems kind of girly and i feel that the guy i work with might think it is too, but he hasn't said anything. no matter what i do, i like to have music on. when i sleep, when i study. its a habit, i guess. the main thing i have on my mind is successively passing my classes. i have no doubt that i will pass. . but passing with a's is another thing. i am one of those girls who went through all 12 years of basic schooling with all a's, and have never had a problem with being behind in class or even worrying about getting a b. it might seem like the work of a perfectionist, but i wasn't always the most studious. i'm quite the procrastinator. ever since i started college, however, it seems like i've had quite an interest in my classes and studying. of course, there's the occasional partying, but it seems like college is an experience to do what you want to do. i like to study and learn and feel as if i've accomplished something on my own will. its like reading. when i was little, i used to read a lot! as school started, they always made us read books, so i lost interest in the joy of reading willingly. this past summer, i read uncle tom's cabin and it was wonderful. it was probably the first book i read on my own for awhile. when there's studying to do, and organizations to participate in, there's no time for leisure time like reading or watching tv. that is one thing i'm proud of since i've gotten here. i haven't watched much tv. i wish i was more of a news-person, but the news just doesn't catch my interest all that much. its like everyday there's another child missing or a new statistic that everyone is obese. i guess shows like dateline or 20'20 that show the in-depth look at stories are more my style. we were told a story in mythology about how people used to have four legs and four arms and two heads, and it was like they were connected by their backs. well, these 'people' became overly arrogant and so the gods decided to split the two in half so there would be more of them and they would be more efficient, and they wouldn't gloat so much. then they scattered the halves all around the world, and that is why we go around searching for our other half. i like this story so much because i'm a romantic. hopeless romantic is more the term i would use to describe myself. even though i've been wonderfully single for 18 years. . there's this hope that there will be a special someone i will have sparks with and this higher connection to. i don't know if i've watched too many movies or have too many daydreams, but i guess i'm like most girls searching for their prince charming. sometimes i look into the atrological signs, of which i am a virgo. it usually always says that virgos get bored quickly. i think that in a way, i am that way. its horrible to say, but i think i'll tire of someone quickly if they don't keep my interest. of course, i like to keep everyone as friends, but romantically speaking, there has to be something different about a person. there's a song by ashanti that goes, 'i want to be like those girls in the movies, have a guy fall hopelessly in love with me. ' now, that seems kind of selfish, but to know that a guy really cares about you and would sacrifice many things for you is a really different characteristic. guys nowadays are so un-chivalrous. i feel like a little boy-crazy girl right now, but my friend had mentioned that i should talk about this in my writing and i guess it kind of stuck. fortunately, i'm completely content with my life and i feel that i have a lot going for me. i am not at all ashamed of being single, but there's always those people who ask why there's no guy in my life. what do i say to them? i love being single. there's those girls who go blind by love, and i hope to never lose myself in the process of loving someone else. its crazy.

"i am bored, i don't know what to write. i think that i am going to enjoy college. i miss my friends and family from back home, but i am starting to mak new friends here. i will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. if i do go, i want to make sure that i will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that i went i didn't really get mush time to sleep, so i was pretty tired on my way back. i have been tired all week long now. i went to bed after midnight last night and then i had to get up this morning at five so that i could go do the pt test for the airforc rotc. we didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. i wish that we could have worked out too. i really hate it while i am doing it, but afterwards i feel pretty good. tuesday, when i got done with my pt test, i started throwing up on the field. i was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when i had to start the two mile run. my time for the run went up a minute. i will try to get that back down. i want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. i want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. but i care more about those than the run. i need to make up an excercise schedule for the rotc. i don't really know when i want to do everything. i will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. since i have to wake up at five on tuesdays and thursdays, i usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. i will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, i will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. that should be plenty of excercise. i will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. i wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but i barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. i think that i will like it in the air force. it doesn't look like i had thought that it would be. they were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on tv. it looks a little more respectable that the army. i hope that i will like it. on tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. i want to find out what they had to do to get them. someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 gpa. i'll bet that there is more to it than that. but i want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. if i have to get a loan, it will look better. it will also make me more elligible for scholorships. i am going to need the money. next year, i think that i will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. i think that i would like that more than living in a dorm. it is too noisy here. my roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and i always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. i know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when i am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, i just want to scream. but next year i will have my own place by myself. that will be nice. the only problem will be that i will have to cook for myself. i don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. that probably won't be very nourishing. i will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. maybe melinda and i could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while i go to school. she could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. but i don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. i would really like to help her out, but i don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that i helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. it was very irritating, also. still, she is a very good friend that i know will always care for me. she is very nice. i just don't think that she is very good handling money. but not everyone is good at that. she is very good with kids, and i'm not very good with them at all myself. i never know what to say to them. i start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, i run out of stuff to say. my cousin dillian liked me pretty much though. my mother was telling me about how he was so excited that i always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. but i was pretty bored when i was watching him. i couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. it wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour.

"it's been almost a week since i have moved to austin to study. there have been times when i miss home, as well as times when i call my dorm room home. i don't understand why exactly i am here. none of this makes any sense. i've grown up, studying at a small school, small church, small community type settings, and i've thrown myself into the largest university in the nation, surrounded by many diverse students of all kinds. my friends have made the transition easier, as well as comforting. however, there's still a little void inside of me. where did it come from though? i see that naturally, god has some sort of plan for me here. but as of now, i have not a clue. no reason, no rhyme. and here i am writing my psychology assignment on the day it was assigned. this never happens. i am the one who's lazy and always procrastinates to the last possible second before even lifting a finger towards any assignment handed my way. yet, i feel like a change is about to occur. a transformation possibly, from a cocoon to a butterfly so to say. leaving behind the old, and embracing the new as it comes my way. i look around my desk, seeing my personal belongs as it reflects my own personality, my soul, my spirit. and i realize, that i'm lacking. i have my mere clothing, and books for my classes, my computer. the only thing that resembles anything about myself is my jars of clay poster, given to me by a friend. this poster is the only tangible object, image to represent myself. do i lack a soul, or have i yet to express it in a more productive manner? why am i even writing about this anyway? why did i begin writing this so early? regardless of it all, i know that he has a plan for my life. everything i do has a purpose for the sake of his glory. whether people acknowledge his existence or not, he is still there and is all powerful. two plus two is four, never five. god is here, and always will. people can choose to ignore him, but his existence still remains. i miss my youth pastor, gary, who taught me to seek god with everything i have. he was the kind of man who'd parents would approve of as a personal mentor. his wisdom and knowledge of every concept in the world baffles me, and kept me curios. but it's his compassion that i miss the most. the tears he shed, when he heard of a young boy committing suicide because his peers perpetual teasing. the affectionate, unconditional love he expresses towards his wife and children. these things, i miss the most. but the one true divine aspect about gary, is that he's a man of god. a man who sought after god without ever holding back. he dove in. not caring where or how, when or why, he dove in. will mankind ever see a man like him again? i look at the clock, and my twenty minutes is almost over, only a minute left for my required writing time. did i do the correct assignment? did i do this the way my professor wanted me to? oh well. blah.

"well, i'm at ut now, and boy, is it a different life. everything is different now; no more mom's home cooked meals and i have to do my laundry now. i'm going to go back every two weeks and take my laundry home. i will only need two weeks' worth of clothes and then i can take it all home and get them washed. one main thing i like about ut are women! wow, there are some sexy women here. then again, there are also the ugly girls. they will always be around, but at ut, the ratio of hot to ugly girls is much better than what i have seen before; at least that's what it seems like. i guess women are the motivation to stay here in school. i could never go to an allboys school. i would go crazy! there would be nothing to look forward to. talking about women, i went back home last weekend and i met my very good friend, stephanie. we have been friends for years, but only recently have we gotten really good friends. for example, she took me out for dinner and a movie before i had to leave for college, and she has been telling me how much she will miss me. i think ever since i broke up with my old girlfriend, stephanie has gotten closer to me. i am definitely happy about it. she is the sweetest girl i know, and she looks great too. i've been emailing her quite often and i plan to visit her every time i go home. college relationships can be hard when the person you like lives far away. the main reason my relationship with my last girlfriend ended was because of college. she mainly did not want to go through a longdistance relationship, and i agree with her. however, i have known stephanie for way too long, and there is no way that i can simply ignore her. well, i'm not sure what to talk about now. i'm in my room and i really do not want to do this psychology assignment. my friend just called me and he asked me to play a computer game with him. i really want to play, but i still have to type what is on my mind. i am going to talk some more about stephanie. i guess, she is the main thing that is on my mind. i cannot stop thinking about her. her high school homecoming is coming up this october, and i think i will tell her that she can go with me if she has no one else in mind. after all, we went together last year. i am pretty sure that she knows that i have a crush on her. especially since i gave her a kiss on the cheek two nights ago. i was surprised when she asked me to come over and watch a movie with her. she looked terrific that night; i'm pretty sure she wanted to look good for me. either way, we had a good time and i made her laugh several times. i think it is really important to keep a girl happy in order to have a healthy relationship.

"i just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where i live. i just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an ethernet. my boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. he goes to baylor. he hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. i am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, i can be really anal at times. i am sorry if this looks messed up, but i couldn't figure out how this works. sorry again. i sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an ""f"". i really miss my boyfriend. i am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. i don't know if i am in good enough shape to make the team. i haven't danced in like four months, and i am really out of shape. i am adjusting pretty good i guess to the whole college experience. i have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and i are going shopping at the mall at 4 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. i am misspelling words right and left huh. i am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, i hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting i have no more classes today, but i need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. my boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. i think he had a good time. we went out to eat at el arroyos, which was rumored to have good tex-mex food. they were right, alright. some of the best i've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. he stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on saturday. he came over to srd and we went shopping on the drag. i got two t-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, i think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because i'm here. i don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but i hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to baylor's. we then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. he needs 24 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 26, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. amy just walked in and said hi!. now she looked at my screen i'm not crazy, i am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me. i needed to get this done today because i have plans for the rest of the week after wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. i should've recorded what time i started typing, huh! that would have been beneficial. i'm retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes i have no common sense. i wonder what my grades will be like this semester. i am used to straight a's, and i hope i can accomplish this in college as well. i need to petition my ap grades sometime soon, but i don't know when or where. oh, well, i'll look it up somewhere, and get it done. i need to do some laundry today, too. i am running out of plain little t-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe i'll find something cute while i'm shopping today. i hoe my boyfriend ( jaron is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think i am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what i am engraving into it. so he'll remember. i am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. i need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz i am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know i live at 27th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. i think i have been typing for twenty minutes so i am going to submit this. i wonder what happens if i didn't type for twenty minutes. what if i don't get credit. maybe i'll keep going for another minute. i checked my mailbox when i came in, and i didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. i think i am running out of things to say, so i'll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line.

"right now i am sitting in my dorm room. wondering whether or not i should do this on the word processor. because this assignment seems so fun that even if the information doesn't get there, i wouldn't mind doing it again. i accidentally just sent you people a blank page because i forgot to scroll down. i really miss home. i have the music on and i keep finding sad music to listen to because it reminds me of my family. i don't think that i will mind this later, but right now, i'm having a bit of trouble adapting to this new life. i am not really too sad, just extremely disoriented. there are only a few people here who i am good friends. even my boyfriend has changed, and seeing him change (he has been here for three months)makes me wonder how much i will change this year. he even looks different. i think that being in college makes him more attractive, just because he holds himself differently. i wonder if i will look different. i already feel more independent and mature, even though i think that i always have been. just being away from home gives me a bit of a different perspective on things. people are up here and they are talking about how they are "" independent because they are doing their own laundry""! i sit there thinking ""what! i have been doing my own laundry since i was in 6th grade!"" my parents brought me up, always encouraging me to help myself, meaning that they didn't want me to expect everyone to do things for me. out of all of my friends, i am the only one whose expenses (personal and what my scholarship doesn't cover) come straight out of my account. my parents don't plan on having to wire me any money this semester, or maybe even the next. i worked this summer and saved my money for that reason. i wanted to make things a bit easier on them. my friends talk about their depleted bank accounts, but even though they worked as well, the only thing that makes use of their money is anything that revolves around their personal interests (aka shopping) i had to buy my own books, a good three hundred dollars that i could have used for something else, even though i probably would have just saved it all, because i love the feeling of having money. it is not just the security, but the feeling of accomplishment, and feeling like i am not just throwing away my money on material things. even though i always want to shop and i always see things that i want, i never indulge because i feel like if i start i won't be able to stop. but seriously, i really do want some more clothes because i recycle the same shirts in a matter of a week and a half. that could also have something to do with the unbearable heat. it was 113 degrees the other day and i have four hours between classes. by the time i get back from my first two classes, i already feel all icky, so i change shirts. oh, today i went inside a sorority house. i don't really understand what the difference is between a dorm wing and a sorority. after all, they are essentially the same thing. you get food and shelter and you get to meet a lot of people. it is up to you to build that ""sorority"" with the people in your wing. but i think the same kind of relationship is possible for girls who are living in the dorm. speaking of girls, when my boyfriend moved up here, he and his roommate became friends with this girl who i don't like. she is over at their apartment day and night because her friend lives in the same complex. my boyfriend thinks that she is really funny, and i know that he thinks she is pretty because he told me so. it seems like they have more in common than we do. i am a really jealous person and i am really jealous of her. i feel like she is better in every way than i am. she is taller and prettier. and he laughs at her so much. my boyfriend cheated on me once in the very beginning of our relationship, with his exgirlfriend. i think that by nature i am already a jealous person, (wow pepsi one is really gaseous because i never burp and this is the first time i have ever tasted it. i just burped out of nowhere) where was i? oh yeah. since he cheated on me it is really hard to trust him. so far he has betrayed my trust but i can't help but forgive him because i feel so much for him. i always looked down on people, girls, who let guys walk all over them. and even though it may seem like that is what's happening, that is not the way i see it. i don't no why. i know that it sounds really naive, but i feel like we are different. now i know that you should not judge people or assume things about them until you have been in their position. i know that i have been talking for more than twenty minutes, and i really don't like thinking about these boyfriend crises, even though i do it more than i should. anyway that is the stream of my consciousness.

"this is really boring, i'm so tired, i think i might take a nap after this but i have to write my social work notes. i wonder what will is doing in his class right now, i think this exercise will show that i think about him too much. i wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message i sent to her cell phone? should i go home this weekend? if i go home, i think i'll want to stay there, but if i don't go home i'll miss seeing my lil brother and i know he really wants to see me, its a good thing i haven't told him i'm thinking about it yet. i really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. i wonder if by getting him tickets i'm encouraging him to ditch class. i don't want to encourage him to do that, i want him to do well more than anything because i know that he wants out of utsa so bad. i hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, i type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. i wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. i guess it is keeping me awake. i'm so tired, i just want to sleep once in awhile. i actually did sleep last night, i only woke up once i think. its so hard to sleep, i don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. i was so tired that i took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, i think he might be one of the best people i know. i wish more guys were like russ. i wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. i wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. i wish i could make more friends too. oh, i made a friend today in sociology. i let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. i hope i don't do that, but since i have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, i feel like such a pathetic loser here. i have friends, i really do, i keep telling myself this. but i don't think anyone here believes me. i walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when i have to. its such a pathetic existence. then i come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. i talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. i wish they were here. i hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. i wonder how he is. i hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. i think he probably does miss having everyone around. i wonder if marc is ok. i think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person i know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, i wish i was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. i think i was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. i was never like the prom queen or anything, but i had about a ton of friends, and i knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. i miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, i want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl i don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, i was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. i felt kinda bad for ditching the yl ppl, but i think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. i don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. i don't know, i tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. i can't believe his mom thought we were. i can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, i wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. i wonder where that frame i made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. i'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. i really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that i want him to get out of utsa and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. i wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. i hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together i think. i can't believe that i miss everyone so much, and i can't believe that i care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. i wonder how he is. i can't believe he had a girlfriend. i wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is i'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. i'm not understanding that. i wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? i can't believe she would smoke. i bet she couldn't believe i would drink. why does armando think i would give it up to will. i may like the guy, but that doesn't mean i want to jump in a bed with him. i hope he was just kidding. i wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. i hope that doesn't happen to will, i hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too i'm sure if he pushes me. i hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave utsa so that he doesn't ruin will. i hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. i know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would i do if he died and i was the last one to talk to him, and i knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? i would feel guilty. but there's nothing i could do about it. i couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well i don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa?

"the on e thing in my mind right now is obviously college. i didn't really have to study to get past high school, but i foresee a lot of changes in my schedule, just 20 min ago i did all my math homework for the first time in maybe a year. if studying was my chief concern than i would be perfectly satisfied. unfortunately that is not my only concern. i am originally from houston, so as much as i hate to admit it i miss my home, and even my parents. there are so many things about home that i miss, thing that i nerve thought would matter, things like going to the bathroom. well i miss the past, and i am worried sick about the future. how will i do in my first test? how will i register for spring classes? will i have enough hours to graduate with a bs degree in biology? will i get into medical school? if i don't get into medical school, then what will i do? obviously time is the only thing that will answer these questions. but you can not help but worry about them. ever since i was little i wanted to be a doctor. well not from the beginning, i have wanted to be a doctor ever since i was 11. that is when i had a brain surgery. after that i wanted to use the life that was saved by another as a tool to save other people. there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in me but one thing that has stayed consistent within me is my passion to help others. the one thing that made me feel occurred when i was 5. my grandfather and i were walking down a street when we ran into a beggar. my grandfather had just bought me my favorite kind of ice cream. when my grandfather took the ice cream from me and gave it to the beggar. at that time i hated i'm for it. . but when i went to sleep that night all i could see was the gleam in the eyes of that beggar. it was at that time that tears starting coming out of my eyes. i felt proud that i had participated in something so beautiful. being a doctor to me is the best to repay god, and my family, and those doctors that saved my life. the one thing that i am afraid of is the one thing most people are afraid of. failure. fear of failure has always driven me forward, it is my opinion that fear of failure is the one thing that keeps this world going. everybody has a goal in their life and the fear of failure makes them work as hard as possible. hopefully one day i will walk out of a doctor as a doctor, who just helped saved someone life. . that would be a dream come true.

" today is a dreary day. the clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. i think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. i almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. i don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if i just think it is because that is what i have always thought. i want to be quiet. silent. reflective because i need some time to think and not be social. i don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. i think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. i need to go to that church that kelly went to , but i don't know how to get there and i feel bad that i didn't go today, even though i went to bed at 4. i need to do a better job next week. i really am begining to miss omar and my family. living in austin is fun but i think i am going to get sick of it if i don't take charge of my life now. i want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. i want to be different and i haven't found exactly what i'm looking for. i still haven't found what i'm searching for. it is really hot in here. i wish i could turn the air down. but katy is asleep. she is so crazy. i guess i like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. but i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if i am not careful. i really want to go shopping but i don't have time. maybe tomorrow. i want to buy so many things. i have so many ideas but i have no money. whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. i could have so much fun if i had a whole bunch of money. i would go to all the vintage stores in austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. i think then i would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? i wish that i was bulletproof. i wish omar was here. we could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. we need each other. he can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. and i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. it would be so great. oh well, i don't think that will happen. last nite was soo crazy. but i am glad i went, just because i need to experience all that i can so i can really know what i stand for and am comfortable with. if i just stay here and do things i know, then i will never be sure if i am really being real, or just what i think is real. i need to try everything so i will know what i'm not missing. or what i need to get more involved in. i hope heather, athena and i can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. i think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. i can't belive i cut myself on my bed today. that is so retarded. and it really hurts. i think allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how omar and ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. i can't belive it. i love radiohead. it is so comforting. at least i don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. it is a strange feeling but i really like it. it's like, i can do anything and no one will know if i don't want them to. that is a eerie and almost scary feeling. sometimes, when i consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. i am tempted to think there are no little things. i hope omar will write me a song sometime. he really needs to. i can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. i wonder if i just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. i would think that naturally he would, but then again i can rarely predict him. he would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. that is sad. i really wish he would be different . he has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. ahh. ohh well, it will work out. i am glad i have him, because i don't want anyone else,. . no one. i a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. well, this is almost the end. the end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. i have so much to do today. i love this music. i want to paint. i need to create something beautiful, and be productive. this is actually the beginning. not the end. here i go. this is going to be one great year. i have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep.

" how necessary is sleep? the past few days, i have been going to morning swim practice and then my 8 a. m. classes. is only four to five hours enough? i know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. but is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. right now i am feeling somewhat tired, but know that i have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will i get use to this kind of sleep cycle. also i wonder if i am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. are my notes as good as they should be or should i be taking more during class? i write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do i need more details in order to do well. the past few days i have recieved two different parking tickets, that i thought were unnecessary. i double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. the signs indicated that i wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if i could find a spot. but after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, i guess i now have to pick a different location. i wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. i wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. the front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. this is mainly because of the lack of evidence that i have, which i think is incredibly stupid.

"well i am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering i hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. too bad that i have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study i will be leading for kappa that i have little time to rest i really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because i have so much going on that i feel guilty if i am not always being productive. i know that i need to take time every day just to sit with god and tell him what is going on in my mind. so that's what i want to do with this exercise i am going to type everything i think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to god. i hate that i feel like i constantly need to be watching my money, or what i eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like i am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? i know i human, and that i am sinful and that i can't do anything on my own. so i don't know why i get disappointed in my failures, why should i expect anything else??? i feel pretty guilty about how much time i put into some of my relationships as well, like i wish i was there for lauren f. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. i also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, i need you to make me aware of when i start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when i start to keep a constant tab on how much i spend or what people owe me. lord i want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something i deserve because i know that i do not! i also know that i need to take a nap this afternoon if i want to get any work done later so i pray that i would be able to do that as well. i have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. you and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. lord i want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. i feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when i can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. i really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do! i hate that i was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, i am also so worried about david, mp, and nancy, i just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you lord, and understand your love for them. i wish i knew what to expect on this phl test coming up on thursday, but there i go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. i am worried that i am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as i should be but i know that i am doing the best i can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. i am so glad i got to spend time with ford this weekend and i really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in atlanta because i know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. but i know he was supposed to be here this weekend and i am so glad that he got to talk to chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. i feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason i am really upset that the tuna fish i bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $4???? come on louise you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly i am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but i know that i need to be really giving that to you and i really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. i am really hot so i had to go turn on the fan. i wonder when becca and martha are getting back, is it wrong that i kind of like that they aren't around right now? why is it that i like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? i am kind of worried about kyle maybe liking me, i really don't want him to, because i really love having him as a friend and i really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason i've been getting that vibe lately so i really hope that i can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. man that 7up stuff i got is disgusting!!! why do i always try those things. healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. i really hate that i am always feeling like i need to be repaid when i do something for someone i mean seriously! why can't i just give out of love and show like grace like christ did to us??? i am really excited about this psych class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. i am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep i got on saturday i really need to get rest because i know i don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! i just wish i would enjoy it i pray that i could have a peace so that i could sleep right now.

"okay. so i need to write what's on my mind. right now all i can think of is that chemistry test i just took at 9:30am this morning. it was my first test in college i was scared as hell before i took it because i was scared i would run into problems i didn't know how to workout and i would not pass the test. now i'm sitting in anxiety for the results. i keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. i have butterflies in my stomach. i'm trying almost anything i can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. goodness i feel so behind in my classes and i don't know why i mean i have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and i got time to relax, but can't. again that stupid test is on my mind. why does it torture me so? i'm sitting here praying i will get an 'a' on it because i gave it the best shot i could have even if i had studied continuously the whole week, i wouldn't have been able to do better. i guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. the entire thing was a review for me from chemistry ii my junior year. my stomach is in huge knots and i feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and i don't like it. those warning signs usually mean i'm in trouble for something, but i don't know why yet why i could be in trouble. i hate not knowing things. it makes me feel so vulnerable and i hate being put on a spot like that. my gosh i hope i didn't fail the test, otherwise i'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. i just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. i wish i could relax right now. maybe i'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as i'm through typing this assignment i still have 9 more minutes according to the clock. man, i really hope i run into siddharth today again that boy is really cute! but one thing puzzles me does alvin like me? he always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us bull crap they will! i think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. man! that test, but it's not that anymore i feel like i'm in trouble and i don't know why is everything okay at home? i sure do hope so. why do i concern my self so much everything will be okay no? hey! need to write my cousins i really don't feel like writing sonu now, i'll write him over the weekend when i go home. man i've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 20 minutes are over i hope this assignment is long enough i don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind i've never done that i've always had to think what i write and it's terrifying because any minute i feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and i'll get a zero.

" consious stream of thinking huh. i don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. these chicken taquitos sure are good. a lot of greese though. ya know, i really like musicals, but only ones from andrew loyd webber and ones from the late 19th century like gilbert and sullivan. speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. topsey turvey that is. i wish there had been more in there from the pirates of p. but it was still pretty good. i can't believe that i have a lecture to go to at 5 to 6:30. at least is isn't on friday. that would really suck. i should download some songs from the beatles. in fact, i should buy the yellow submarine on dvd. that would be a good movie to have. i wonder what movie i should go see this weekend. i haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. i wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. i'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. oh well. i need to write kim an e-mail. i haven't see her or kate in a really long time. they would probably appreciate that. i'll do that tonight after i finish reading the iliad. i need to read the rupublic. i meant to a year or two ago, but i never got around to it. i didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now i'm really getting into it. i don't know if i really want to bother learning guitar or not. i know it is never something that i would seriously persue, but still. at least i've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. i might as well, i see to have plenty of time on my hands. except for in the mornings. the past two mornings i've set my alarm early so i could wake up and get some reading done for class. too bad that both mornings i've overslept and yesterday i was late to physics. not that it really mattered. i could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. it's easier than what i took in high-school. my mom called me the other day. i was at starbucks, so i didn't really talk very long. i'll have to call her back tonight when i get in. i'm sure that they miss me. it doesn't feel all that different then when i was at home. i guess i might be homesick if i was going to school in like vermont or something like sara is, but i'm 3 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. i guess it helps also that i stay busy. i also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. i really want to go buy a phantom of the opera cd today. i'll see if they have it at barnes and noble although it will be an outrageous price. sarah brightman is a really good singer. it really helped that she was married to webber. that must have been a big career booster. it really doesn't see like i've written all that much. there is a lot more goig on in my head, but i just can't get it all out. some of the musicals that i really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. they just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made.

"the way i feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. i have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. to be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. currently i feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. i live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. the people at jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than i. i don't believe i am as happy about being in college for this reason. i love meeting new people. i find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends i left behind. i seem to dwell on the past lately. i go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. i work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. i many times dwell onthe question ""why do i not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. "" i guess part of the reason i feel this way is simply because as a child i was teased about being overweight. i guess i developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. i've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. it is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. personally i tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. i also worry excessively about my grades. i guess from reading what i wrote my biggest feeling'emotion is lonliness.

"i'm currently thinking about what i just finished writing to dr. pennebaker about, my broken relationship. it was so beautiful, and the worst part is that the feeling, that beautiful feeling is still inside me. i feel it everyday: in class, before i go to bed, when i wake up. i remember the feeling of being with him, and i miss it. i miss him so much. i hate having taken him for granted. i hate the fact that things could have worked out, had i simply admitted to myself that i had fallen for a guy. that's all i needed to do. all i could do was ignore him, laugh at him, all this while trully knowing there was something else. i did all of this knowing that i meant none of it. i was fighting it! i was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth, all guys are the same. they're all jerks. be careful who you fall in love with. don't fall in love in high school, it's too soon. you have your whole life ahead of you. "" i knew they were only trying to protect me, i knew they were saying this because they themselves having been guys, knew what it is guys were after. but no, not hugo! he was different. he wasn't horny or all over me, or asking me weird sex stuff. not once did he do this. not once did he push me into something i didn't want to do. not once! we dated for a year, and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other's foreheads and cheeks. this was it. and god did he do stuff for me. i hated saying i needed something or felt a certain way in front of him, because he had always go out of his way to help-always! for valentine's day, he designed a shirt that said, ""monica, will you be my valentine?"" i remember that morning, walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something, knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me. i hugged him, nodded, and smiled. that was all he needed. i don't know what i wouldn't do to have those feelings all over again-with him!?! i dream about laying beside him, while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders. and just watching him breathe, watching his chest rise and lower, as he breathes. wow! such an amazing sight. now, all i have are our memories, most of them of me being a 'bitch' to him, treating him so unfairly. maybe he does deserve better than me, maybe this is all part of god's plan. but you see, i know god knows me and he knows i have a big heart, but am just afraid to show it. he knows this. he knows how sometimes, it's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection, or something or other. but what now? should i wait? i guess so. deep down, i have this feeling that it is not over between hugo and i by a long shot. i know it's not over by a lot. i remember how hugo treated his parents, better than i've ever seen anyone treat their parents, with such respect and love. i've always had this thing that a guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother. his dad also, that man is really such a good person. he really does have a lot to offer to his family, and i know hugo too is this type of person. i only hope he knows this about himself. i only hope he knows everything he is worth. i only hope that he knows how i truly feel about him, how i've truly felt about him this entire past year. i hope he knows that behind every crude and hateful action or word, there was an enormous amount of love just trying to get through. there was an enormous amount of love just trying to beat all the hate, and although it might have been a little late, it has been released. it has gone through all the hate. it lives in me today, right now, right this instant as i am typing, and will live in me for a very long time, if not-eternally.

"okay, here we go. i am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. i don't know how i can do this considering that i type pretty fast and also i am in the ugl and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that i type. oh well, no one seems to be listening. i am really tired right now and all i can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. it's only been one minute! i can't do this for that long. i have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm i had a fun time last night. i got in at 6 in the morning. if only my mother could see me now. that's the latest i've ever gotten in. am i typing loud? i don't want to do this anymore. i am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that i am typing. bored bored bored bored. i miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in barnes and noble i was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and i really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow i held it back. hell right now i want to cry. i really miss all of my dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. i guess it's inevitable, though. i mean i've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but i never thought that it really would be this hard. i'm living on my own. i am my own mother now. that's pretty damn scary! i think i'm responsible though. i've always been able to manage my time wisely. even my mom agrees with that. it's only been 3 minutes. or 4 maybe. i really like this guy i met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. i'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. i hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. i'm really paranoid right now. i don't want him to see that i'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks i'm stalking him anyway. i'm really not. i think i am inventing things in my head. i do that a lot. i can't believe i'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. well, hopefully not. i mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. yikes! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least i am assuming that it is. so, with that in mind i really am open to write whatever the hell i want to write. this is for my benefit, in essence. like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! i really like that guy. i hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe tuesday. hell, i'm sick of waiting around for this guy. i always do this. i cling on so fast to people i'm interested in even after just meeting them. it's like i have a onetrack mind and it's all i can think about. that's pretty scary, huh? wow i just scrolled up and i've written a lot. a lot of really boring stuff too. he probably won't call tomorrow. who am i kidding? i can't keep doing this to myself. it's really unhealthy. i just want to cry after realizing this. it's such a horrible thing. i am putting this guy up on a pedestal is that how you spell it? and like if he messes up just a little bit, then i think that he hates me and i'm just this horrible person. god i say the stupidest things around him sometimes. i'm so concerned with trying to impress him that i just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but i am again blowing it out of proportion. who am i kidding, i need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. like everyone i meet, i hold off on just for that rare chance that i might get to date this guy. i am a weird person. i am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. it feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. whoa that's scary. i love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. not really. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. i feel like each letter i type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. how did that go so fast? what did i write about? i can't even remember. i really don't want to look back at what i wrote either because i'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but i'm sure i will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, i envy your patience. until next time. that is all.

"i'm now worrying about what to write which is really irrelavant because to the instructions. i am at a loss. when the mind watches itself most of it stands still. but when it stops being vigilant it wanders anywhere and everywhere past, and future. again i can think of nothing when watching the mind think of something which is very ironic. and again it stops and doesn't go anywhere when i try to see where it is. i hope i don't bomb this paper which i'm not sure how its to be graded. i bet my grammer really sucks, if i can use that word ""suck"" but i shouldn't worry about my grammar because it doesn't matter according to the instructions yet because of insecurities i still worry about my presentation, any presentation. now i am talking to my friend and being distracted, but since i reallize it i'm no longer distracted. what else is going through this undeveloped mind of mine, wow, that rhymes, mind and mine, ok, i probably sound really stupid now but am just following instructions. the phone rings, and i think that it may be my mother checking up on me which she already did, but i'm sure would not hesitate to do it again. room is now quiet with everybody gone, no distractions except for the unknown mind with all of its mysteries. funny its always with us yet we know next to nothing about it which maybe this class will attempt to shed some light on but i doubt it will do very much good for anyone to decrease thier pains and increase their happiness. everything in psych. is great but helps no one if it serves no purpose such as increasing the quality of ones life. philosophy i believe tries to a bit more to do just that but is so abstract and too much of a subject to be studied than to be experienced and learned which doesn't help anyone anyways except to tickle and play with the intellect. unless a certain form is adapted to the way of living and adopted as the way of thinking will it help those who really seek help. now i'm a little afraid all that i just wrote is irrelevant to the assignment and will recieve a bad score. perhaps another manifestation of insecurity. this world today is full of insecurities, fear, though we have everything anyone could want in the west, but yet we lack that which cannot be externaly obtained. how ironic that most of us strive in life but never know what we are striving for, what steven cohen calls personal management but lack of personal leadership, direction. because we seem to have everything we want but are actually lacking we don't know where to direct our constant thirst for happiness and constant aversion of suffering. but the cause of our pains is ignorance, the lack of wisdom, wisdom - understanding but mostly realizing how things really are. perhaps to this is to philisophical for the assignment. but as thoughts come into my head i write just like the instruction say. although i can think of no reason for this assignment excpet to observe the mind, but i can not see anything to learn. yeah, maybe the next assignments are also like this, but probably not, wishful thinking. almost done, just two more minutes and i maybe will continue the other assignments. our study hall in our dorm really sucks. its very creepy looking with all sorts of pipes and wires running through the wall. uh, oh, girl thoughts, probably not appropriate, i don't even know if i spelled that word correctly. my mama told me that mastery over the mind is the highest form of victory anyone can have. it is said that a man may conquer a thousand people and a thousand lands, but it is far better to conquer himself just once.

"so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. i wonder if i should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 3 or 4 a's. i could be one of those a's. but what if i'm one of those c's that she says are ""solid writers""?? wish i was a good writer. after i read must read chemistry and psychology if i don't start soon i'll never start. and lord knows if i get behind in any of my classes, i'll never catch up again. i'm glad that i bought the notes today for chemistry. now i know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 7:30pm i can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. i'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. i've gained so much weight already. i wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. i bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. i'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. i should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes i just eat because there's nothing to do not because i'm hungry. i know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although i'm skinny, i'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. i know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says i'm everything anyone could ever want but i have so many flaws. for instance, i have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. i hate being late. that's probably why i'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks i'm a nerd but i just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. i like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. i always try to get ahead. that's why i'm always so stressed out. sometimes i wish i was not such a worry wart. i want to be laid back, really i do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. i tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. i guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should i eat for dinner. it's $0. 30 chicken wing night at pluckers. i live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but i still have left overs in the fridge so i'll save myself the 3 or 5 dollars and eat in again. i wish i was rich. i wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. i remember the day when it used to be like that. but i'm glad i ran away. i'm with jeff now and he's better than having all the money in the world. i kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving. ut isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an ivy league school but i highly doubt that. i would pick an east coast school over hicktown ut anytime. but since i'm here i have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means i can start thinking about what to do next. i think i'll read psychology since that's what i'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric i have to read chapters two through three. i think i've got it together now. 4 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now i just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. i have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, i guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. i think i'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. i guess that's it. i enjoyed this project!

"i just set my alarm on the cell phone because i didn't want to over write or something. i'm listening to fiona apple's song. it's called across the universe, i think. i don't know if i was supposed to put quotations around the title of the song. yes, i'm sure that's what i was supposed to do. this writing assignment is kind of weird cause i don't know what i'm supposed to be writing about and sometimes this freedom makes me kind of weird on the subject. too much freedom isn't always comfortable, i guess. i can't stop thinking about how bad i feel that i didn't go to my philosophy class on tuesday. it's not because the professor sucks. or at least i don't think it is cause i know he does kind of not get the point across. he's too vague. too much vagueness and too much freedom. both are not good especially if you want structure. i need structure in my life. i do because sometimes i think that i know what i'm doing and what i want to do but it just doesn't work out that way and i think it's because i just want things to be scheduled or i can't get them done. i don't' know how to structure my life, though. this song makes me so depressed even though i like it a lot. i don't know what to write about. i don't know if i'm supposed to continuously type, without stopping, or if i can stop to think about what i want to write about but not get away from the computer. i feel like my writing isn't quality writing here, but i guess that's the point of writing this. i've been writing for four minutes. i know. i stopped to look at the clock. i want to talk to my boyfriend. we got into a fight today because he was upset that i didn't call him and went over to a friend's dorm room. i know that's not what he's upset about though. i know it's because this friend of mine is a guy. i hate that he's so jealous like that. i mean, i don't mind if he wants to show me that he cares, but getting upset with me and hanging up with me like that, i just don't like. especially embarrassing me in front of my friend. i've known my friend, jonathan, longer than i have been with my boyfriend. i don't' know. i guess my boyfriend is just paranoid. i love him a lot though. i just wish we had what we had in the beginning of our relationship: blind love and trust. i don't know. i guess that once you go out with someone for so long, things just fly away and you're left with what you always thought you weren't going to do and be and say and feel. i understand why some women cry about their husbands beating them but yet they don't leave. it's called love with a condition. she loves him because she's been with him for so long. i'm thinking that maybe if i didn't type so fast, i wouldn't end up with too much for this writing assignment. first of all, i think this is the coolest writing assignment. not only because we have this freedom, which i think can get a little demanding. i think it's neat because we can write what we think. it isn't an essay on the revolution of blah blah. it's what i feel and think and want to say, which is always nice, especially in writing. i'm used to doing this though i guess cause i write in my journal often. i never type though, so i guess i'm getting more said. and believe it or not, i always worry about space on my journal. like, i worry that i'll ""waste"" too many spaces on only one entry. i think i'm so weird. i guess i do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much. i am like that in many ways i guess. but i'm also guessing it's a better trait to have than not. i don't know. my computer is making funny noises. i hate my computer cause i paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it doesn't even shut down properly. plus, stupid dell won't help me any. i write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that don't even work. i've already tried a million times. it makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk. i miss home. i wish i could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight. i'm gaining so much weight. i lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that i looked anorexic. now that i'm in austin, i've already gained those ten back and i'm scared that now i'll turn into too big of a girl, that ill be that girl, the bigger one than all the other girls. i was only maybe 110 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 90, i looked bigger. maybe that's why they never wanted to go out with me. i don't know. maybe it's cause i'm korean, i don't look like most of the people where i'm from. the rio grande valley: either you're mexican or some type of mexican. even the general white population was considered a minority there. anyway but yeah i used to be cheerleader'student council president and all other kinds of stuff in junior high and i got to high school and cheerleading sucked because i was a freshman and everything else sucked. all my friends turned into druggies. about half of them went to rehab. i feel bad for them. but then again. i don't know. they're here at ut with me. well, most of them. does that mean i'm almost equivalent to a druggie? i've never done any drug besides drinking and smoking cigarettes and even that i don't do often. i wish i could find answers to some stupid questions that are so insignificant. whatever. all i know is that i want my future to bright and successful. i actually want to write. i want to sit and write my poems and my thoughts and write a book, but i know that won't ever be possible. i wouldn't' be able to do it as my job, my career. i know i need food to eat and money to pay bills with and writing books, especially when you're barely starting off, won't get you too much on the table and in your pockets. i don't know. i wish i had the patience to go through medical school but i don't think i could, and besides, i suck at sciences. i would never be able to go through all those damn chemistry and biology classes. i would die. i really would. why would i want to shoot so high for a career that will only bog me down with way too many hours? actually, the guy i was talking about before, jonathan, he has an uncle who is a doctor and he's so rich and makes his own hours, basically. he's working in the er right now because he likes to travel, and er doctors can usually go work at whatever hospital. i'm so tired. my shoulders hurt. my boyfriend is coming tomorrow to see me. i'm so excited. we've been going out for two years. it's like we're both from the valley and it's like i'm going to be able to see a part of the old me, at home. i haven't seen him for two weeks, which is nothing compared to the long separation periods when i was a senior in high school and he was a freshman up at a&m. yup, he's an aggie. funny how i got to be a longhorn. i don't even have all that pride in being one. i didn't even look into buying a sports packet to go watch the game. i wish i was back to being my peppy self like i was in junior high. did i kill myself? or did i let other people kill me? did i let other people tell me i wasn't good enough? i don't know. i want it to be 9:24 so i can stop writing. my shoulders hurt and my neck hurts. i feel too pressured doing this. but yet, i like this writing assignment.

"at this moment i am in the fac computer lab typing away among about 100 other students. being a freshman, these first couple of weeks have been very hard of me. i live at home and commuting, to me at least, isn't a problem. but to other people, it is. they can't believe that i do. they think i have no life, won't make any friends and will be stuck at home my entire life. which some of that is true. i do have a life, school! i'm not going to ut to make friends, i'm paying to go here to get an education and make something of myself. not to party on the weekends, get drunk, have sex with random people and ""buy"" my friends by joining a sorority. i probably will live at home during my undergraduate career. and why not? i live 15 miles away, why spend $8000 on room and board? i saves so much money. i have a big family, 7 people. my older sister will be going to medical school in two years, i plan on law school, my little school wants to be a doctor too and my little brother doesn't know yet. that much education, plus tons of other expenses add up. we could afford to live on campus, but i like my room and bed at home. we're hoping not to take out any loans for all my siblings and mine education, since taking and charging interest go against my religion, islam. but enough of that. my classes are going well, except for this class, to be honest. i haven't done the reading. which i better do soon, and i know i will. i've heard james is a good teacher, and i'm a great student, so there shouldn't be a problem. i know most people, especially freshmen, are too busy being distracted and having fun that all they care about is passing the class, or making a b. which is fine. i really want an a though. difficult to most people isn't that hard to me, i've always been in ap classes and i can handle working hard, which not a lot of people can, and not a lot of people want to. besides school though i have two jobs. one at tinseltown usa, and a box office person, selling tickets. and the other at kaplan test prep, as an student advisor. i hate the latter. i wanted to quit so bad but they begged me to stay since a lot of people are leaving. the managers are so rude to the students, which is so wrong because they are paying $1000 to come there. but i only work sunday, so it's all right. i don't have a boyfriend, which i sometimes wish i did. i want a companion, someone i can always talk to and someone that will listen to me and love me. it's really lonely not having someone like that. there are guys i would date, but either they wouldn't date, they haven't asked yet, or i can't date them. the can't category being one of my managers from work. he is the nicest guy i have ever met in my entire life. he's genuine, caring, goodlooking and funny. he deserves the best. he's only 25, which is 7 years older than me. i'm pretty sure he doesn't have feeling for me, and that's ok. i like the friendship we have now. i can talk to him about whatever i need to and he'll always be considerate about it. i wonder no one has taken him yet? i would if i was ready to get married. i've taken a few weeks off from my theatre job so i don't see him. twenty minutes has gone by, but i like this. i didn't to clear my head. it's a good thing there is a writing assignment like this. i almost want to keep a journal now, which i've heard is a good idea. i think i'm going to go eat now, and then go to an si for this class. :) ",0,"[0.663323, 0.202119, 0.984765, 0.258714, 0.019735, -0.020158, -0.484164, 0.234068, 0.05235, 0.155524, -0.182335, 0.178101, 0.013423, -0.366654, -0.667803, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.549546, 0.021633, -0.117295, -0.008762, -0.742368, 0.132417, 0.325608, 0.394474, 0.685739, -0.397063, 0.594993, -0.5127, 0.354151, -0.43401, -0.129518, -1.115611, -0.906028, -0.482128, -0.753442, -1.440889, -0.781727, -1.100444, -0.145175, -0.499997, -1.01038, 0.021765, -0.754881, -0.820655, -0.035429, -0.514966, 0.203487, -0.188364, -0.131411, 1.276496, -1.42076, -0.561878, -0.108881, 0.510439, -0.857227, -0.846585, -0.352032, -0.108559, -0.282778, 0.329011, 0.114342, -0.054027, 0.030348, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.118441, 1.711, 0.064449, -0.23436, 0.176431, -0.194586, -0.337085, 0.238428, 1.02403, -0.451544, 0.356439, 1.181157, 5.017056, 4.011612, 4.82031, 4.863214, 4.624668]"

(plus, i won't be working at wal-mart, the consumer of business). speaking of stuff i love to do, i love music! i really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since i have been wanting to do architecture since i was like, four, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . . on a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the counter reset!!! nooooo! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read.

"i have too much homework to do. it is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours. the homework in ut requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time. also, at ut, you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management. also, there are a lot of distractions like girls, basketball, sleep, etc. going to early classes has been hard for me so far. it is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it. i think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about, or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand. this is because once you are lost, you really don't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed. i really think that my gpa is important this semester becuase i am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science. this is becuase i do not like computer science which is my current major, and business seems easier and a better track to go. today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection. it kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student's number really was. i want my parents to bring me a bike to ut. it is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes. but i kind of don't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair, you will have to pedal over hills, and cars don't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians. i am kind of pissed that the school is closing gregory gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party. i think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night. plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too. i really think that the ut football team is going to do well this year. although they blew a big first game, i think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year. i don't understand why chris simms chose to come to texas over tennessee. he is such a good quarterback to be a backup. i think he should be starting over major applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic. i really don't like to do these things because it takes so much time. when i first started typing i didn't realize how long 20 minutes is, but it is a long time. when i finish this, i need to start on my english paper, and do my calculus problems. my calculus ta is really stupid because she cannot teach us. she skips too many steps, and she can't explain problems very well. i think that radio stations should not have morning shows. this is because i was listening to a radio station in the morning that didn't use to have a morning show because they were new, but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music. also, they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to. i like it when it rains. but here in austin is never seems to rain. i've been here for 2 1'2 weeks now and not a drop of rain. when it rains i feel better for some reason. tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because i don't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon. and all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you don't learn anything. i like a girl here are ut but i don't know if she likes me back. but i am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to emory in atlanta. the girl that i like in ut though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that i am there. she also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous. the girl in emory is a girl that i've known for 4 years and i think i stand a better chance with her, but i hear that long distance realtionships never work out.

"okay, here we go. this should be fun. i just got done eating. i spent 4 dollars on lunch. i am whittling away at my alloted 1200 dollar food stockpile. anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. maybe one semester at the most. anyway, my classes are all over today except for ba101, but that class is more of a joke. i was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. it feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. i also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. if you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. it feels wonderful. i should be taking a nap. thats how i like to pass time. when i start reading, i usually end up falling asleep anyway. i have my first test of the year on tuesday. its a microeconomics test. i seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. maybe thats because i took it last year at my local community college. i was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. after that i learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. my finger is throbbing somewhat. i don't think i broke it, its just really swollen. i wish i could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. all this walking and such is tedious. i really should catch up with my reading. i have 3 classes that i need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. i liked the weather yesterday. there was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. i used to live in washington, so i am used to rain. its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. wow, 20 minutes seems like a long time. of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 20 minutes of sleep is nothing. thats for amateurs. i go for hour increments. i withdrew $60 from an atm last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 3 left. i didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. oh well, its only money (right. ) i am looking forward to ut's next football game. the one against north texas was crazy. people act so mob-like at those games. everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. it almost like we've been brainwashed. thats what tv does. without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. and another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. for example, athletes, entertainers. etc. there roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. one thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. they are just normal people! would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? thats doubtfull. but when frank from survivor africa is seen in san francisco, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. people find solace in the stupidest things. i have ventured away from talking about how much time i have left and began venting. now time is almost up. 15 seconds left. . 5 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. my bed is calling to me.

"well, today was ok in te beginning, i met lucy for our first class and we sat together we pretty much spent most of the day together i just didn't realize how easy it was to spend time with someone new. she is just someone who's easy to get a long with but after walking around campus for a million years we came to jester to check out the learnsing skills center and there was so much stuff there to help us study and do homework for cal and chem. the lady there was so nice and helpful, the trip was really worthwhile. i tried to buy stamps from the vending machine, but it just wouldn't take my money. i had to go back and forth too many times. finally i bought some out of the other machine where i didn't get ot chose which stamps i wanted which kinda pissed me off. then we went to dobie to visit karen and christy. while we were there i had fun. but then my ankle started hurting a lot and i guess i just walked on it too much. we went to eckerds to get my pictures and a lot of them look good. i was kinda mad that the pictures of the flowers and such i took got messed up and i can't retake them. oh well. i was kinda scared walking all the way back to kinsolving because ppl could see my injured ankle and someone could've just come up and assaulted me. at the time, i was kinda hoping someone would cause there's just so much stuff here that's depressing. when i got home, i was about to cry cause i was thinking again about how no one comes over here to visit me. i mean, who are my real friends (that is if i have any) they're so lazy they can't even come over here to visit. no one really calls me either. i just don't know how to describe it cause i know if i really wanted to talk to them i could just call, but well, no one really calls me. it's just frustrating cause while erin's out all these ppl always call and when she's over she's on the phone so much and she goes out every night. i know i don't need to go out and be on the phone all the time, it's just that it's really lonely not hving anyone over here all the time to keep me company. maybe if erin and i were more talkative or she was home more often. i don't know, it's just weird. what am i supposed to do about stanley? i mean, i actually would've gotten into a relationship with him even though i know it'd just be physical, but sometimes that's what i need. the touch of someone who cares. but i guess stanley doesn't really care. he just was thinking of himself and how he needed to satisfy his urges. it's not fair! it's not fiar at all that i have to be here alone when i see so many ppl on the outside who have b'f and g'f and they don't really look like they deserve them. i don't know where to go f' here cause i feel so lonely a lot and no one can really understand how i feel. crying right now. i don't even feel as though god understands or can hear how troubled i am. i just wish that there was someone who really cared, someone who'd always be here for me. but it's like i can't really count on anyone. everyone has their own life. and it's always about them. i don't like being alone. if i just killed myself, i could end all this, but i don't want to. but i do. i need to find out what the future will be like. even if i never find someone who appreciates me, if i can just somehow find some happiness. just a little. go one day where i don't cry or think about being lonely. just a little something. it's not fair. what do i do? it's hard to go on each day trying to endure the battles that come with each day. trying to face the hardships. if only i could do what i really wanted to do. scrapbooks and drawing and painting have money to do what i wanted to. build my dream house. design it, oversee the construction. one day. that's my dream. to have a wonderful house to live in. where i can go to find myself at peace. a weight room, sauna, spa, pool, greehouse, huge living room with a giant entertainment center, huge bedroom and bath, huge windows. a painting art room, dojo, so many things i want to do. but i don't know if that will bring me happiness. how am i supposed to be happy if i can't share the big house with someone i love. someone who loves me back. loves me as much as i love them. it's hard to think of what love is when i think that i've been there, and not been able to feel the same f' the other person. what am i doing here anyway?? there's nothing for me now. i'm so alone. alone in this room with no one calling me, asking me to do anything. what kind of friends do i have? no one is as considerate as me or maybe as sensitive as me. i just don't like being alone. if someone wanted to ask me out, in desperation. like donald said, being in love with the thought of being in love. maybe that's what i've been in with anthony. but i really thought he was the one. the one i could spend my life with . will i ever be able to fine someone to end my loneliness?

"i'm in the mood to write and so i decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes i get in this mood to write anything and everything that's on my mind. i guess it only happens when i'm bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so i don't know. how should i describe. i guess i was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being? why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. you'd think id get the hang of it by now. but i don't want to become like them. whoever's reading this. are you christian? i am. or i believe in god and his son jesus christ and i try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet i know i'm doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. i think i've got the harmless as doves thing down, but i'm not very wise. i always get so hurt. i don't know what to say. my thoughts don't seem to be flowing and i cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. i wish everyone were. how come i cant think. but i'm supposed to write for 20 minutes so i guess ill continue. no, i'm not totally disappointed with all people or anything if that's what it sounds like. in fact i love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. i gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet i always for her. she never once cleaned yet i never complained. i bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. i cared for her well being. i never said anything to hurt her. i don't even know how to describe. i really did care about her well being. as roommates, i thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and i tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. i gave up my bed and moved into the living room since we had a one bedroom. living with anyone's mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. i still cleaned. but she did cook. although i didn't eat at home that much. i tried to go home late and leave early because it wasn't very comfortable with someone else's mom at home. i tried my best. and i really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out i noticed i was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, i presumed she must have misplaced. so i left a note before i left for school to check for me - that i'm not sure how many silverware because i lost some in moving before and so its not too many i'm sure, but a few. when i came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, ""look! this is ours,"" then another wrapped piece, saying ""look,"" and more and more. i was so shocked. i told her i didn't mean to accuse her of stealing, if that's what she had mistaken it, but she said no, that's not it well its been over 20 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and i wasn't going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. i have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 2nd was only for the summer)and i hope everything goes well. i wrote about this because i saw my 2nd roommate today. and though we never fought i don't think were friends anymore. and every time i think of her, i'm hurt.

"this is a strange colored screen. i'm glad the page has a timer at the top, i really didn't want to keep track of time myself. i have so much work to do today, i'm just glad that i have lots of time to do it. i should probably make sure that i don't misspell words and all of that, it's not like i will have time to check it over when i'm done. i almost feel bad for whoever has to read this, i mean there's probably going to be a large amount of frighteningly boring writings (including mine). trying to write this with the tv on probably isn't a great idea either, so off it goes. this weekend should be a good time, but i'm still not looking forward to it. i still need to get a birthday present for a friend of mine as well. i should look online to see if she has anything going on the day of the mars volta show and get her tickets, that would be very cool. knowing my luck she probably won't be able to go, but i should still try. her parent like me enough to let her stay with me, but i don't know when she would go back home. hopefully she won't have a game that friday, or else none of this will work. i still need to help jessica with her homework, and somehow find time to go to practice tonight. this band really isn't as much fun as i thought it would be. in fact, the music is really boring me. i should talk to them about possibly adding or taking away parts to make it better. these guys listen to way too much indie rock, which means i probably won't have a good chance of making the music any harder. this is going to be a very long writing, so i apologize for whoever has to read this. i hope studying for latin doesn't take too much time tonight, because i need to get to bed early. it's amazing that i can wake up at 11:15 to be in class by noon, yet i am still tired even if i got like 10 hours of sleep. i don't know how people go to class at 8. i tried an 8:30 class this summer and i ended up not going to it more times than i went. i always figured that going to class would be the easy part; i was wrong. i can still manage to fall asleep in any class so long as its during some sort of lecture. maybe one of these days i should go to bed at like 8pm and just see when i wake up naturally. chances are i still won't get out of bed before noon. the night is such a better time to do things. its not incredibly hot, there's not as many people out, and there are a lot more interesting things to do at night (say on 6th street) than there is during the day. granted you can't exactly go clothes shopping at 2 in the morning, but you don't get to see bands play during lunchtime either. i can't wait for next weekend. going down to san antonio to see my friends play is going to be a great time. hopefully i can get some more friends to go with who might like their music. if not, oh well. they are playing with another band that i really enjoy as well, which should make for a very enjoyable time. i should spend more time in san antonio, there is a lot of stuff to do there. 6 flags is nice if you have the money, i just don't have the money as of late. i should really try to find a part time job up here so that i can have some resemblance of cash flow. maybe get a decent job and save up enough money to go somewhere this summer. i would really love to go on a cruise or something like that. unfortunately, i will probably end up spending the money on bass gear and food. i need food to live though, and bass gear is always good. i still need to do the pretesting after this as well. i don't have a printer either, that could be a pain. hopefully i can just save the page for printing and simply print it out after i go buy a printer. the time is almost up and it really didn't feel like it took long at all. maybe that is because i'm used to writing like 6 page papers, i like the simplicity of this. i wonder how many grammar rules i broke during the course of this writing. oh well.

"i'm busier than a one legged man in a butt-kicking' contest! i heard some statistic about how much college kids watch tv and i can honestly say that the only tv i've watched since i've been here is the football game because i haven't had enough time. i have a job, i'm in air force rotc, i'm in a fraternity, and i'm on a couple intramural football teams. i have all of this to do after studying and doing homework. i don't think that i feel really stressed about anything, of course no grades have come out yet, but physically its very demanding. one day in rotc i threw up 4 times as a result of probably being out of shape, but for the next week i just felt sick to my stomach. some of that might have something to do with the food in jester being the greasiest, most repetitive food i've ever eaten. also, i've lost 10 pounds since i've been here which disturbs me cause i used to work out every day and it sucks now that i can't. another subject that is scaring me is money. my parents pay for college, but i didn't realize how much id already be spending. my dad always told me to limit myself to a monthly budget, but of course i didn't listen to his advice and now i might be paying for it. literally. my class load isn't that bad except for calculus. this damn class is kicking my ass. first of all, my professor doesn't speak english very well, but sometimes that doesn't even matter because in a class of 150 students he refuses to wear a microphone or even speak up so that anyone beyond the first three rows can hear him. and when we can hear him he speaks in some sort of math language so that when i take notes i'm sure that when i look at them later i will of thought that they were notes from some ancient egyptian hieroglyphics class or something. so classes are going well!, now socially i have been having lots of fun. i've been lucky enough to meet a lot of girls but not smart enough to not date so many. i'm pretty sure i have a problem of leading girls on. for example there is this one girl who i've been hanging out with who i think ones to get a little more serious with me. now i'm just a freshman and i don't want to get serious with anyone yet! but if i try to conspicuously avoid her (i still call and am nice to her, i just don't go to her house or anything) she, like most girls, pick up on that almost instantaneously, then she tries to make me feel guilty for say not coming to see her or something. along with that there are some other girls who i've been talking to or seeing at parties. i guess you could say that i've been casually dating around, but next week there is this huge party and i'm really looking forward to it, but not to the awkward feeling of seeing all of these girls together at the same time because i'm sure all of them are going to be there. oh well!! i still love college.

"the lights are all out here in hardin house. thank goodness amy has this lap top so i can do this assignment. i still have to do the other one too. they both are due friday. the lights just came on. i'm so relieved because now i can feel the air conditioning. i'm a little bit off the assignment because cara is watching me. cara says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. i don't really know. tonight i need to go to the theta house and study. we have to get certain amount of hours done . i don't really want to read anymore of the great plains by webb. it is like a history book. it makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when i read it. the most interesting section was about the animals on the plains. the little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. i guess that's how it works. right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. i have about 70 pages to read tonight. it is a little overwhelming. sometimes i get behind and feel real guilty about it because i want to keep up with all my classes. i need to do my math homework too. i kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then i'll never get up. my bed is sooooooo cozy. i just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. i kind of feel like watching backdraft. whichever baldwin guy is in it is really good looking. he reminds me of this stratford guy that is living in towers. he is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. he walked us home the other night from the ka house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. i was thinking this guy is too good to be true. but then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. i don't think i would like to get in the middle of that. if that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. but he is one of the better guys i've seen around lately. i kind of want to just ver out tonight but i know that i'll feel bad about it later. i'm so into making good grades but i haven't quite gotten into the hang of doing homework in this new setting and everything. danielle just called. i'll be living with her next year. i think it'll be good. me , cara, allison, and danielle. i don't really know her too too well. seh and allison are friends. cara, allison, and i have been hanging out a lot lately. she's so cool. it's really awesome to get to know people from different states and become close friends. she's from oklahoma. oklahoma is so random. what is in oklahoma? maybe we'll all go there to see her family sometime. we might go to houston for the rice game. then i'll get to see my little brother. he is so cool. he's growing like a weed right now. it's crazy. now that i'm gone he is like an only child. i hate that for him. maybe he likes it a little. he gets all the attention now. i don't want to lose the awesome brother'sister relationship that we have right now because i'm 3 hours from home.

"well, i am now officially writing my first college paper"" more or less. it is really hot outside today. i wonder when it is going to cool of so i won't swear so bad when i walk to class. i think that i need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when i get them, instead of putting them off. it makes me feel like i am bogged down when i have a lot of stuff to do at once. it is actually really stressful. i kind of like this song that is on the radio. busta rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper, but i think that this song is ok. pharrell really makes this song what it is. now come to think of it. i don't think that busta rhymes sang that song. oh well i guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes, so i won't correct my mistake. my chair is pretty comfortable. hopefully i will do my homework in it when i am done with this writing assignment. the longhorns really kicked new mexico state's butt. i think that chance mock (the quarterback) got to a ruff start, but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the longhorn's quarterback. although vincent young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal, scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts, and throwing a great 60 yard pass, i believe that mock should continue to start as qb because he has put in his time as scout team player. my, that was a really long sentence. i am tired of eating the food at the jester food court. they have a big selection, but the selections never change at each station. i kinda miss my mom's home cooking. i can get over that. i was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus, but i guess that i didn't think that i would see so many people going to class everyday. i kind of feel like a minority in austin. coming from a small town in east texas that is mostly white, black, and mexican, i am not used to seeing so many asian students. i am not against asian people at all, i just have never seen so many at one setting such as ut. the temperature in my dorm is not to my liking. i am a very hot natured person, and i prefer that it be cold in my room. being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling. i dislike sweating when i sleep. i need to go to the gym today. i am getting out of my routine of working out each day. i need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play. it is kind of hard to be disciplined once you don't have your parents to tell you what to do. the experience at ut is a good one though and i am not complaining. the only thing i dislike about it right now is that i still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks. the co-op did not have my mis book today like that re-order said. nothing is ever perfect. that is not a bad thing though. i hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy czar. this is an easy grade. there are so many fine girls here at ut. everywhere you look you see a hottie. i love that. some of them seem fake to me though, but i know that i shouldn't judge people. my phone is ringing and i am almost done. alright i am done. later.

"i have never had to write like this for a class before, but i believe that i have done something similar to this on paper -- like in a journal or something. i'm not sure what i am going to write about for twenty minutes, but i guess it will not be that hard. there's a really cool song on channel 15 right now -- i heard it while i was doing my hoomework last night. it's like a live version of a song by portishead. i think i'll go out and get the cd. when i have the money -- haha. this is a really cool group. i think i can get into their music. i'm a real music lover. i think there's always a song of some sort playing in my head. i can't wait to hear a lot of the live music downtown. hopefully we (my roomates and i) will go soon. music and art are really my thing, even though right now my major is biology. i'll probably end up giving in and doing what i want to do. i just don't know how i'll make it (financially). but enough about that. lets see. gosh, lake travis is so gorgeous. i really want to go back out there this weekend. it's so relaxing. i love being up here in austin. see, i'm from corpus christi - which is also a very pretty city - but it's just so flat down there. the land and everything. all we have is mesquite trees and cactus. the beach is great, but i grew up in a more rural part of south texas about 45 minutes or so from the beach. i can't imagine moving back to south texas though, not now that i've seen hills and trees. and no humidity! my hair does great here. my parents should retire around here. might be good for thier alergies. i don't think i will live in austin forever, but as far as texas goes, i think it's the only place i might live. i want to travel though. see all the places i've never seen. maybe i'll study abroad. who knows. gosh, my parents would die. see, i'm the only child. i've already had to come home like 3 times since i moved here in august. i miss them too though. a lot. i guess maybe i'm not supposed to go off on a tangent like that. i'm just suppossed to write about what thoughts come to mind. but i guess those were what came to mind. hmmm. i'm tired. yes, i hope i'm able to get more sleep tonight than i did last night. maybe i'll get motivated and get all my work done before. oh. 2 o'clock? probably not. but i'll get to sleep in friday and this weekend. i had better get motivated today. yeah, i guess after this i will begin studying and then go out for a jog. i always feel better after i excercise. and excercise is something i really need right now. there's just not enough hours in the day, you know? i'm taking 16 hours and 3 of the five courses involve a lot of reading. the other two involve a lot of ananlytical thinking -- something i don't enjoy a whole lot. well, not at all, actually. ok, times up. twenty minutes. wow -- that went by more quickly than i thought it would. and check out my huge run-on paragraph! i hate those. oh well.

"i have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here i am writing about my thoughts. i am completely amazed that i can do this assignment on the internet. i mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet. sometimes i wonder if the internet is just getting way to big. i hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself. personally i do not completely understand what they mean by that. but it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want. i guess, like most things in life, the internet has its good points and its bad points. this writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college! it is so weird that i am now a college student. i still feel like i don't completely belong here. i have met a lot of cool people, but it definately does not feel like home. for some reason i have not come to realization yet that i am here for like seven more months. i still have no idea what i want to study. my major right now is microbiology. i was planning on becoming a doctor, but i'm not completely sure. i think that is what i want to be but i am interested in so many things. i'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if i'll like that. i am good at math and science so i considered engineering. the only problem with engineering is that i really don't understand what an engineer does! i love science so i guess the medical field is good for me. lately though i have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian. it involves science and animals and i absolutely love animals. the problem with deciding on a major is that i have no clue what each major entails. i guess i will have to go and research all the different majors i have been thinking of. this past june i went to this program called national youth leadership forum on medicine in boston. i did not really want to go but i decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor. it did not really do that, but it was an interesting experience. we went to harvard medical school and talked to med students there. that was interesting because i was expecting like a bunch of einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations. actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself. also at the forum we went on hospital tours and some kids (i wasn't one of the lucky ones) got to shadow a doctor for a day. my friend harris was able to actually watch open heart surgery. she said she saw the doctors flatline the heart (i guess the do that in open heart surgery) and then revive it. i was angry about that because i really wanted to see something like that. instead, the hospital i went to, we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour. like i've never seen a hospital before! all in all the trip was fun because i at least got to see boston. i had never been on the east coast before and it was really interesting. boston is an amazing city but it is way too chaotic. i had been accepted at boston university and i did not go there because it was way too expensive, and after actually going to boston i was glad that i did not choose to go there. i mean, i love big cities and all, but boston is just way too big. i would lose myself there. so here i am at ut. i am from michigan and my final decision in a school was between ut and uofm. the only reason i came to ut was because my parents moved to dallas a few weeks ago for my dad's job so i figured i might as well come to school here too. being up in michigan with my parents down here just seemed like it was way too far. i am ready to get away but not that far away. texas is so different from michigan. it is really hard to get used to. i have never seen a state show their state flag so much. it is cool, just different. i live in michigan for 17 years and i don't even know what the state flag looks like. everyone down here is really nice though. i like that a lot. i guess it is a southern thing, because people are really eager to talk to you. i can't believe how many people i have met and i have only been here for a week. i like ut a lot and i am glad that i chose this school. i am sure that after time i will feel like a true ut student. i guess that i just need to find my niche in the college scene.

" i really do not feel homesick at the moment. today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home. in a way i do feel like i miss my mom and my dogs and dallas in general but i am having too much fun in austin. more and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually i just got sick. literally. i felt like i was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second. as soon as i started feeling that way, i realized the true comfort of home that i do miss a lot. today i ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and i really wanted my mom to be sitting there. i felt really independent which i liked, but i also felt lost. i had no support and i feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom. on another note, i am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing. i am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night. it seems crazy to me. hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds. i feel so terrible right now. i am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry. the doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode. my room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as i write this. and all of her online music is driving me up the wall. it is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper. i am about to start getting ready for bed also because i am super tired. i really don't want to go to my 8 30 class in the morning. do you know how early that is? i am not looking forward to it. i hope the class is fun. it is about fashion design which interests me but i heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects. i finally got water. i am so excited. i really like the way my room is decorated. it is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute. ow. it really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes. ouch. the doctor told me to inform her in case of that but i had not had a problem really. my forehead itches. i feel like i am complaining a lot as i am nonstop writing but i guess it has just been a really rough day. i really love ut though, i am having such a great time. it makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until i am on my deathbed. that will be funny. i bet this writing is really bad but i am just following the rules. this constant humming is really annoying me now. i have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming. oh well, i can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all. this is going ot be an awesome year. i can not wait till the time gets rolling. i really feel like brushing my teeth. i can still taste my frosted flakes. gross. i have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night. i always forget little but important things like that. i also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out. my skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes. it kind of weird like that. well my time is almost up. i feel like even though i am thinking about things, i can not really decifer what i am hearing inside my head. it is kind of weird. my room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student i am, i am trying to resist laughing. well, i am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night.

"i can't believe i am doing this, and that i actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that i have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least i think that is what you call it. to tell you the truth it is actually easier than i thought it would be, i expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. but i guess i am coping with it and handling it the best i can. though i am always afraid that i will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. actually, that is a true nightmare that i have had before. which reminds me that i have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. which i guess is because i have just moved here from a really small town. and when i say small, i mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. now compared to that austin is a real shocker. i guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. so many things are different and yet so many things are the same. a funny thing happened when i first moved here a week ago, i found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. just think of how many apartment buildings there are in austin, and i unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. and she and i only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other, i am already looking forward to the christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. i am so tired of this ninety degree weather. i can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. but i guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. that reminds me that i have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because i am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and i want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. more than likely it won't rain, but i know that if i don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. i don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually i don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so i finally told him that we would come watch him this friday. he's supposed to be really good. but i don't even remember what position he plays anymore. the reason that i don't really like football is that i don't understand the rules very well, and i think that if i knew them better then i would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. i am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. i like to do more calm, less active things. one of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. i wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. i wonder how long that marriage will last. but i am glad to be going to her wedding, because i will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. i haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. well, i am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so i must end here.

"its been 2 weeks now that i have been in college. i havent made that many new friends, but at least i have been trying. i go and meet new people, peobably most of whom i will never meet again, but it's fun still to just go and meet people. i look at my friends from high school, and they just sit around with each other. to me, they don't seem to be getting the new life experience, high school all over again. i think college will be a great time to see new things in my life. maybe figure out what i want to be as a person. as far as girls, there are many on the campus, but i don't know how many i have a chance with. sometimes, i feel like my religion holds me back, but i know its something that i want to keep. its like a respect factor. i hope the girl is out there. i do regret sometimes when i know i should go talk to girl, but instead i just go somewhere else. im not that shy, but i feel girls always think they're being hit on. the better thing to do is to go for it anyway, and who cares what they think. the things that happen during this time in our life, i wonder if this stuff really even matters that much. i mean how much is this stuff really going to affect me later on, or should i even bother with all this stuff. people tell me that it does matter and its all part of life, but i don't really know. i think sometimes i think to much about what other people are thinking. like act differently towards different people, which something i don't like doing. also, i think i judge too quickly. i finally opened the door to the my dorm yesterday; stupidly i didnt do so before. i met some people, they seemed pretty nice. i want to meet some girls though, so if nothing else, my confidence will be boosted up. i usually not really needing self-assurance, but what can i say, it is a bit different here. as far as jennifer goes, well im trying to be friends with her. i think i can be, it doesnt really matter anymore. i think she finally realizes it as well. in life, i think we all make many friends, so it doesnt really matter that much i guess. also, i noticed when i make a point i think about the opposite as well. like maybe i should try to stay friends with her, what if she turns out to be a life long friend. i like it when im just in a relaxed mood, when stuff doesnt bother me. just chilling and not worrying about anything. school hasnt been that bad so far; i know i need to pick it up. studying hard right now will pay off for me a lot. i guess writing in a journal does help. it makes me feel releaved of some emotions. i want to go to that party tonight, but i don't know how i will get there. psychology class should be fun, i like the material we are covering, hope it's not too hard though. im worried about calculus, that class is going to be tough. sheena, well i don't know about her. she's cool, but i don't know. she's really hesistant, and i don't really trust her. seems like she's really good friends with a lot of people. i mean i want to make some new friends, meet some nice girls, and make good grades. simple goals. this 20 minute segment is really long. im getting tired of writing. i want to go club tonight, i hope i can get a ride up there. i have study too, so if i don't i can always just study. all the same.

"the first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. they are ages 4 and 7. i can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. they live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. i feel bad saying this, but it is true. she is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. when i used to live with her i took advantage of this. i made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and i did not take care of myself. thank god i got out of that situation. i moved in with my father and my former stepmother. they got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them i would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. even after my dad and stepmom got divorced i still lived with her, i am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. getting back to my sisters, i am afraid that they will fall into the same habits i did and they are not as lucky as i was to have my stepmom. i can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. i hope that i can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because i only get to see them about once a month. they are beautiful children with great personalities. unfortunately regina the 7 year old has already had troubles in school. i know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. andrea the 4 year old is absolutely brilliant, i don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern i did of lying and not doing her school work. i would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because i am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. i cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. i know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and i love my mother very much also, but i just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. it would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that.

"ever since i came to the university of texas i have been thinking about playing soccer. i turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. i wanted to come here because i know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. after going to the football game i could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 80,000 people. i can picture myself right now dribbling 5 players and scoring a magnificent goal. every one around me would be cheering like crazy and i would be the big man on campus. right now, i am wondering if i have made the right decision whether or not i should have come here. not only did i do very well in soccer, but i also got very good grades in high school. so, i made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. as of now i am glad with the decision i have made. i am having a blast over here. especially your class. it is the best. my class consists of about 540 people. that is a huge number. that was the size of my high school class in jersey village. in my psychology class right now i have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom i like. i am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if i kissed her. i am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. i know they must be very lonely. i just hope that their health remains in very good condition. i already told them that they have to live to be at least 80 years old. in high school towards the end i started to slack off. i told my parents that i would get very good grades so i have to study a lot this year. i am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. my sister is going to texas a&m and is majoring in psychology. if i ever need help or anything i can always call her. she is a junior right now. ever since i got here, i have been missing my cat very much. i have a picture of him next to my bed so i can see him every now and then. i can't wait to go home for the weekend. thanks!

"i don't understand how it is i'm supposed to write this thing when i can't even type as fast as i can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think. at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller. i have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right? it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. i hate when people call me smart because i don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really don't. i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them. they were so bluh. i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never i'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. i think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month i had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. i didn't even realize i had talked that much on the thing. now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can i cuss on this thing. i don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree i'm not and early i did say i wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. i wonder if i can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i can't speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it. and i normally understand it too. but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor. i want to be a teacher too but i'm afraid because i'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal i dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. i think i'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem. but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer. i am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. i don't even clean as often as i used to. i just want to be lazy and go out. i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict. i never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which i did. but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. i'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but i'm not about to complain anymore because i'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes. i want to keep writing but i'm supposed to do my pre-cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i don't have.

"i feel that i have so much to do in the next few days. college is so overrated. the few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time, or do whatever it is that you like doing, equal all the other times you are reading, reading, studying, or doing other school stuff. i had a french vanilla cappuccino at like 9:30 tonight and it gave me so much energy that i can't sit and focus on one thing. it seems that i have been procrastinating all night. oooh all that i need is you (so the song i am listening to right now) but anyways. now i don't remember what i was thinking about a moment ago. it must be that caffeine i'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 48 hours. o no. i'm not really sure what i just did. i hit tab because that's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead. so instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 20 minutes i think it was more like 2 so now i'm thinking about how i need to get in contact with the ta or the professor and explain how i will probably have two submissions but i'm not really sure because i don't know how computers work. they are so complex. i don't really understand them. like earlier i couldn't log into the prescreening experimental stuff. i have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because i don't really trust them. i'm very skeptical of them. i feel like if i start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it. like just now, i'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise. the song i'm listening to is sung by a different group, but the same song i did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing. during a heavy practice time i had mono i remember. kind of a cool time because i got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasn't fun but i did get to know my teachers well that year. i wonder how the other two girls that i did the trio with are doing. they are both a year older than me so they've been doing this whole college thing longer. speaking of long i just looked at the time and i've only been doing this for like five minutes. looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever i made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didn't. i actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend. she is a choreographer for a dance team i was interested in trying out for, but i decided not too because it brought back to many memories. i am thinking about trying out for steel dance this weekend but i don't know yet. o yaw that reminds me that i need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because i really don't want to wear pink tights and a black leotard. it makes me feel fat. which reminds me i never ate dinner tonight and its like 110. i guess all the julius chips and salsa i ate will have to do. thank goodness for julio. he makes some awesome chips. i wonder who julio is. or even if julio is still alive. my roommate brought his chips back from del rio. my hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories. i think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so i definitely will remember that one. o look more remember things. i guess the hippo thing is working right now. the song i'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team. rachel and shea. they were awesome dancers. i wonder where they are now. there is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks. actually shea has a pair of my comfy pants that i loved that my friend brittney had on tonight. shea is in utah so i don't think i will ever see them again. speaking of comfy clothes i wonder why all i wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt. it must be that whole college thing. o no. here goes again. that whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when i didn't even click on the program. this computer is so random. maybe i just need to update the aim program. but then again i don't know that much about computers so i'm not really sure how i'd go about doing that. with my luck i'd probably download some computer virus with it too. and viruses. that thing about getting sick when you are most stressed. i will probably be getting sick soon because i am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project. which didn't go exactly how i hoped but its over so i don't want to think about it. if i say i am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick? that is something else we learned about. if you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it. o man i don't remember the name of it. i am really going to have to study for this test. i should probably start this weekend. well there is one more thing to add to my to do list. i started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer. i need to add that i need to talk to a ta for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before i forget. my 20 minutes is up now its a good thing i ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing i will remember. now i really like this song. its from 13 going on 30 that movie. i have started watching more movies since i got to college i think that is what i will ask for for my birthday-movies. o yaw my time is up. i need to get ready for bed so maybe i will get a decent amount of sleep tonight.

"as i write my first writing assignment, i can't help but notice the time: 5:55pm. as usual, my radio is on. it only takes away the silence in my apartment. blank. my head is blank. empty. with nothing to say or write about. this has never been a problem before. in high school, there was never silence. maybe i was always too busy to hear the silence. now, it's a part of my life. at certain times last year, i could hear it. weird, seeing how it was my freshman year in college. this year is my second year and i seem to hear nothing but silence. i am still involved in the same activities as last year. perhaps, it's a sign that i'm finally growing up. another weird concept. i am thinking that i like silence. deep down, i do believe that i am a loner. in high school, who would have thought? a loner should be lonely, right? but i am not lonely nor am i ever bored. i like to do things by myself. i think that's it. i don't need anyone. i don't need companionship nor do i need to be felt needed. awww. to much of the word, ""need"". no more. i am happy. i am content. i am selfassured. i told my mom once that i was a loner, but i can't remember what she said. i don't think she even responded to me. funny thing though. i know i want to be married someday. now, how would a loner accomplish something like that? i socialize very little these days. my mind is always on school and my studies. i just want that medical acceptance letter in my hands. that is all that counts. well, not all. my family counts too. they mean more to me than anything. my little brother is here at ut.

"the following has been transcribed from paper exactly as it was written (including all mistakes, misspells, etc): let's see. its really hard to do this assignment because i find i have trouble doing this assignment i messed up there. it's hard to write down your own thoughts because i find that even as i am writing this i am already thinking something else. it's hard to get into the right mindset because as i'm writing this i feel like okay. i'm writing a paper for psychology, not i'm writing down my thoughts. what i was going to say above before i messed up was that i can't or rather, i'm having a hard time with this assignment because i can't, i mean i have trouble doing something on cue or when someone tells me to do something. it's difficult to do something that usually comes naturally when someone gives you certain perameters to do it in. its like someone telling you to go the bathroom when you don't have to. or its kind of like when some one tells you ""don't think of an elephant"" what's the first thing you think of? in this assignment, its like you're telling us, ""don't think of it as writing a paper for a psychology"" or was that the whole point?--to see if we could write down our thoughts freely and as they come to us without--oh @#&*! i lost my words or i don't know how to word what i was thinking rather. i find that this happens to me often. i really don't feel like i'm writing down my thoughts, i feel more like i writing an entry in a diary or journal. hmmm. i wonder when my friend christine is going to call, i hope soon because i need to get the store before it closes--todays sunday so everything closes early. i hate waiting for phone calls because i hate that feeling of not knowing when they are going to call. you expect the phone to ring any minute but at the same time not to. it just happed again--in the middle of the previous sentence i had to pause because i wasn't quite sure how to word myself. sometimes you have feelings that cannot be expressed in words (at least for someone like myself--i'm no shakespeare). i'm writing this down on paper & i'm going to type it later. i've just had to switch to--oh never mind-that really wasn't what i was thinking. i really wish this stupid cold would go away. i keep sniffling every 5 seconds and coughing too. times almost up--1 more minute. i can't think now with that in mind. so i'll end here.

"i'm sitting here thinking that it's rather nice that the ethernet in my dorm is finally up, although i feel bad that my roommate is still having problems with her computer. she has an ibm aptiva and it seems that the wireless ethernet card just doesn't agree with her system. i staring at my philosophy book in front of me, and i think that drug legalization is an interesting subject. i've never considered drug legalization before. i always thought that drugs were bad and that was the final end to the case. however, all these philosophers (who aren't all that old and ancient) think that legalizing drugs might be a good idea. not that they want to promote drug use and make it easy to obtain for everyone, but legalized in a restricted fashion like cigarettes and alcohol. i also need to write some letters to my friends and stuff back home after this assignment since i haven't talked to them in such a long time. i can't decide which sort of stationary to use since i collect stationary and stickers, so there is a wide variety to choose from. i miss them greatly since i don't have as many friends in austin as i do back in houston. i haven't been here long enough. there are my roommates, though. as a matter of fact, i'm curious about whom my roommate is calling right now since he seems like a close friend. she's talking about food since she didn't get any before she came back, and that makes my stomach respond slightly. i only had 3 slices of pizza for dinner, and that apparently isn't enough since my stomach rumbled when my roommate mentioned food. she also asked me if a friend of ours was 21 or not, but i don't know. he's a nice guy since he helped me with my phone jack. i couldn't plug in my phone since the jack had been painted over to the point where the wires can't even register each other. i think i'm running out of things to say since i can't imagine what else might be of interest to occupy my mind. i've nothing to look forward to this evening except reading assignments from all of my classes. i realize that reading is essential to the learning process, but all these long chapters are tedious. there isn't too much of great interest in reading these heavy textbooks. i wish we had textbooks like they do in japan. their textbooks are really small and light so they don't get backaches and have to lug around huge backpacks. perhaps people in america will slowly grow shorter since the weight of backpacks stunts the growth of young people in this country while japanese children grow taller with the freedom of light backpacks. it would also be nice if international music from japan and other countries would be more accessible here. it's hard to find japanese popular music in texas. you have to either order them off the internet, or look for the small stores that specialize in importing these types of cds. it is rather expensive, too, but it is kind of ironic that japanese cds also cost about $30 in american dollars in japan. cds are cheapest in taiwan since they only cost about $5$10american dollars there. it would be nice if i could visit taiwan often, but i don't have the time and plane tickets cost more money than i have to spend on leisure travel in a year. i think that is a pity since i would like to see my uncle and my grandmother more often. and the fruits in taiwan are of a much greater variety and sweetness. the same type of fruit here is much smaller in size and a great deal more expensive. they don't taste the same either. i think my dad misses taiwan the most, although he has made many friends in houston. i miss having chinese food every night, too. it feels weird not using chopsticks for two weeks in a row. i have to remember to bring some the next time i went back to houston. i really miss my dad's cooking. he cooks really well. and he knows where all the good chinese restaurants are. it's hard for me to order food myself since i don't know the names of the dishes. the names i do know are in chinese, so sometimes i pronounce them wrong and the waitress gives me this funny look. i think the food i like best at this particular time is vietnamese noodles, dim sum, and this chicken steak with rice. i think i can get vietnamese noodles here, but dim sum is something best eaten in a big city because it's a specialty that only some cooks can get right. i am not sure about the last one since i am unfamiliar with the chinese restaurants around campus. it is something i may do during the weekend, exploring the nearby food places to see what is good to eat around here. i really talk about food a lot when i'm hungry, it seems. there isn't much in my room's refrigerator since i haven't gotten anything as of late, and it would be rude to eat everything that my roommates bought. i shall have to go to the store in the morning or after school to obtain some snacks for when i am hungry like i am now. the cafeteria here closes at 7 pm so i can't do anything about being hungry at the moment. i have a screen mate program that creates little lambs to wander around my computer screen. there are five of them wandering around right now, and one of them just sneezed. i think it is funny since i just sneezed recently. these lambs are very adorable, and they don't take up much computer space. they sleep and jump around, basically entertaining me while i'm doing my homework or just when i'm surfing around the internet. i love being connected to the internet at all times since all of my classes post important information on the web, and because i like to do personal research of my own into the subjects and hobbies i cultivate. it is also good for multiplayer games, but there seems to be a firewall in my dorm network that prevents me from hosting such games. it aggravates me greatly, but at least i can participate with a steady connection unlike when i used to use aol.

"last saturday, my parents sold the house that i have lived in my entire life. even though it has been on the market for over a year, i was very upset. it seems to me as though my family is falling apart. i have three siblings, and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities. and since the place that my parents are moving to doesn't have rooms for us, where i am right now is my home now. where my brothers and sister live is their home now, and it doesn't feel like we are a family anymore. because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically. even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown, amarillo, we couldn't. there are six of us in my family, and my parents only have one extra bedroom. my sister only has one extra bedroom, so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent's when we are in amarillo. it's so weird. i don't even know what i'm going to do when i drive past the house. i'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking. i do things like that all the time. without thinking, one day, i drove to my best friend's house because i was thinking of her, and she wasn't even in town. i just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want. they are so excited about simplifying their lives, but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof. my family is the most important thing in my life, and i don't want that to change. i guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings. they were close friends with their siblings, and now they barely talk to each other. now that my siblings and i are beginning to make families of our own, i don't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now. i've gone through life making friends and growing apart, and it has been really hard on me, but my family has always been there. without that solid relationship, i don't know how life is going to be.

"well its after classes on this friday. i am sll freaking' stressed out. stupid fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. it's not that i don't know how to do it, it's just that i doubted myself. i don't know, ever since i have been here i think that i have gotten dumber, when in reality i am not. i am actually pretty damn smart. i am just letting what everyone says get to my head. so it pretty much is my fault anyway. well from now on, i am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like i am smarter than the professor that made them. i probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. damn i miss my girlfriend. she is like so freaking hot. yeah i know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and i wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. she is more mature than most of the girls i have for classes and some of my close girl friends. damn i am sneezing well i am doing this in a friends room so yeah. well jessica is hot and i miss her. its not really a distraction. today i was tired i have no idea why i have been sleeping more than i ever have. i don't even read for classes. college isn't even hard. i could not read and make a c in all my classes but i want a's damnit. stupid medical school. wish i could fast forward my life about 8 years. but i'll be a pinche viejo by then. i wonder if because i am cussing the person that reads this will think i am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality i probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. and its not like i am a big cusser. its just i have been so damn stressed lately. i was doing my chemistry homework and i ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. not like one or two try like 10 to 20 strands of hair. um. went blank. nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than i can type them out. this keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. well, here i am in college. everyone once in a while it sets in. they are a lot of hot girls here. i really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because i am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. i have been in love before. went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. four damn years. my feet stink and its driving me nuts. its like i can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. i wonder if other people have that problem. i am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. its probably all the bacteria on my feet. o well. tonight i think i am going to get drunk. i have never drank before, well i have taken some sips like four. beer tastes like shit. i am just going to drink ""chick"" drinks. i don't care what guys say. and if i do something stupid tonight o well, i need to wind down. i have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. o well. sucks to be in college. you know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. in fact i would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. i know i could do that but i don't know i guess i don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. i don't think i like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. i don't like to leave things to chance. but then life has screwed me over so many times before even when i was doing all the right things so what was the point. i mean i didn't drink or do drugs i mean i tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. i love god i would go to church and like it, i would have my quiet time, i would be a pretty good christian example till like my jr. year and what happened?

"" you can call me old-fashioned but i believe in abstinence. i am a virgin. it bugs others, but it doesn't bug me. i don't get how people can make love to multiple girls and not feel dirty about it. i know i would. i would never have sex with my girlfriend before we get married. i want to have that respect for her and just restrain myself from that. i mean, don't get me wrong, i love her. i want to make love to her, but i am not going to. i have morals. i was raised in a culture where dating was frowned upon. my parents had no problems with it as long as i didn't do anything - and i don't. i really like this girl, and i have thought of a future with her in the long run and i do not want to compromise that. i just wish that she would be here with me. as you can see, she means a lot to me and she is on my mind a lot. my major is psychology, but eventually i want to become a pediatrician or maybe even a psychiatrist - i don't know yet. it worries me that i will have to stay in school for another 8 years and that is a real long time but i feel that it is worth it, so i do not want to give up. i will try my best. now i am sitting here not knowing how to word this paper because i am so accustomed to high school writing with 5 paragraphs and an introductory and conclusion, but the assignment was to simply state my feelings - so i am. it is raining outside right now. i hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because i have classes. it would not be fun walking drenched to philosophy 301 with professor bonevac. philosophy also seems like an interesting class for me. professor bonevac is hilarious and is awesome to listen to (as you are). the rats with altered hypothalamuses were hilarious and they really made me think about all the technology that is out there. i know i am doing the right thing by taking all the classes i am to pursue my career. i am scared that my grades won't be able to cut it though. all these classes require a lot of reading, and reading isn't exactly my best subject. i am trying my best to keep up and continue with all the reading and continue with turning in my assignments on time. it is really hard but i think i should be all right. i am especially worried about this class, because the lectures are completely different from the textbook and i have to keep up on both and well - i am just a confused little man. my times running out and my brain is struggling to squeeze words out to finish up this assignment. i also have a chemistry exam tomorrow. yes tomorrow. so hopefully i'll do good at that because it seems relatively easy. i miss my parents. they are back in houston. they don't want me to go visit them because they don't want me adding mileage to the car. so i am stuck in austin til thanksgiving. i'll go home, eat turkey, and come back sick. yes, i do listen in class.

"well it's 13 min. into my writing and somehow i erased everything that i had. sorry. anyhow where was i. i wonder if i should stop hanging around with sisters this semester. that would be really hard i don't think i could do it. i need to be around them. i wonder who i like the most right now. is it abby? yobel? still caroline? i wonder if abby would ever hang out with me like one on one. i'm pretty sure yobel would, but she's so young. it doesn't matter to me really but to other people it's such a big deal. i wish all that stuff i had written hadn't of disappeared. what did i do to make that happen? now the reader's going to think i was goofing off while i should've been writing and made the whole disappearing thing up. i wonder if it'll let me go on for more that 20 minutes. why would it have a fishish button if you were supposed to write for the entire 20 minutes. do some people write shorter. i want to find out but i don't want to push the button cause i may not be able to go back. i wish i had't burned my tongue yesterday. i hate it when i burn my tongue. i wonder where yobel is. i'm starting to get if for her i'm afraid. and when i get it i get it bad. can't i just go one semester without liking somebody? time's almost up. well i guess i'll contunue writing a little longer since my first part got erased. how did yobel's legs get so muscular. they're awesome. i like the way they make her walk. i wonder if i should've sat by her on the bus today. we could've talked for twice as long. i'm glad i waited for her afer i got off the bus. it probably hinted to her that i like her though. nobody else knows that. should i keep it that way. can i keep it that way? i hope so. it was horrible last semester with caroline. everybody knew. i hate that. i got to keep this one in my head. in my heart. maybe i can teach her volleyball and she could teach me soccer. she seemed pretty impressed when i told her about my volleyball class. i wonder if she likes me. maybe she thinks i'm too old. i don't look old though. i bet peter hogan looks older than me, and he's just a year older than yobel. if anything happens that wouldn't be too much of a problem. i wonder hwere peter hongan is now. why did he disappenar after he got his breakfast? well if i'm not going bowling i guess i can spend money on breakfast. i wonder who will be there in the cba . i wonder if yobel is there right now. i guess i swing by and see. i'm sure i'll see somebody there anyhow ",0,"[-0.531519, 1.881655, -0.854371, 1.616325, 1.594385, -1.372421, -1.107123, -1.593301, -0.633672, -0.548793, -0.24177, 1.111646, -0.008724, -0.304908, -1.363217, 0.0, -0.04277, 2.360999, 1.528691, -0.489657, 1.481027, -0.445212, 1.078255, -0.537944, -0.624052, -1.288369, -0.663866, 0.387308, -1.168514, -0.814305, 0.251807, -0.550551, -0.796957, -0.372897, -0.293011, -1.109326, 1.389381, -0.355896, 0.928697, 2.322578, 0.419011, 2.21419, -1.123852, -1.220848, 0.218024, -0.862924, -1.093488, -0.190111, -1.26649, 0.80441, -0.701641, 0.020497, 1.174244, 0.084871, 0.203039, 0.738246, -0.050179, 0.675281, -1.660028, 0.339869, 0.29261, -1.213537, -0.480161, -0.745201, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 1.002913, -1.179641, -0.073676, -0.23436, 1.867961, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, 1.634262, -0.451544, -0.408772, 0.65216, 4.87769, 3.624048, 5.139251, 5.142478, 4.79283]"

"""today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what i remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. back then, i was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. but now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. i don't know what it was that did it. perhaps it was that one acid trip that i took at last year's phish concert. man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. makes you feel selfcritical. i don't know how i feel now. ever since this year began, i've been a little more tired than usual. but, i've been a little stressed out, too. not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. enjoyable, too. having sex with that girl sue was a bad move, though. first of all, she's kind of nuts. i know she's lonely, too. must be tough coming all the way from california here, but at least her family's from texas. she's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. it's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world i think. i mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. all those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. personally, i think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, i'm not an old man nor do i have a family to support. i hope this girl doesn't get racked up. i'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. and, i know that if i'd gotten some loving in the last three years i wouldn't have done it. i used her and i feel rotten for it. but, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, i fear. somehow, she identifies these two things with me. don't really know why, because i never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but i never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. man, i hate complaining, but i got to say that i've had some bad luck with women these last few times. first there was lexi. i'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but i'm sure i loved her in some way. can't speak from her end of the line, though. the problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, i was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. that's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can i say? i haven't really gotten that far yet, though lord knows i've tried. i was thinking the other day about whether or not i fear women overall. well, i sure like to talk and think about them a lot. my mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. i know she loved me a lot, although i hate to admit it, and i guess that's why she was. or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. anyway, nonetheless, i've been afraid of her forever and i'm ashamed because i think it fucks up my deal with other women and i really have a hard time deciding if i love her or not. i know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do i really? of course i do on some level, but, man, i always get all tearyeyed when i even start thinking about it. that's another thing: i haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. oh well, c'est la vie. my friend elizabeth comes to mind now. i wonder how she's doing up there in ny. we have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when i learned that she liked matt for a long time. guess i always had a little something for her. that was a great time up at the doubletree last christmas, though, i will say. mr. a footing the entire bill, too. i guess townes van zandt does have it right when he said, ""we all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" last night, i learned about some of manny's holes concerning his father. he sure has been acting differently lately, though. it must be tough, but i don't know how to handle it. maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. i kind of liked that emily girl i met last night as well. i guess that statistic that says that men think about sex'women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. or, maybe i just have some complex or something. probably a combo of the two. i don't know what to think about god these days. i sure have been praying a lot to him lately, though, over this sue pregnancy thing. god, i hope that works out for me. i know it's selfish, but, man, you've got to understand. i truly am sorry, and i'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. lord, hear my prayer. amen. our society's kind of funny these days. if there is a man upstairs, i hope he's having a good time. it's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. after high school, i mean. sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman i'm sure. i wonder who's got it worse. ""sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" it just so happens i'm tired of being a man, says octavio paz. i guess we all feel like that sometimes. well, i guess my 20 minutes is up, but i do like this. maybe we'll talk again sometime. see you, man. take care and good luck.

"i just got done watching ""first time felon"" staring omar epps. i was very moving. i'm cooking stew right now on the stove. i learned how to cook it from my father. he taught me how this summer. earlier today, i did this writing assignment and after completing it, i pressed clear instead of submit. that sure got me upset. anyway, i went to class today and the lecture was funny. the phone is ringing right now. the phone is still ringing. there, someone finally picked up the phone. i have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. and in two weeks i'll start having my first set of tests. they all fall on me at once. when i think about it, i don't want to study. but thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. i kind of enjoy it. it was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. i remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. that was a really nice view. i wonder how the stew is doing. hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. i see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. i really miss him. he was like a brother to me. we always looked out for each other. i'm really good friends with his brother too. he is a good church-going person. faithfully believes in god. well, i haven't talked to either of them for some time now. maybe i'll give him a call tomorrow if i have time. my girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. it was just a message. i really miss her. she is back in houston. her birthday is coming up on the 26th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. the problem is that i have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. i wish i could take the tests some other time. oh, well. that's life for you. my brother landed an internship with ibm, but hasn't started work yet. i wonder when he will start. his future looks bright for him. i can hear the t. v. downstairs. some cartoon show is playing right now. my roommates are downstairs watching it. i can see my keys from where i'm sitting. they are attached to the pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. actually i have two key chains. the other one is of jesus. a total stranger gave it to me one day and i've never seen him since. i like to think that it was jesus himself, giving me strength when i needed it the most last year. i was feeling down and out last year. i was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. he walks up to me and gives me the key chain. he tells me that jesus will never turn his back on me. so every time i look at the key chain, i think of him and it gives me strength. school is finally underway now. i hope that i do good this year. anyway, the 20 mins are up. hopefully i'm doing this right. i know that this isn't even for a grade, but i just worry a lot. speaking about worrying, i'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because i've been calling back to houston everyday.

"well, after reading the assignment i began to wonder how on earth i could track my thoughts and feelings in my mind. i mean, does the professor want some sort of biological explanation? because i just got through about half of chapter 2 and the whole neural process. my dendrites are busy sending neurons through my axon every supermillisecond, right? then again, i'm sure those thought processes do not include all my feelings because i do think a lot. for example, now i am debating whether i should go to dinner or not, but i can't leave in the middle of this assignment so i guess i'm going to wait about 15 more minutes. to track my mind. let's see, most of my thoughts come pretty random (at least they do to everyone around me when i think aloud) and. uh oh, my roommate is talking pretty loud to me, influencing my thought process. not that i have an attention disorder, it was just a slight distraction like the music that's playing in my dorm room right now. i wonder how long it would take to read about 500 students' thought processeswould that start to influence your own? for some reason, every time i start hanging around a new crowd of people every few years, i start thinking like them. is that an aspect of societal'cultural influence, or does it happen to everyone? thinking is something that occurs all the time. for example, even when i want to stop thinking and go to sleep at night, thoughts just keep wandering in. i guess it usually comes from my visual observations during the day and the little things spark new thoughts that occur either right then or much later in the day. oh, i just remembered i should probably save this page before anything happens to it but would that take up time in my writing process? oh well, only a few more minutes left and then i save. i guess i'm kind of stumped as to what i should keep writing. i'm trying to explain how i think and how much i think, but the words are hard to come by. this happens a lot, though. whenever i understand something in my head, it's hard to explain it by mouth. some people have absolutely no problem changing these chemical messages into physical sounds, but i can totally blank on words that i say everyday sometimes. i think pretty fast, though, so maybe the time it takes to transfer from my head to my mouth is just slower? i guess since i'm writing this for a psychology class, psychological thoughts come to my head. i have a whole bunch of questions, and i usually make up my own answers to explain them but i usually find out my explanations are incorrect. right now i'm not feeling too well: i have a stomachache and my throat is all dry and scratchy. so, i start assessing why this could be maybe it's the dirty air here that i've been breathing for a few weeks, maybe it's the water, or could it have come from my roommate who has a cold? but my stomach hurts, too. is it the dorm food that is causing it? is it the heat outside that is so unbearable? i wonder if it is from stomach acidity or stress? nowadays i cannot tell if my bad health occurs from stress or from real factors. will i ever find a cure to keep myself healthy at all times? is there any way to be rid of stress? there are so many questions, but probably only one right answer. who knows that answer? when will i find out? when will these 20 minutes be up? i wonder what other people are writing about. what do you think about through another person's eyes? i think i should stop asking questions and start explaining more about my thoughts and feelings but aren't my questions an explanation in itself? i think its interesting that psychology covers biology, because wouldn't that mean there is something permanent about your personality in your brain? the question of nature vs. nurture has always interested me. i've always wondered if its both part nature and part nurture that influences the way we think. does anyone think as much as me?

"hi my name is brandi and i am writing this assignment, mainly cuz you told me too. right now i am really tired and worried about my grandfather who happens to be in the hospital right now. i feel stupid writing about absolutely nothing just what i think about and since that is what i was thinking that is what i typed. i am really wondering when this line is going to end cuz it is pretty darn long. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing at the university of atm right now. i wonder if he misses me or forgot about me. though i know that he didn't forget about me. i mean who would i am an unforgettable person. this apartment'dorm is so terribly hot. i haven't figured out how to work the air conditioner yet. i believe that it is broke, my room mate can't figure it out either. let's see i have wrote for about 5 whole minutes so far, and this is a lot harder than it sounds. let's see what can i do this weekend. hummmm. there is the football game, a party i was invited too, go home (which i don't see happening), go see my grandfather (which i am not real sure about doing), or study. i believe i will take options one, two, and four. i don't want to see my grandfather because i hate to be around sad situations. they depress me and i hate to feel sad or depressed. i figure i can make myself that way why put myself into that situation. i love my grandfather but i don't want to go there. there is also the fact that if i don't acknowledge it then it might not be true. that is the way i think. if i don't see it then it doesn't happen. illogical but it works for me. my friend just came over and i let her in she is now washing my dishes, she is one of my best friends and i have known her since kindergarten, but boy can we get on each others nerves. not kidding because we really do. we have gotten to be like sisters almost especially this past summer and we just were around each other too much. and when we argue it is usually over irrelevant things, or really really stupid things. we also argue over the race issue. she is black and i am white, that is one issue that can really tick me off. i don't understand how people can be so stupid and childish. why should we look at race instead of the people. that issue really makes me mad. i really have completely nothing to say at all. i did receive a letter well email from my boyfriend today and it really made me happy. he told me that he missed me. it had been awhile since i have seen him but hopefully he will be able to come see me this weekend on sunday since there is a stupid football game on saturday. i really miss him and wish he was coming here but it makes me happy when i hear from him and see him. i guess since i am a female one of the most lovable things i like to do is hug someone, but only at certain times. cuz when i am sad, it will make me cry in a heartbeat. kind of what happened yesterday. i told my room mate about my granddad and she gave me a hug and i wanted to just cry, but i hate to do that in front of people. lord have mercy it is hot. i am about to catch on flames i am soooooo hot. well i have typed for twenty minutes so i am leaving now. i sure am glad cause it is really hard to just wait until your mind has something to say. i mean when you aren't thinking about it you can think all day long but when you are trying to think of something to say you cant do it. never fails. happens to me every time.

"i just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason i can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. i love rugby. i was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now i can do that. i missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 7:30 pm instead of 7:30 am. i hate when i do things like that. i miss summer school at ut. it was so much more fun than the fall. everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. now i'm lucky if i see one of the people from summer just once a week. fall was suppose to be better. a girl that was my best friend in highschool, and i am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. all she cares about is her sorority. and when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was tired of dealing with it. why doesn't she quit? what is her obsession with being a part of something? i just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. instead we are moving further and further apart. every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. she always some how avoids it, and i don't know why. suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. i can't believe i just wrote that because i am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. she lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. we talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. she is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood i'm in. i guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. i never knew i thought about her as much as i do. i think i'll go and see ",1,"[0.523029, -0.678305, -0.989333, 0.23806, -0.155887, -1.333726, -0.267316, 0.182202, 0.358054, -0.658606, -0.1765, 0.164617, 0.523698, 1.673313, -0.281831, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.390489, -1.274243, 4.059686, -0.251185, -0.427907, 0.418663, 0.227023, -0.624052, -0.136035, 0.722892, 1.772559, 0.587385, 1.07184, 0.807464, -0.033483, -0.510386, 0.222325, -0.634377, 0.419261, -0.472088, 0.430124, -0.085272, -0.65471, 0.503899, 0.450165, 2.250422, -0.218605, 0.749841, 0.255624, -1.093488, 1.48185, 0.514992, 1.512018, 1.38473, 1.207016, 1.505559, -0.493255, -1.124943, 0.96133, 0.070576, -0.092039, 1.14404, 0.066215, -1.349298, 0.854527, -0.480161, 0.365173, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.07473, -0.581753, 0.321839, -0.23436, 0.140736, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, -0.708855, -0.451544, -0.408772, -0.601043, 5.01489, 3.554906, 4.780378, 4.591832, 4.825318]"

"here i go, frist off let me think of a topic, how about looking at a country side in the texas hill conutry. useraly the frist thing i notce are the ceder trees, and while i like trees, there is something upsetting about ceder trees; they are not native to this part of the country, however they are well adattined to this climet. sence ceder trees are evergeens they can feed themselfs all year round, which gives them avantivce over the trees that grow here naturaly, such as oaks and jupaters. oaks and jupaters lost thier leaves in the fall, and both species of trees grow very slowly; aposed to ceder wich grow very fast. thus the ceder trees have drowed out most of the oak and other native trees. this is upsetting to me because, while ceder forest is nice to look at, it is no where as impressive as an forest made up of old mujestic oaks and jupaters with there beatifull puple and white blossmues. another thing about ceder is they grow close together and low to the ground, which makes it very hard to walk around in a ceder woolden area. just think how great it would be to walk aroud in a forest of huge old oak trees over your head, that pervade shade, while still leting a cool wind througt. yes, it would cerncely make the rolling hills of the hill conutry more beatuifull, and would surely enhace my beatitude, while walking through the woolds.

"i really want to sleep right now. i am so overwhelmed with everything that i just want to sleep. i just need a little bit more rest but a little bit more time. time, there just ever isn't enough time. not enough time to read, to sleep, or to study. time flies. time is precious. i think that people spend too much time wasting time. i didn't realize that until lately. you think that everyone will always just be there but they aren't. time is so valuable. the time you spend with people is so precious and important. and i think that sometimes it takes losing some one through a death or some one moving away for you to realize that. i didn't. i would give anything right this second to talk to my grandma. anything. or to be able to have my best friend who is that the naval academy just give me a hug. but no i wasted a lot of time. but busy busy busy bee. maybe if i wasn't so busy and didn't get so involved i would have time. but it is so hard to say no. it is hard to not get involved. especially in college. everybody needs you! they all want you to join their organization! there are just too many and not enough time! but you know i guess if you didn't do anything and then you would have excess time you would complain about being bored and wish that you had more stuff to do during that time. so is there ever a happy medium. i thought that when i got to college i would have more time. i didn't have to be in class all day and i don't have as much going on but i was wrong. time is still the same here. so now when i am out of school i will have more time? right? why do i have the feeling that once again i will be let down and time will still be as short then? i will have more stuff to keep me busy. a job and maybe a family and then they will take up a huge amount of my time. i just need a break. i need a cruise. a trip to the greek isles. now that would never be a waste of time. that would be a great way to spend my time. i could just lie there and enjoy the scenery and just take it all in. or got to hawaii i have always wanted to go to all the different islands there. i think that would just be a blast! there are lots of things that i have always wanted to do. i have always wanted to take belly dancing lessons, be in the olympics, be able to sing like the women in the theaters, speak several other languages, sky dive, and much more. i wonder if anyone ever gets to do all the stuff that the have ""always wanted to do"" i wonder if there is enough time in a lifetime to do all of that?? i think that if you really wanted it you could. but i think that if you really want anything that you could. i don't like when people say they can't. i think that is just not a good word. maybe i am just stubborn and always like i think i can i think i can! but isn't it much better going through life being like i think i can then i can't. how would that be a way to live life? what kind of fun would you have? always thinking that it couldn't be done. i think that being optimistic is a much better way to live. that is so happy! i love it. i would much rather look on the bright side of life then be like this sucks, i hate this, i am miserable, i hate this, everyone feel sorry for me, and just be blaaaaahhhh. that just doesn't sound like a good way to live life in my opinion. but i guess that i have just always seen the sun through the clouds. just be happy and nice and care. that is all that i have ever wanted to do. i love to help. i think that is the greatest thing that you can ever do. just care about someone. does it hurt you? no does it take a lot of energy? no so i guess that i just don't understand why more people don't care, and why some many people don't care. what is the point of that? you wouldn't want anyone to not care about you, so you should care for someone else. it just makes sense to treat someone how you want to be treated. you know the golden rule. well but anyways maybe people will change maybe it will just take time. everything takes time though. but i have felt relaxed writing this. maybe i should just write out what i am thinking more often. i kind of like this. i have no idea what i just typed but my mind is clearing. maybe if my mind weren't so busy i would have more time?? that could be a good idea. i gave my self a great idea! wahoo i am excited! but this does feel nice to just get all those thoughts out. i miss having my best friends to get those thoughts out to. maybe just because my thoughts don't ever make sense to me but they could some how always just tell me what i was thinking. i mean not that they were like this is what you are thinking but more that they were like, well i can relate to that by this experience and that is when you are like yes! that is what i am talking about. that is a great feeling. when someone can help you figure out what you are thinking! wonderful! we should do more of that helping people figure out what is on their mind. maybe it just makes sense to them. kind of like the whole thing how do i know that they color blue that i see is that same color blue that you see. i mean we know that we both see blue but do i see maybe your green or vise versa. who knows? but that would be cool to know. yeah that would.

" for some reason, i have been feeling really tired lately. i have been getting plenty of sleep, but it's been hard falling asleep. it feels like there have been a million random thoughts running through my head recently. i haven't been able to understand many of them, or why i think them in the first place. sometimes, i feel like i have add. ever since i stopped smoking marijuana, my grades haven't been what i expect of myself and my motivation just has not been there for anything. my mom persistently assures me that i don't have it, but i just want to get tested so i know. before i moved off to college, i couldn't stand being at my house for more than an hour at a time. but now, i want to be there all the time, even though i can't. i know that many kids feel depressed right after they move off to college, but i don't feel like anyone is going through what i am. i never understand myself. one minute i miss my ex-girlfriend. i was the one that broke up with her, but why do i miss her so much? i went home last weekend, an i ran into her. right after i left, i understood why i broke up with her, but i am already back to thinking why i broke up with her. i don't always understand her either. sometimes i feel that it's her clinical depression that makes her that way, but other times i feel like it was always me. i remember hearing the phrase, there's someone for everyone. well if that's true, who's my someone? i hate waiting around and i just want someone that i can count on being there. i guess that's why i decided to break up with her in the first place. i never felt that i could count on her always being there for me. my dad told me that my grandfather was an alcoholic, so does that mean that there is a good chance that i will be one too? i wish things were the way they were before last summer, when i had a girlfriend and had my friends that were there for me. i understand that college is all about experiencing new things and meeting new people, but i really haven't had the urge to do either of the two. maybe this is just a phase that everyone goes through. i hope so. i have had no will to meet any new girls, which i expected the complete opposite before leaving. if i miss my home and my parents so much, then why do i never have the will to call them and just talk? why can i not just gain a little weight? no matter how much i eat, i can't gain a pound. i know these are supposed to be the best 4 years of my life, so when do i start counting? i love math and everything, but it just seems like there is something out there that i would rather be doing instead of mechanical engineering.

"wow i just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit i'm so glad i'm listening to this cd it reminds me of chris, who i miss terribly at the moment. i wonder why he didn't call me back last night well i guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. i think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though i have on socks and my slippers i guess it's just that i always get really cold in hardin house i don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. i like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and i think that's going to be a lot of fun, except i don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. i get really claustrophobic, especially when i feel like i can't breathe, kind of like when i go to sleep and i like to pull the covers up over me but i always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, i think it'll be fun but i'm not sure if i'm going to get in the whole way. i've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, i kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but i still really want to go in just for a minute to say i've done it. but leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and i don't know i'm worried because mark is a fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there i wonder why he's been telling his friends about me i really don't like that because i really don't like him and i know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that ""hmmmmmm. interesting. "" like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything i say, like i sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. i don't know i just really don't like that at all. and i think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. i think it's really funny that i've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but i just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. i still get them mixed up because i know i used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now i don't know which way is right because i can never remember if i ever actually fixed it or not. i think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. i don't know what i think about will. he's also a fiji, so if i go to foam i get to see him but i also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. i got sick of the hyphens. anyways, i think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like i'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, i'm sick of this song and i'm changing it this one is happier but back to will i just don't know what i think of him. or that. whatever. i am leaving cause i love you, i am leaving cause i don't and i'm hoping you will follow and i'm praying that you won't let me go. i want to know who sings this song, chris never told me. i still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, i really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. i miss bo. i could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like travis, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing i'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. i don't know. scratch my neck. anyways i never really knew about that but i've always liked him, 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party, i can't believe he didn't remember that at all and i thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. i love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and chris both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and i liked chris and they were fighting over me. i wonder if it was right that i brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun i can't believe i actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and i'm glad chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though i know bo really wanted him to, i'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because i would have felt bad but i didn't want him to do that around me i hate smoking so much i hope andrew quits it'll kill him i think it's so funny that leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the fiji island party, i'm glad i wasn't there because i think i would have been really embarrassed. i guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but i like not drinking, and i like feeling like i don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow i only have like 3 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but i sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song i really do love this cd i wonder if michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd, i really would love that. or maybe if chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it i loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? i don't remember. ha-ha hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but kevin's married now. i don't like how i just sounded like a bimbo there i really am smart i promise. i feel really stupid in my world lit class though because i've never taken latin and i haven't studied greek, and i don't know i just feel like i'm behind the ball here on dante's inferno. i like the book a lot but i'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression i don't want raffa to think i'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though i guess i just have to learn when to speak up, it's like i'm wow that just interrupted me and i had no idea where i was going. . i guess i just get writing and i have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. i guess that's what i have to do when i start writing a paper because instinctively i start editing myself before i even begin and then i just end up never really getting anywhere. well i'm done here. goodbye.

"it's way too cold in this room to be doing anything that requires the use of my fingers alone. it's like an icebox, but that's good since i'm so hot natured. i bet that the people who type faster write more in twenty minutes than do those who are slow typists. that's almost not fair. we don't get as much of what their mind is thinking simply because their fingers can't go as quickly as their minds. mine don't either though. i can type pretty fast, but that's because i do it so much. i'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome some day. i've played the piano for almost 11 years now, play the flute, and type constantly. yikes. but, back to the original point: this isn't exactly fair since it's, well, not the same. that's obvious. i guess nothing in science can be exactly precise. exactly precise? that's wrong. i wonder if we're supposed to fix grammatical errors and spelling errors when we're done. i should have set a timer. it's too much trouble for me to keep checking on the little clock at in the system tray. oh well. we're too lazy these days anyway. everything's being sacrificed for our own comfort and peace of mind. for example, i have a feeling that technology is a huge part of the growing number of cancer patients. a woman i know died last night. she had three children, the oldest a freshman in high school. what a tragedy. it makes you wonder if it's all worth it. is better living, happier living? is it even better in the first place? i think it's going to rain. it needs to. someone said the other day that we're in our fourth year of drought now. i wonder if the drought is due to global warming, due to the depletion of the ozone layer, due to all these ""advances. "" there it is again. we think we're making improvements when in fact we're slowly killing ourselves, or our grandchildren. my spanish teacher told us that the icebergs are melting, and someone next to me said that they are in fact melting at a rate of one foot per 15 hours (or 15 days?). that's very frightening. i don't know how thick icebergs are, but they won't be around much longer at that rate. my hands hurt now. i complain too much. i whine. :) it's a personality trait. and are these traits inherited biologically or learned? heh. all this psychology is definitely getting to me. mr. pennebaker (or dr. ?) said that we'd begin to see things from different perspectives; i didn't think it would be quite so soon. i do like the class though. i like the book. mr. myers isn't such a boring guy. he put excellent philosophic quotes and questions in with the technical aspects of what we're learning, or, rather, what he's trying to get across. i find it sad that so many people don't care about learning anything. for some, it's all about the grades. we joke in our dorm (that we so lovingly have nicknamed the virgin vault since boys aren't allowed on our floor except on weekends) that we're just here for, not our phd's, but our mrs's. i don't know who came up with that, but it's pretty cute. it's always scared me quite a bit the idea of living my life for someone else. that's a bit of a clash with my lifestyle though, considering i was the president of our church youth group for two years, but i just couldn't do it for a man here on earth. i don't mean to say that getting married is giving up yourself, but the way some girls talk (about getting their mrs's), that's all they want to do with their life. that is, to me, giving it up. what about their dreams and goals? do they have any? do i? darn phone. i can hear everything around here. it's getting on my nerves. i lived in hickville, usa (ok canton, tx, but it's no different), where there were no people. i lived in the country, where there was no noise. it got so dark, and so quiet, in my room at night, that i could hear the bugs and the dog walk by, that my eyes never adjusted and were able to see. i haven' adjusted to things here yet. i wake up at 3 in the morning for no reason at all, doze back off, and wake up again at four. it's starting to become rather annoying. normally i have no trouble sleeping. my mom and i are like that. she can sleep through anything, except her kids coming in. i thought it was neat how our class related that to our reticular formation and how it ""learns and remembers"" certain things. i don't think my reticular formation has anything to do with my waking up at odd hours. well obviously is does since it's function is to control arousal, but it doesn't ""remember"" anything that happens at the wee hours of the morning. hopefully. if so, it needs to get a touch of amnesia. just a touch. that's my time limit! ttfn ",1,"[0.410434, -1.203894, -0.041554, -1.138727, -1.175495, -1.144405, 0.507311, 0.015514, 0.532045, 0.943148, -0.20792, 0.792321, 0.137782, -1.28378, 0.622455, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.467994, -1.8808, 3.579964, -1.020335, -0.4023, -0.374185, 0.022755, -0.229802, 0.438318, 0.135129, -0.029618, -0.206484, -0.010851, -0.58447, 0.584047, -0.387578, -0.295909, -0.603141, -0.007283, 0.041676, -0.120171, 0.221969, -0.59378, 1.046582, -0.025965, 0.806937, -0.530731, -0.72248, 0.207592, -0.197753, 0.610856, 0.389629, 0.897326, 0.499368, -0.669063, -0.612221, -1.371851, -1.078075, -0.092995, 0.249275, -0.488038, -0.355626, 1.22601, -1.141517, 0.39078, -0.150266, -0.144803, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, 0.427403, 0.857674, 0.140185, 0.375684, 1.213589, -0.234672, -0.337085, 1.112181, 1.981543, 2.890469, 0.776018, 1.733969, 4.494149, 3.143512, 4.694916, 4.626514, 5.52437]"

"but i guess i'm supposed to be trying new things here in college. what's on my mind right now is the question at hand. so i would say right now i am thinking most about what's going on with me socially. i feel like i keep meeting all these girls and i know i'm never going to become more than friends with any of them. people tell me i'm too much of a nice guy and not aggressive enough when it comes to getting girlfriends. but who really knows what anyone else is thinking or what another person wants. i for one have no clue what other people want from a friend or what a girl would be looking for in me but i guess that's the mystery of life. but it sure seems weird how other people seem to have things all figured out. like my suite mate gabe, i mean he doesn't have to do anything and everyone is like i want to be your friend and girls are like please have sex with me. i have a lot of friends but its like i really want one girl to be more and i can't seem to get from being friends with a girl to more but maybe its because i haven't met the girl i want to be more than friends with, oh but that's bull shit cause i know i've met plenty of very attractive girls that i would love to get with but never have. but what can i do. it also seems like some weird forces of nature are working against me on the social thing when it comes to girls or i mean my own personal looks, cause i have had a clear of acne face for over 7 months and then right before i move to college kaboom, it hits me after i go one week without using my prescription cause i ran out. i refilled it but then again it takes awhile to work so i was going through the transitional period then finally a couple days ago i'm truly completely clear and then the next morning i wake up with this huge cold sore on my lip. the biggest monstrous blister right on my lip. that's really going to make me look good for the girls. and right now i still have this blister. i fell like i have to wait for the blister to go away before i ask any girls out like this girl i met at this foam party this weekend. i talked to her on tues. but we couldn't get together but now i think i may try to wait till this blister goes away before i try to meet with her again anyway. rrgeez, my back hurts right now, hold on a sec while i adjust my seat. there we go. i am really rambling on about the girls situation but i guess that's what's really on mind throughout most of my college days. i also have the work but that just seems like busy stuff to me. to tell the truth psychology is actually so far my favorite class. not only because there are so many hot girls there but because the actual material i think is cool, like this assignment for one. i might end up writing for way more than 20 min without realizing it. well in psyche i met this girl becky and we were walking together to jester and i just truly wonder if we ever become friends, sure we happened to meet and walked together to class one day and sit together but i somehow doubt it will happen again and that's just another example of me just becoming friends, because if i do see her again we will probably only become friends that meet maybe to study or something but i guess having a lot of good looking friends is better than no friends who are girls. back to school though i cla isn't that bad of coarse math is one of my specialties, and chem i like cause i like my professor but physics seems to be the same as high school, a boring monotone voiced professor who doesn't explain things clearly in my opinion, and i know i could get good grades if they just taught from the books cause i have the ability to learn very well but tests don't come straight from the text books do they. so that may pose as a problem, but i have a class in 20 min that i need to start heading towards so now that i've typed for 22 minutes i think ill let you go now, later.

" im sitting in my room at the towers, and i have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. however i do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. and if i had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. yet i can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the towers has to be the food. the cooks here should go down in the guiness book of world records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. and everytime i go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. as i look around my room i can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. because he eats all of my food. i went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. i havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. this fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing i am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. but every once in a while i do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences i can say that tony, the guy with whom i share a room with, is a very nice person and i believe that we will get along very well. so far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. my other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. and campbell has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. yet the one guy that i am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate joey. its not that there is hostility between us its just that i try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time i get yet he just won't seem to respond. maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. because i know when i was in high school this new guy moved in from chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents. but the more time i spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. but the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk a whole lot. and i had to remind my mom that thats how people are in chicago, and just to give them time because they are really good people.

"does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? this whole electronic assignment is very new to me and i have no clue what i should do! i'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. as i'm typing, my fingers are shaking. the whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! college is a completely different world and i honestly don't know how well i will do! do i have to capitalize my i's ? i type much faster if i don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. this 20 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 7 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in ap language. mendrop made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely wrong! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think, what am i supposed to do now? i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ?

"i really miss desiree. she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how i don't have my cell phone here with me. my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until monday and i wont get it until thursday before i leave to go to houston. i'm drawing a blank. how am i supposed to write for twenty minutes when i'm struggling to think of something to write after only two. i guess i shouldn't think so hard, should i. is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway. i'm really enjoying this psychology class. i thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it pennebaker is actually a really energetic professor. i like that. it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us. kind of reminds me of brink, my science teacher in high school. he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us. i do not know one person in cleveland high school or one person who came through chs and had brinkley that didn't like him or his approach to teaching. i miss him. i miss high school. college life is really overwhelming at times. right now i'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy. i partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone. oh nikki couldn't handle that big school. she got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there. look at little miss i'm smarter than you back in cleveland. i guess it was lonely up there on her high horse. i have to be a success and that is why i have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester. it is so important that i become somebody. i can't stress that enough. i refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves. its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so. my family is a bunch of nobodies and i hate to say that. well in an educational sense of the term. none of them went off to school in order to better themselves. but then again i can't really blame them for that. i mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance. i'm here on financial aid as it is. its not easy walking in my shoes. some people think i have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges i had to overcome to get here. it was not an easy road to tow. i been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of god. speaking of god i miss tj and trinity and tristan. i only wish that i had more time with them before they left. especially tj. he was and still is my baby. i love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me. they could have left but why him. i remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when i first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no. that was my little boy. i love him and miss him like you would never understand or maybe you would because i'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine i loved him like he was.

" i feel really stressed about school right now. i hate my rhetoric class, because she makes us turn in homework everytime we meet which is three days a week. so i am behind in my reading for a lot of other classes that i am taking. it makes me so frustrated that she doesn't seem to care that i am taking 15 hours of credit and i don't have time to read a 150 page novel in two days. i'm drinking this drink called capri sun. its ok but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. i'm really thirsty though and i don't really want to drink water. our water tastes gross too. i don't know what is in it, but everytime we put it in our refridgerator, it gets a bad taste to it. everytime my roommate talks about the water tasting bad, i think of the movie signs, and that cute little girl who said her water tastes old. atleast if aliens come to earth, we'll have water to through on them. my monitor is on the fritz. it keeps turning neon shades of red. . more like purplish pink. or something of that nature. it really makes my eyes hurt when it does that. i just hit it and it goes back to normal for a few moments. i can't figure out why its doing that except for the fact that it is old. i talked to my old friend kyle last night. he called me a cutie. why i don't know. i didn't really know how to react to a comment like that especially from him, because we had a history a long time ago, and things were never really the same. i really liked him too. it kind of unnerved me when he said those things. i just kept saying how can you say something like that to me . he is really good with mind games, so he kind of played around with my mind for a moment there. he makes me so mad, but at the same time, i like to hear that kind of stuff from him. it does make me feel pretty. i don't really know what this thing is supposed to help me do. . the whole writing in a stream of conciousness way seems hard to do. i just write what i think, but at the same time i feel like i am thinking what i want to write, just so i can write it, as confusing as that sounds. i miss my friends. they are too far away to see. some of the people who came to ut with me live on the other side of campus and they don't ever call. i felt like everyone already had friends when we got here and their old high school friends didn't matter any more. it really hurt my feelings to realize that. i honestly believed them when they said that they wanted to hang out with me when i got to school. my other friends live far away. they all have new friends too. i feel left out or behind, because i don't have a new good group of friends. i really hope that my mom is doing ok. she always says that she is, and probably just because she doesn't want me to worry. but i do. i don't like being far away from her, because i can't keep up with how she is. not that she is unhealthy all too much, but sometimes she will hurt her back, or she, like everyother human, gets sick. i pretty much think of her as a superhero. invinsible to the harm of the world. i want my mom to always be here with me. now i am older and i know that my mom isn't anything other than a normal human, and it makes me worry. anything can happen anyday to me, my mom, anyone i know. its pretty frightening, but in the same sense you have to no think about stuff like that and just live life as it comes and live life for today. i try to do that. maybe that is why i don't do my homework. i could die tomorrow and what would i have to show for it? an all nighter of reading. i hate reading. it is one of the worst things you could make me do. that and writing papers and having my peers grade me. i always feel like i am going to miss something if i am stuck reading. my mom and my sister are avid readers, but i do not share the same feelings for it. plus if ever i don't understand a word, or the reading gets boring, i stop paying attention and therefore do not understand a single word i just read. i hate it. i have to read books multiple times to understand them and then i might never get it. i honestly wish that reading and writing were obsolete. impossible and shallow i know. i mean, where would we be without that stuff? no where, i am assuming. allthough i know better than to assume! i am not really a person who enjoys school. i love to listen to my teachers tell interesting stories, screen movies and make visuals in class. all of this taking notes and reading bores me. i wish school was like my elementary year and like my leap classes where cut and paste was the prefeered way of learning. those were the days. it really stinks to be all grown up. and to think that a few years ago, that's all i wanted to be.

"i just got finished with my spanish homework and now i can think in english. i don't really care for spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language. before that i was writing email to friends of mine at other schools. it is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them. if i didn't have email i probably wouldn't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive. i just found out that one of my friend's friend is quitting school. i don't understand that. giving up an education seems ridiculous to me. gold fishes are also ridiculous. my neighbor has oh wait, had two goldfish. one of them died last night. gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish. one minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a pepsi commercial. i now have been writing for five minutes and i wish i could stop looking at the clock. i took a computer assisted english class last semester and i am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience. one of my projects last semester had to do with the tick. he is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures, or nightmares, into the inner workings of his mind, he also has antenna which are referred to as those ""things"" on the cartoon by his cohorts. my little sister likes the tick as well but i don't think she understands alot the humor in it, most of its pretty stupid i will admit. my sister just learned how to say her abc's in spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone. the way she says ""w"" is really cute. my brother just got married this past summer and i don't know what to think of his wife, she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange. but i am not really a judge of strange since i have been called that myself a time or two. actually i think everyone is called strange, or weird, at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing. like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend, when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card, or package of candy. ten minutes. it is amazing how often people look at the clock. my batteries went dead awhile back and i don't really miss it very much, granted i took my sister's mickey mouse watch every now and then, in fact i think it is my room right now, but time often feels insistent and that can be stressful. kind of like how i have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment. my calf muscles are incredibly sore and i have been complaining about them all day. my roommate said that i shouldn't complain because i was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday. well i was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much, if i had know that this was how i was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice. 15 minutes. the mtv movie awards are on tonight and i don't know if i really want to watch them or not. its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are, i get enough of that with going to school here, just kidding. i will probably watch it anyway. my neighbors are pretty cool, even the one with minus on fish. i sure hope it didn't die because she didn't feed it, or over fed it. i don't see the purpose of a goldfish, i like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish, even though that is disgusting. i just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla, but now it is bob. what ever happened to quesadilla i will never know. i guess my dad and mom just couldn't hang with a name that made no sense. well it made sense to me, because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant, and they have the best quesadillas there. 20 minutes.

"this is now the third time i am writing this paper and i am honestly pretty sick of it. the first time i wrote this, i hit a delete button and erased my entire paper. the second time, the system went down so i couldn't submit my writing. hopefully this time everything will go as planned. i don't really pay much attention usually to how thoughts enter my mind but i think i know generally how my mind works. as long as there is nothing around me stimulating my thoughts i generally think about my insecurities (i am always thinking about how things could be different if say, i were prettier, or smarter, or more outgoing, or whatever), singing a song in my head (whether it be from the radio or a commercial), or stressing myself out over a test or something. if i do see something, like a young couple walking a dog in a park for example, i first take the event for what it is. t might think to myself ""oh what a cute couple"" or ""that is a cute dog. "" as the event passes though, i tend to relate whatever i just saw to me personally. i would probably think to myself, ""i want to get a dog once i get my own apartment. "" my thoughts would quickly digress as i would think of other things i could do with my own place. i would imagine decorating the walls, planting a garden, or even in what part of the city i would want my place to be in. my point is that my thoughts rarely stay on one subject matter. i quickly move from one thing to another, forgetting about whatever it was that i was just thinking about. thoughts simply lead to other thoughts, with one small detail changing the mind track completely.

" i'm really not sure what exactly i am suppossed to write about so i thought i would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's september 11th. that morning i woke up and things didn't seem any different. i put on my i love new york shirt and went to class. truthfully, i was very dissapointed with the people here at ut and how they acted that day. people in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. the tower played american songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. it was getting in the way of our discussion. whatever!! we should have been discussing september 11!! one girl in the class said, who cares!! people die every day!! we kill people in afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!! i personally was outraged by that comment. how disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. that night i went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. we stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. it was awesome. to be standing there next to my friends, people that i loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. to hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. and then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. the whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. it was very powerful. you couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in new york who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but wanting to go in anyways. i had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. and in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. at the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. i forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. in almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. you couldn't help it. then the whole crowd sang god bless america. hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing god bless america was absolutely amazing. i knelt down where i was and said a prayer to thank god for my family and my friends and for the fact that was so blessed. i picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that i love her. my family is the most important thing in the world to me and if i lost any of them i don't know how i could even go on. when it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. it made me think about the pictures i had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. a very powerful sight. the man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in pearl harbor on december 7th. that was an amazing thought to me also. it was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great american tragedy. however, this was a tragedy but not just that. in fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. i saw a commericial that gave me the chills. it was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking american city. the voice in the background said on september 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change america forever. the screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. the same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. in the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. the voice said they succeeded. i think that is a perfect way to say what september 11 has done for america. yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in america are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. at this point in my life, i am very proud to be an american.

"what a strange assignment. why did the typing start indented? twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. it's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. what do wounded ducks look like? alright, 1% complete with this assignment. physics is really hard, but i actually understand everything fairly well. i suppose that's a plus. i wish lindsay would talk to me. i really miss her companionship. i suppose now is where you notice that i am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. i really hate to be normal. i am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. i instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. i really miss lindsay. i wish i knew what to do to get he back. i think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. i really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). it's been going out recently. alright, almost 25% complete. maybe i shouldn't track my progress. is anybody really going to read this? is this simply an experiment? maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. here comes the scary part in the music. i am listening to firebird suite. it really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. what if you started this assignment at 4:50 on friday? that would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. that would actually be ironically funny. good times. something is odd. not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. i want some natural light, i really can't stand these fluorescent lights. these buildings also are disturbing. i didn't live in the country, but i really miss the trees i had around my house. living amongst these lonely trees is strange. it's like they are put on display as something that used to be. i want to go to a school that is in the trees. i am talking a tree house. in the trees of the amazon. that would be a sweet experience. the window, right. haha, of course i open my window and see construction. great, just great. it's rather depressing. alright, more than 50% complete. this could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. might find something you don't want to find. hmm. i hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. is ate the right word there? i think it might be eaten"", who knows. i feel like i have something to do, but i really don't know what it is. it felt really good to sleep in this morning. i kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. i saw cedric benson in his escalade xlt today. that is a very nice vehicle he has. almost 75% completed. what a bunch of crazy rambling. it must suck to be the one to read all of these. i suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. is that a word? who cares? i know you don't. i am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps i should learn how to more properly type. i type pretty well i think, i just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. shadows are the only two dimensional objects. shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. so is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects? can we say that we are shadows of time? there's a predicament. what is time? that's also a predicament. that would be cool if somebody would call me right now. i really don't want to have to get up so early on saturday (7:00). oh well, can't do much about it i guess. i wonder how phoebe is doing? that thought was brought on by a song that i just heard. time is almost up. check you on the flip side. ciao.

"it's me. tying along, this is somewhat interesting, i''ll probaboly copy it onto my computer after i am done, after all, i am kind of interested in trackin gmy thoughts. when i talked with allison the other day, it helped to have i'm on instead of being on the phone. it allowed me to communicate and review what we had said to eachother. i really really really hope that we don't end up playing eachother this weekend, as i don't want to play her. i know i won't paly ehr because myu lov efor her is true. and she won't paly me either, but exactly what will transpire i'm not too sure. how far is too far for the realtionsip we're in reight now? what is the relationship we're in right now? i trhink i want intimacy, but i'm not too sure. is it abuse of eachother if we don't miss eachother tremendously? io miss her tons, but i can now ahve fun without her. i do need her, but it's less than it used to be. when she dumped me, it really hurt. i neve said that i dumped her, but i understand why she thought that. life's a dance - at least it's no longer a bitch. i wonder if i couldn't go to sleep last night because i was so excited about seeing her this weekend, or because i had just finished my exercises. how long does it take the body to calm down after exercising. i didn't sleep well, but i don't think it was due to her. i'm just stuck on what kind of intimacy should be shared this weekend. i do love her. i'm pretty convinced of that. after all, she is the most beautiful woman in the world to me. i know that my feelings for her have a lot to do with that. she has a great smile. i hope that she jumps on me when i show up. it would make me feel very special. io'll definitely be excited to se her. iknow she is looking forward to seeing me too. i kind of wonder whether it is better for me to be leaving on sunday or saturday. i don't really have much choice in the matter, but i could take a bus. i want her to come to ut. at ut the logistics would flow much smoother. i'm more than willing to dedicate my whole weekend to her. this would mean i would miss her more during the week, but it would be worth it. i have friends here, which really really helps. for example, last night i went up and worked on my spreadsheet and webpage while watching a movie with them. of course, the movie was an 80s movie, and it just reminded me of her, but it was still fun. i do love her. i love love lovee love love love love love her. love can be messy. it's okay for love to be disastorous - so long as you don't lose sight of the person you love. a lot of times i feel like i'm the only one that cares about us as a relationship. when i did that thing at dave and busters she was ready to break up. i didn't feel as if it was cause. i understand why she was mad, but i also kind of expected her to understand that i was frustrated. she says she loves me, but does she? she does things that indicate both ways. i don't think that i do things that indicate that i don't love her, but maybe i do. i wish she would tell me when i do'say things that hurt her. she really hurt me, when she said that it was better to be broken up right now. i want her to have fun. i used to be somewhat egotistical about it, but right now i just want us to fully enjoy eachothers company and miss each other enough so that it's not abuse of the relationship. maybe nothing will happen this weekend. i hope that she spends time with me after the game. i expect her to spend time saturday morning studying, which is fine. i just know that i'm not going to have anything to do. i will bring my computer, but i will only be able to work on stuff that has no deadline. if it has a deadline, then it will have to be done sunday night if it's not done over the weekend. that would stink. i come back, and i won't be able to see any of my friends because i have homework to do. i really do miss allison. i'll probably do my psy reading this week. the republic is read enough for a while, but do i want to start getting ahead? probably should. the problem with lowering our love relationship to a friendship thing is that then we will never see if our love is true. i don't want to make the worst mistake of my life, when i'm not sure of it. allison is beautiful. sure, she has some qualms about being outside in the heat, but otherwise she's ideal. except, that i do wonder sometimes if she is in love with me. we should go do some outside type stuff. she has a set prenotion that she doesn't want to go camping, when in reality it could be quite fun. my parents don't do outside stuff together. allison has swallowed the heat thing before - that says how much she loves me. it couldn't have been cold the second time at miller outdoor theater. we've kissed in the heat before. the only thing is that a lot of my romantic ideas were for outside - the waterfall (not original), galveston. romantic by its very nature means of nature - she wants someone to possibly sweep her off her feet, but i don't know if that's possible. i do love her. well, it's actually time that this 20 minutes has past. it has passed quicker than i expected it too.

" well college is something i was definetly not prepared for. in high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the university of texas, i go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. so far in the during these 2-3 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. which leaves me to consider that perhaps i should buy one of those rolling back packs. the readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting. i really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. always relying on fast food is disgusting. a person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. i have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. the peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. all they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them. my classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. i believe i can do though. i have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. i wake- up at 6:30 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. she, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 7:20 am i am off to ut. once i arrive on campus the time is 8 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. our first class doesn't begin until 10 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. by the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 5pm and i get home at 6 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. but i realize i must read a chapter for rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 12am, and once again i only get about 6 hours of sleep. this system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. i see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. i don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. this makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.

"i am feeling a little nervous right now. i just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. normally i wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. i walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. i never found it. hopefully the fact that i was not in class will go unnoticed. i had a very busy day, and every little thing i do every day i have to think about twice. i can not react on impulse here in college, because if i do i could get into trouble with people i would rather not be in trouble with. if i do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. i got my ou wristband today. i had to get up very early in order to do this. i was tired out from last night as well. i have to get up early again on thursday in order to get my actual ticket. the ou tickets are thirty five dollars. this is pretty expensive. from what i hear it is worth it though. a lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. we're going to take buses to dallas and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. it sounds like a blast. one of my friends from high school moved to dallas to go to smu for college. it will be good to see him. one of my other friends went to west point for college. i respect the guy with all my heart. i don't know how he does what he does. i got to see on labor day for the first time in like three months. that was really nice. he does not think that west point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. the beginning of college has been fun so far. i've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. i enjoy living on my own. i live with three other guys from corpus christi. they are all really cool. i enjoy private times sometimes too. it is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and i get the whole place to myself. it's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. they spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. it would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. i just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. well it has been about twenty five minutes now so i am going to check spelling and submit my work.

"must i write for 20 minutes? why? what exactly does writing as i think, called my ""stream of consciousness"" prove? i suppose magical thoughts that exploit my deepest darkest secrets will arise or something. of course they could if i really got bored because my mind does jump sporadically from idea to idea but who knows? it never stops and i can never focus on one thing for very long before i get bored. i think i have add or something because it is hard for me to focus for extended periods of time which i'm sure if that's a fault of mine or genetic or experience because of tv and how american society has raised me. american society is crap. everyone blames violence on tv as the problem with the current ""violent"" america. kids watching violent shows does not make a kid violent. rather parents not telling their kids that violent shows are fake or parents that are violent or parents that tell kids violence is ok is what makes kids violent. it's stupid to blame entertainment, of course there are some cases where the tv is too blame. we cannot simply say it never does but we also cannot say that it's the root of the problem. the problem is parents and society today. 40 years ago parents would never let kids do the things kids do nowadays. drugs, alcohol, sex and everything else has become much more liberal. lets face it, all these things sell and so now we have corporate america where only the strong survive, or get rich, whichever. how the hell can you call this country so great when there jobless, starving and homeless people everyone, including children. yeah sure for the 95% of people with jobs, even then i'm sure a good % of those people with jobs still struggle to make it. they bust their butts day in and day out to get what they can for themselves and their family yet we're experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in however many years like it matters to those people who are still unemployed or working crappy minimal wage jobs. yeah, great country america is. i'm listening to this nice piano soloist on cd on my computer as i type for this long 20 minutes and it's quite pleasant. whenever i listen to this i think about the girl who gave it to me, marie tesi. even though she's getting kind of fat, i still find her attractive. it's very unusual for me to find an asian attractive, well at least in the past. i find a lot more attractive here at ut nowadays because i think i just had a town full of ugly asians or something, who knows eh? well anyway, i was so ""in"" to her, never could get her off my mind. i think i have a problem with obsessing over people, well girls, when i like them. i've never had a girlfriend and i've never even had the courage to ask a girl out. i'm so insecure it's not even funny. i wish i could suddenly build up courage and ask a girl out or even get a little kiss or sex or something. i'm no different than any other guy and one good thing is i rarely masturbate so luckily sex doesn't drive my mind and life. i can focus on other things such as watching tv, playing video games and talking to people. i think i want to be a psychologist, the phd level, so i can do research or get paid lots of money to advise people. people and their pasts interest me a lot, it's freaking amazing what you learn about people when they actually open up to you. you hear about traumatizing experiences and good experiences and stories of best friends and family and deaths and everything else you can imagine. it's all fascinating to me, i love to hear about it and try to piece together how these experiences have made the person the way they are. it's pretty cool to also, for me because i keep being told i'm really easy to talk too. be it guys or girls, i hear the same thing. so i feel as if i have some sort of gift or something that allows people to talk to me and sometimes that's all a person needs is someone to sit there and listen to another person talk and they will feel so much better. given i don't know what to say many times but i know how to empathize and sympathize with people because i feel that i've experienced enough pain, hurts, injustices throughout my life so i'm not totally oblivious to everything. i, for the most part, understand that not everything is black and white, there is always a gray area that cannot have a simple answer. there must always be a compromise that comes from both sides or else it will be black and white and life would be boring. life is boring as it is, why make it more so? a few thrills here and there but life usually is one big long path to death. how you live your life makes who you are and how you are in the end. is there an end? well there could be but that depends on what you believe in. whether it be christianity or buddhism or hinduism or any of the ism's, you know where you're going or think you know where your going. so what about atheists?. well you simply cease to exist. isn't that a scary thought? you die and that's it, the void. you don't exist anymore. you are no longer conscious and it's like you were never alive. people remember you but you are forgotten once they die unless your a martyr or a hero or king or anything of that sort, but for the most part you are forgotten within 23 generations. and my 20 minutes is up so i'm done.

"i love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since i last wrote my entry. i have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. i had english today at 9 am and really enjoy it, i like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which i like also--more of a high school feel. it is my birthday tom. and i am not excited about it because i have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. all my friends are already talking about where to live next year and i am not sure why. they all say that things fill up so quickly. i got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, i guess i had assumed we would live together next year. college is so much money. i feel like at every corner i turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. i am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, i am doing some babysitting though. kids are my life, i do not know what i would do without them. i was thinking the other day, my dogs back in houston--do they know i am gone? it made me sad to think they have no clue if i am ok, i am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. my phone is ringing but i think i will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, i have gained a lot of weight and i can feel it, i am slower and get more tired quickly. i wonder how it will feel to 19! almost 20, i feel like just yesterday i was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times i miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but i miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. right now my friend connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. she is thumbelina, so cute. there is a vacuum going on in the background, i really need to shave my legs. and lay out. my brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, i miss him also but sometimes i wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. i want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. he already has two. i am a theta and i really like them. tonight i am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as i do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. my e mail is broken and i am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. they are so slow. now my friend has left the room, i feel like i can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and i am not hungry. i am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at acc and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, i think the tv show jerry springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. i love beanie babies, they are so cute, but i do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!! i love the summer and am sad it is almost over! my 20 minutes is up so bye bye.

"i feel bad right now because my stomach is very upset, it's been upset for the past week or two and i'm afraid to go to the doctor, but anyway, i guess that's not really that important right now right? i should really be thinking about school and the 15 hour load that i'm taking and hoping that i'll be able to pass all classes with and a or a b. my father did tell me that he would give me $100 for every a that i get and $50 for the b's. it just goes to show hoe desperate he is that he wants me to get good grades. but maybe ut is just too hard for mr this is the only chance i have, you must do good adina, you must. i should really believe in myself and hopefully finish school faster than my brother did that way my parents will be able to take a break for one year and save for daniel's tuition. we are five years apart. i wonder if karel will call me this weekend. it's been a whole week, maybe he doesn't care, maybe he just has someone else, someone better than me? how could he treat me so bad all this time and me just be here waiting for him. i should stop thinking about all this and worry about other things. i really don't know how dad's going to come up with 10,000 dollars to take out those tanks from the gasoline store. we are just too poor. and how could abuelito be so selfish and not pay those 17,000 dollars that he owes in taxes on the mineral rights. tia is really upset because she doesn't think he cares much about anything anymore. which is partially true because the oil wells weren't his anyway the were abuelita's. boy do i miss her , even though i never met my own grandmother i know that she was a very beautiful lady. my dad must have been said when they told him that welita died. he would have stayed in the air force longer but i guess things just happen right, what i mean is it, it's 2:17 i still have about 10 more minutes to write. my mind is blank , i don't know what to say, this weekend when i went home there were so many flood charity things for the people of my hometown, eagle pass, and for the people of del rio. my mom and i should give all he close that we don' t wear anymore to those people. i can't believe how high the rio rose. as we crossed the bridge on friday i noticed that the river was completely back to normal but when i saw the pictures that my dad took of the river when it was high near welito's house it looked bad. i can't' believe all that stuff was under water. how could god do this to all these people. the worst thing about it is that it landed on the poorest of them all. the poorest are the ones that have to suffer the most. i hope that one day i can be rich and that i may be able to donate a lot of my money to the poorest people of our countries. people shouldn't have to suffer in such terrible ways, well, i sure do miss mom, right now she's in san antonio because she took pappy to the doctor. i think my dad might have diabetes and he doesn't know it. my grandfather has diabetes too and you know how dad is, all his life he's always liked sweets. he has a sweet tooth, exactly like his daughter. i love sweets a lot. i really do, i always think that one day i might be the one that has diabetes and not my dad. i hope not though. but maybe if i did then i would be able to lose weight. oh well, anyway. i guess i better close this because i'm just about running out of time, although i wish i could keep writing because i kind of like just typing into keys and pressing down on them with thoughts that i have in my head. well, hope you like my confusing thoughts, or who knows, maybe you won't even read this. got to go. . :0) ",0,"[-1.59069, 0.320379, -0.897902, 0.127672, 0.026453, 0.859087, -0.496122, -0.274902, -0.862661, 0.314564, -0.100314, 0.092707, -0.333812, -0.271461, -1.172365, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.145327, -0.542859, 0.271977, -0.499517, 0.294727, 0.842691, -0.703979, -0.624052, 0.075511, -1.421882, 0.828961, 0.203895, -0.075207, 0.15809, 0.412577, 0.397315, 1.698898, -1.017959, 0.571107, 0.17646, 0.74632, -0.111009, 0.627024, -0.021206, 1.037337, 1.43836, -0.853805, -0.279517, -0.356504, -0.820318, 0.908018, -0.278993, 0.858948, 0.45486, -0.673965, 0.2713, -0.307203, 0.956881, -0.840844, -0.435157, 0.183184, -0.131848, 0.51364, 0.202791, -0.790584, -0.077732, -0.378998, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.577812, 0.442658, 0.187206, -0.23436, -0.114072, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, 0.475646, -0.451544, 0.313871, -0.100672, 5.001972, 4.222007, 5.07124, 4.547288, 4.66795]"
"i have to go to an experiment for psychology in 45 minutes. my hand really hurts because i burned it on my curling iron. i had a really awesome dream last night but rachel woke me up from it. i miss my mom. i wonder how she is doing. i will visit her soon, though. i have a lot of homework this weekend. i am only concerned about chemistry since i haven't had it since 10th grade. my hand still hurts. i did my aerobics today. i wonder what the experiment will be this afternoon. i hope that i finish early. i have not been writing that long but it feels like forever. i am glad that my roommate and i are getting along. she is my best friend since seventh grade. my hand is feeling better now. i hope that my hair isn't losing its curl because i have to leave for the experiment right after this. i wonder when my cough will finally go away. the mtv music awards last night were cool. the funniest part was marilyn manson. my hand has a red spot on it from the burn. i wonder if we are still gonna go to the frat party tonight. i have a lot of homework still. i hope that i don't fall into the trap of freshman laziness and have my grades slip. my face itches. i am slightly worried about my earring hole--whether or not it's infected. now my nose itches. augh! only five minutes have passed! i want to go back to my room and work on my chemistry so that i'll feel better. i am excited about tomorrows football game. my back is getting sore so i'd better sit up straight. i'm glad that i'm getting this assignment out of the way. i wonder if kevin and briar will get married. i hope so because i really like briar and it would be cool for her to be my sis-in-law. i wonder who i'll marry. what if i don't find anyone? that would totally suck. however, i refuse to settle for just anyone. i wonder if i should change my major to psychology. i love stuff like these experiments. the girl next to me just introduced herself and left. she seemed nice. her name is sherrie. i will never remember that. if i major in psychology, i don't know if that will hurt my chances of getting into med-shcool. i don't know what to do. my hand hurts again. oh, wow, i'm almost done! this assignment is so easy and kinda fun. now my arm itches. my boss was named sherrie. this girl probably didn't even spell her name like that. now my hands are getting cramped. i feel kinda bad about talking about kristy because she was cool today. but that doesn't make up for her being annoying every other day. now my head itches. i think that i have dry skin. at least my mosquito bites are gone. i wonder if melissa and rachel are back yet. i have to cough again. this is getting really annoying. russ is so cute. i would love to date him if he wasn't me brother's best friend. my hand really hurts now. i hope that i am almost done because i can't type much longer. i am glad that it's the weekend. pennebaker is so funny. all my classes are cool. owwww! my hand. i am a pain wimp. three more minutes! lots of people that were in here are gone now. i like kinsolving because i don't have to go to flawn for the internet. my fingernails look very pink today. i forgot to take my vitamins today! my hand really hurts and my eyes are getting tired. my fingers feel swollen. i wonder when i will meet and date some guys here. hopefully it will be soon. i hope that no one is standing behind me reading this because i'm sure they'd wonder why i am writing this diary. my time is up! yeah! i have to go to my room to check my hair and lipstick again before i go. bye!

"today was an easy day for me since i only had two classes to attend. in math, i really had a hard time staying awake. i didn't know if it was because i knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. either way, i was very tired and at times, i just dozed off. in my edp class, i had to find information on financial aide. i also had to start a checking account at the credit union. by chance in the corner of my eyes, i could a brochure on financial loans for students. so i picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. right now i'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on friday. it's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. i probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. english at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. i had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. i tries to call tex many times, but had no luck. now i have to get used to waking up early every tuesday and thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. it's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that i can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. i really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on wednesday, i didn't take one and when i attended the class, i had a hard time staying awake. i'm glad that i'm in college now because i feel more independent than at home. my mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. but it gets to a point where i kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick. i can't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother. i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it. he still thinks he can beat me, but that won't probably ever be true until i'm about 60 and he's 57. this weekend, i hope to attend the football game with my friends again. i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot. it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before. it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. i might even paint my face to show some school spirit. maybe not. after i finish this assignment, i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday. i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment. the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it. my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. i think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. i guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo's was out of them. textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. i think my time is up so that's all i'm going to write. i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that's the purpose of this essay. so, that's all.

"i usually don't let too many things get to me because i just want to enjoy life. i think that there are a lot of interesting and wonderful things that each person is offered in their life time and i think that it is a shame if people don't take advantage of the things that they are given. at this moment, i am happy and cheerful and i don't have anything that is bothering me. it rained today and i didn't like it, but i wasn't too upset about it because i figured that we could use the rain. it also felt cool outside so the rain really didn't bother me too much. i also have a lot of homework that i need to get done, but i think that i have handled the stress very well. even though i have many different things to do, i have tried to pace myself and organize myself as to where i have less tension in my life. i try to organize myself based on what i think is convenient and this helps me be a more efficient person, and thus causes me to stay in a pretty good mood. during the past three weeks i have often thought about the new life that i live here at ut. it is completely different from high school, and even though it has taken a lot of adjustment on my part, i am beginning to see the benefits of college and i am beginning to enjoy myself a little more. at first i was really scared about attending college. i don't think it was anything specific about college, just the whole concept of moving away from home and being without the people that i love most in my life. but, since the beginning of school, i have been able to cope with this type of anxiety a little better and i feel that even though i have left home, i have a chance to start a whole new life here at ut. i will always be able to see the people that i love and i have accepted the fact that i will be able to see them whenever i want, and this has helped me in enjoying the college life better. there aren't very many different feelings that i usually feel in a day. for the most part, i am usually in a pretty good mood and i see myself as a fun person to be around. i try not to let the little things bother me, because i see so many people who let the small things in life ruin their entire day. my philosophy is why let one bad thing ruin all the good things that you have in life. this is why i usually try not to let too many things bother me or stress me out, it just takes all the fun out of life. i think that happiness is also a choice, people who are happy choose to be happy. they don't let too many things interfere in their lives and this helps them be happy with themselves, happy with those who are around them, and happy with the lives that they live. i choose to be happy everyday, and one of my short-term goals for each day is to end the day on a happy note. i think that it is important to end each day in a happy state of mind, otherwise your gloomy mood just carries over to the next day. when i have to evaluate my feelings, i would like to think that i am in a good mood most of the time and that people are happy to be around me. i enjoy making people's lives a little bit more fun for them. being happy is a very important aspect of my life and i think that happiness will help me achieve my goals and it will help me lead a happy and prosperous life. i hope to be happy with myself and have others around me be happy with me as well. i think that happiness brings success in your life. i think that if one is happy, then he is successful as well.

my ear itches. they used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me. the boy in the chair i usually sit in is thinking about me because i see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye. he eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine. so close to done and i loved doing this because i never write anymore. s ",1,"[0.287709, 0.476445, -0.002096, 0.545326, -0.924083, 0.470394, 1.189081, 1.463402, 0.715186, 0.761388, -0.012437, 0.185025, 0.0023, -1.562248, 1.241359, 0.0, -0.04277, -1.524061, -1.703497, -0.610884, -1.961828, -0.204219, -0.006959, 0.714857, -0.624052, 2.248453, 0.786912, -0.162328, -1.632622, -0.990672, 0.804186, -0.89946, -1.281083, -0.906028, -1.017959, -1.109326, -0.634111, -0.214538, -0.435838, -0.780322, -0.15874, -1.046164, -0.360669, 1.559867, 2.30012, 0.303826, -0.148503, -0.437823, -0.320628, -0.329843, 0.795674, -0.85454, -0.37019, -1.768179, -1.208009, -0.293209, -0.872042, -0.462405, 1.282965, -0.288254, -1.266081, -0.666632, -0.132127, 1.471732, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -1.023088, -0.303999, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.18081, -0.37208, 0.658685, -0.422267, -0.641632, 2.369069, 0.424516, -0.906027, 4.177324, 3.50421, 4.306797, 4.503357, 5.374848]"
"today was a very hard day at school. after my first class, m408d, i read my economics book for what seemed like forever. my friend chris can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. he is one of those, everything has to my my way"" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. i took spanish for three years in high school and i like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. he got mad at me and my other friend for talking in ""spanglish"" because he does not like it. he gave us a ultimatum and i got ticked. man to day was rough. seinfield is on. that is a good show. kramer is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with jim carrey's. the timer says 3 minutes 20 seconds and even this feels like forever. i have a lot of chores to do. put up our sheep, clean the pool. my mom is going to kill me if i do not get those done. i guess i can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. i need to get something to drink but i cannot get up for another 15 minutes. oh well. i need to change my calendar. the stupid thing is still in august. the candle in my hallway has a strong odor as i can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. cool. they are playing the rock on usa. i think i'll watch this as i type. it should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. i got a economics quiz tomorrow and i am not looking forward to that. my professor is great though. a very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. his examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. he even sold us this bag of 3 musketeers he had. he must have made at least $5 off a bag that i could get at wal-mart for about $2. i did not get one. but if i had a quarter on me at the time i would have. i need to turn on my light as i can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. it is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. i needs to rain. they say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to ""predict"" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. but a weatherman does seem like a cool job. you can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying ""well we try to predict the weather the best we can but mother nature does what she wants sometimes. "" alright, i only have 8 minutes left to write. my the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. my computer is getting old and i need a replacement. i have pop-ups bad. somehow, somewhere, i got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. in doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. user-initiated contact goes through unmolested. so by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. i only have 5 minutes left to write now. that is good. man, this is a sweet part of the rock. this is the scene in which nicholas cage is in a yellow ferarri and is chasing sean connery, who is in a black hummer. this scene has a lot of good action. i like action movies. i guess as i guy i find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. my belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. i still need to get my economics book. i got the main one but the second one is still at the co-op. my luck they will run out of it by the time i remember to go by and pick it up. my dog needs to stop scratching. and my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. i would find that annoying. man i could really use that drink now. good thing i have less than a minute left to type. in the words of homer simpson. ""woohoo!"" this has been fun. i actually wish i could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. hope this is a good paper. oh, it says if i want i can still keep on typing. in that case i think i will. where did my remote go?. haha. got ya. you thought i was going to type more didn't ya? well ok i am done now. i can finally un-mute my tv and go get that coke.

"i really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. it annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. just a few minutes ago i was trying to wash my towels and i couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. i felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. it's not like i would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but i feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. well i built up the courage because i was annoyed and i then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. so i had a whole who-ha over nothing. oh well. i actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. i love clean clothes that smell really good. i use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. i keep looking at the clock because i'm waiting for road rules to come on. they kicked this girl ruthie off last time because she has an alcohol problem. i really don't think it solved the problem at all. now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. i guess i've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so i wouldn't know what it is like. needless to say, ruthie is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. she firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. don't they all say that? well i hope she gets better because i know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. i think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. i know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. i know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. rosie o'donnell talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. she thinks it's a great thing. i think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. although i am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, i think this is totally different. these kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. i think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. ok-enough about that. i've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. i take mine in the morning and i'm in there for seriously about 2 or 3 minutes. whereas she's in there for like 10 or so. i wonder why that is. i guess i'm in such a rush in the morning that i'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. there doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now but i guess essentially i'm doing that now. maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. i'd rather focus on what's ahead tomorrow rather than the stressful day i had today, primarily in the computer lab. i've decided that i really don't like programming and the technical stuff of computers. i really don't care how it works as long as it does for me. i'll just have to put up with that class until christmas to get my credit. i'd feel kind of sad if i was a professor and people only took my class because their academic advisor advised them too or if they just did it to fill their credits. i guess they're used to it and don't take it personally. whatever. ok- time's up now. i've been writing for 20 minutes as told. bye.

"okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. i have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. but i am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but i am getting the hang of college life. most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. i want to stay, besides i went to dallas last weekend for labor day for my sister's birthday. i got to see my best friend zach who is now in colorado trying to wrestle. but i am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since i will there the first weekend of october for txou and the santana concert. then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. my oldest sister maggie is bringing her new fiance. i haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. they both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a catholic church. catholicism is kind of funny that way i come from a very strong catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the university of dallas which is catholic and not liberal ut. however, my parents strategically placed my in dobie, next to the university catholic center. smart people. little do they know the last time i went to church was when i was in dallas. my dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what i have wanted to do for the majority of my life. but last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now i am in dean speck's architecture class which is fascinating i love it. who knows when i'll figure out what i want to do, i do have the feeling that no matter what i decide to do that i'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. but that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. my sister jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her lsat and apply to law school. she is even applying to ut law that would be cool if she was down here too. i like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. it's not that she places that responsibility on me but i am the closest to her out of my family so i am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. yeah, she's applying to law school. at least she has some sort of direction. it's hard for her to hear the truth. but i slammed it down her throat this summer and i think it hit her. i wonder when kim is getting home. i think she said 5:00. i like having the whole suite to myself though i can actually get some stuff done. we have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with reese. reese is probably lonely without jessica around to bug her. i hope i get her as my diamond sister, that would be really cool. kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see dave matthews band one of my favorites. i have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so i don't think i am going to go. unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. i'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. i miss my dog. it took me 17 years to get a dog and i finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and i leave for school. i'll probably breed labs when i'm older i love labs and i don't see why i'd ever have any other kind of dog. my suitemates are really organized i am typing on amy's computer and i'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, i'm done!

"good morning. eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours. they say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but i feel ten is a little more at par. i'm trying to wake up so the music of the late elliott smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to. it's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, i don't think i could have got better roommates. i love sitting at my laptop when i wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath. our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying. it's absurd really. so monday night i found out from some of my friends in college station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there. damn aggies. can't live with them, can't kill them. it's a cruel world. but i'll be better off without her i think. i talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart. where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit. but you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face. but i suppose it's like morgan freeman says in the movie seven, ""love costs, it takes effort. "" that's true. back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves. he told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases. for instance alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt. god she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author. but she has no conscious knowledge of art. ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money. and well obviously she doesn't know what ""love"" really is. but then again maybe i don't either. but i know i loved her, i believed her lies. i bought the false love she was selling for cheap. i still love her i suppose, i can't deny it. but she loved herself, before she loved me. and now i have to do the same. i have to be strong and let time heal all. another thing my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing. like i was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life. she had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing. and i quote ben harper, ""so many people to love in my life, why do i worry about one?"" i know there are better people out there so. and i have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever. i honestly felt bad after i chewed her out and she was crying. try and figure that one out. i suppose i'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last. but i don't believe that saying. nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end. i believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them. i'm glad i don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much i enjoy college compared to high school. high school, what a joke. you are not pushed, you are not inspired. in high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd. to conform and be normal. i always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country. but then again i am just one person. so i try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by. i guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace. i try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions. i think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not. for instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car. just relax and roll down the windows and cruise. but if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable. it's sad when people don't care important issues. i guess i just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc. i think life is a crazy thing. a conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action. i think that maybe one day, i'll have all the answer, and then i will die. maybe one day i will find a love that is true. maybe. maybe i think too much.

"ok. here we go. well i really don't have much to say right now. i've done this type of writing before. it was a strange experience. all i ended up writing was the lyrics to some song i couldn't get out of my head. i just kept going over and over again. don't you hate that? i especially hate it when it's like some obnoxious song that i only know the chorus to or something. hmmm. right now i'm wondering how in the world i'm supposed to keep on typing for twenty minutes and keep on coming up with things to say. it's kind of like when you meet someone new and you're trying to have a conversation with them and you keep hitting those brick walls. i constantly do that. you can only ask a person their major so many times. i wish i would have taken a typing class in high school. everyone else i know did but i procrastinated so i could only take a programming class for my computer credit. but it was good that i took that class. now i've learned that i really do hate programming. i have to come to terms with the fact that i like computers yet i hate programming. i think my brain would slowly build up pressure and then explode when i'm in my 40s if i became a programmer. my typing skills are atrocious! i think i've been out of practice. i wonder what agnes is doing? she's my roommate and she's sitting next to me. she always gets a lot of e-mail, yet she complains regularly that no one writes her. i like get nothing but that could be because i don't write anyone either. oh well. i think if i got into the e-mail habit again, i would waste way too much time in the computer lab anyway. oh no. mind block. this is kind of like writing a letter to your closest friend. (which i also haven't done in a while. ) just say whatever an who cares if they care or not. what are you guys going to do with this information anyway?? i missed the first day of class so i really don't know how this stuff is going to be used. i've always been afraid that if i ever went to a psychologist or something, that they would end up telling me that i'm nuts or something. or they would know something about me that i really don't want them to know. and there's a lot of that kind of stuff. everyone in this room is staring blankly into the screen of their computers. isn't it amazing the power these little boxes of silicon and metal have over us? imagine our world today without computers. (apparently i actually learned something from my comp sci class here) if one day all computers just stopped working, we would all be screwed. the world would go haywire. i would go nuts. and don't limit it to the computer in the traditional sense. we're talking the little computer chip in your remote control or in your light fixtures. everything. hey. that would make a good story. i bet it's been done before but i think i just inspired myself. that'll be my second movie. did i say i wanted to be a director? well i do. now i have three ideas for my first films. i really can't wait. i need to go out and buy some books. i've been running out of things to read. i love books. actually i have a new favorite author. jeff noon. that reminds me i need to look him up on the web. i wonder if he's written anything else?? i hope so.

"so, i am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. i am wondering about this class, i have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'a' in it. i really hope that i can because i am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. i feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and i stay home and read well last night i just goofed off most of the night because i couldn't concentrate. since i don't know what to expect on our first college tests i am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. i had a lot of fun at the delt pledge party this weekend though, i was a time that i went out and it was worth it. i just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; i will need to fix that in a minute because i know the computer is right. it felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. the football game is going to be horribly hot but i can't wait! i really need to get back into typing. i mean that i have been making a lot of typos i hope that i am catching them. i am listening to simon and garfunkle i love them, one of my best friends, hilary and i used to always sing to ""cecilia"". hilary goes to tech; i haven't talked to her in a while. i need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but i am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. it will be better tomorrow because i only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on friday. monday i have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! it's been nice since we haven't had a monday class yet, though. i went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so i tried to go to gregory but i forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. i went to the coop to return 2 books but the worker told me that i needed to bring another receipt so i'll have to back tomorrow. i have been trying to stay on campus on days that i have classes with breaks that are 1' hours or less between classes. that makes me read and eat lunch outside and so i don't waste time walking home and back to class. it is a good plan but by the end of the day i am very tired. i like this writing assignment. it make me aware of what i think about randomly i guess that is the point of the project. i want to see the movie ""bring it on"" it's a cheerleader movie. i heard it was corny but that i would like it i cheered in high school and so i guess it's a given that i would enjoy anything of this sort. i can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game i love football too. it's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. it sort of feels like i am at camp. i like it here. oh, it's been 22 minutes! bye ",0,"[-1.235237, 0.486502, 1.751439, 0.101892, -0.410889, 0.843692, -0.850323, -0.57972, -1.205047, -0.226927, -0.09141, -0.590446, -0.249265, 0.809531, -0.672977, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.009527, 0.322969, -0.268752, 0.268385, -0.742368, -1.027909, -1.84035, -0.624052, 0.731944, 0.993208, 0.725447, -0.997814, -0.109265, 0.452109, -0.293784, -1.317229, -0.446943, -0.705829, -0.694709, -0.106185, 0.26077, -0.702424, -0.308125, 0.216547, -0.853532, -0.44421, 0.29196, 0.343879, 0.213312, -0.082493, -1.270407, 0.080502, -1.272304, -1.34699, 0.499614, 0.830139, -0.124145, 0.172824, 0.900667, 1.447464, 0.448957, -0.303422, 1.019982, 1.424388, 1.395996, -0.480161, 0.158339, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.727412, -0.409071, 0.087244, 1.601755, -0.607823, 0.248278, -0.337085, 1.117195, 0.192059, -0.451544, -0.111607, -0.481568, 4.725025, 3.652418, 4.936298, 4.843225, 4.365085]"
"i've spent my second day at the university of texas and i'm trying not to hate it. i feel lonely and depressed. i miss wesley, i miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when i first went to wesley i hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now i know what the other extreme feels like, i really miss it. i kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when i was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in boston. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people i know. i feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. i can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if i'll like them, because i don't see anyone who fits my idea of what ""friend"" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with kate yesterday because i didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- i say that joking of course, but i guess i feel like i can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - i mean i know who she is and it's what i expect. i'm so glad she came here too - i don't know what i would do if i were totally alone down here. i think it's really a different experience for me because i've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here i don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. i didn't expect to miss wesley so much. i thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone i've seen is the sorority'frat type and i hate it! i never thought wesley was that diverse or funky, but i guess i've realized what i had all along. maybe i'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. i mean i know there are plenty of wendy wesley oh-so-perfect women at wesley who drive me up the wall, but i know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say? i just had an argument with my mom and i feel really guilty, i haven't seen her a lot lately and i was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how i should rrahhhh - i hate that. i told her that i was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me i can't do it, right when i'm in the middle of an assignment. i'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. i'm at acc where i worked this summer and i came here because 1-i have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 2- i thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like i still mattered to someone. now i just feel like hell. i think i want to cry, but i always feel so crappy when i do that - since i usually do it for some really stupid reason, like i feel like a jerk or something. god, i just feel like telling everyone to shove it today! what a way to start the semester! ok, i'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. i'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but i hope i can. i really want eric to go, but i'm not sure if i want to want him to go. i hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, i'm sick of getting hurt. i think i might just like him because he's there and i'm feeling so lonely right now. i don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal? i'm not sure. i keep going over this in my head - why can't i find the right one? not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that i really like' one that fits all the qualifications i want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. i'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, i can't fully concentrate on what i'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there.

"i've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. tryint to plan everything out so i get to see everyone. i miss home. the people, the places. my church, my room, and all the little things too. just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. so peaceful. so safe. one things i've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. it won't ever be tha same. the relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. susan, amy, jennifer, john, mikey, jeni, ms. betty, my parents. you can't replace that. it's always there, just sitting, empty. sure, i can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. they're all differnt and unique. my left arm is tired. well, i just thought that so i figured i'd write it. and i just thought about writing about my arm. wow! and i just thought about thinking about writing about my arm. it never ends. weird. i've always been interested in how the human minds works. it's funny when you think about it. here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work! isn't that weird? when you think about it, where do you get yourself? how can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with? it's impossible. an endless cirlce of thought and ideas. the human mind is a mystery, and always will be. that kind of impresses me that i came with that. gee, i'm smart. just kidding. well. ten more minutes. ok, i ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. my shoulder hurts. wow, i complain a lot. i'm feeling my elbow right now. it's swollen or something. i'm not sure why. i've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. who knows? it doesn't hurt, but i don't know if i should avoid straining it or what. i'm supposed to work out today. we'll see. i've been thinking about someone back home a lot. her name is cam and we met about a month before i left for college. there was this kind of initial attraction i guess you'd say. kind of weird. i haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. i think it was her bright personality. she has thing kind of glow about her. she's always laughing. i like that in people, because i need to laugh more sometime. so we kind of talked about our relationship some, and i told her i didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, i mean, since i was leaving for college. she's a junior in high school. but we've kept in touch a lot. i think she wants a committment, but i don't think that's smart. but you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. it's like faith. god doesn't always make sense to me. i hear all the time people trying to disprove god, or christ, or the bible, or christianity. like i'm taking this class, the rise of christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. but the fact is this: i know what jesus has done in my life, and nothing can change that. ever! what he did was illogical, it was beyond understanding, it was a miracle! and nothing can disprove that, not science, not anything. how do people react to that then? well, people's final defense is usually, ""well, then you must be crazy.

for the past few days and now i have been thinking a lot about my friends back hone. i am thinking of all the good times we had and how i miss them a lot. and of course i am thinking about girls and especially one of them. i also thinking aout this summer and how i met a lot of different kinds of people by attending the preview program and gettting an early start on college. adjusting from hihg school took college took a little bit of time. having fun and partying are always on my mind. i partied a lot this summer. it was a lot easier then because i only had to worry about two classes; one of them was pre-cal and i knew i could hadle that so it was basically only e306. some other thoughts that also come to my mind at this moment are thoughts about my parents and how i miss them and my rest of my family back home. thinking about that sometimes makes me sad but i don't let it get to me. i am usually a very happy person and people can tell when something is bothering me or not. lately i have not gone out mainly because no one has really invited me go out with them. but also because i have been a little low on money. there is money in the bank but i don't know for how long there will be money there. this summer i spent a lot more monwy than i should have spent. i don't usually worry about money but i really spent a lot and the worst part of it is that i don't know waht i spent it on. at this instant i am thinkign about my grades i got this summer. i was disappointed with them because i know i could of done better. i got a b in english in which i am pretty satisfied because i can't write good at all. but i know i should of gotten an a in pre cal. i put a lot of effort and i thought i deserved an a but the teacher ws sort of a bi---- towards the end. i was really frustrated with this. i had never been so caught on grades until this occurred. so instead of starting my college career with a 3. 5 i started with a f******* 3. 0. this really frieken sucks big time. ,0,"[-1.020978, -0.787937, 1.720726, -0.766384, -1.328506, 0.025674, -0.422593, -1.029268, -0.494328, -0.969111, -0.140492, -0.590446, 0.292367, 0.632413, 0.070188, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.280924, 0.696588, -0.408043, 0.625072, -0.742368, -0.499125, -0.190427, -0.624052, 1.543011, -0.079623, 0.562139, -0.041464, -0.552756, -0.529298, -1.430891, 0.560599, 0.444741, -0.099575, 1.940499, 0.489501, 1.733985, 0.878121, -0.488051, -1.038726, -1.574876, -0.077997, -2.256084, -1.429535, -1.112103, -1.093488, -0.928607, -1.119457, -0.977, 0.288102, 0.883426, 2.387235, -1.721641, -1.011497, -0.027544, 0.065301, 0.077916, 1.988411, -0.039549, -0.525812, -1.110382, -0.480161, -0.080578, 0.114222, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.113662, -1.364578, -0.073676, 1.116244, -0.607823, -0.37208, 1.404315, -0.422267, -0.952104, -0.451544, 2.651461, -0.649695, 4.385341, 4.360907, 4.459747, 4.549858, 4.462911]"

"i guess i'll use this space to rant about this topic. yes, i used to have a car. she's a silver-blue '86 camry that my mom bought when i was in first grade. she was the first new car my mom ever bought, and i think she made a good choice. she bought a new camry in '96, when i turned sixteen, which, by the way, is the nicest car i've ever had the pleasure of riding in. strap $15,000 to the dashboard, and you have a lexus. but anyway, i drove the old camry, pretty hate machine (after nine inch nails' debut album, which is awesome)until i went away to college last year, on my little sister's 16th birthday. so you can probably guess what happened to her (the camry, not my sister). yes she got two huge dents in it, running into the same garage behind the restaurant where we work, a garage around which i have managed to maneuver countless times without causing bodily harm to pretty hate machine (which my sister so rudely calls ""the velvet rocket!!!""). ok, i crashed her once and busted her right headlight, but it wasn't my fault, and the other lady's insurance paid for it all, and i felt terrible for putting her (the car) through all that. gill showed not the slightest sign of regret for her thoughtless actions, having no respect for pretty hate machine. she's such a great car. first of all, she screams ""mom,"" so i never get pulled over in her, not even during the six months she had a busted headlight. she might as well have vanity plates that say ""mom, rn. "" second, she's the most reliable car in the world, which is one of the reasons i felt bad when i crashed her, because she's not used to the shop at all. no, she's never broken down. she's got 150,000 miles on her, yes, she's ""been around the black"" a few times, rrhaha. she's never broken down. third, i love her because she's idiot-proof. she doesn't just have that beeping noise when you don't fasten your seatbelt; she turns the headlights and the dome light off when you leave the car, so you'd have to be worse than an idiot to run out the battery, which my sister did i might add. and you have to lock it from the outside, or else 1 door stays unlocked, so you can't lock your keys in her. she's the perfect car. oh, and since she's so old and a 4-seater, she's cheap to insure. yes, i have a sort of sick emotional attachment to her, but she's just so awesome. she's like an heirloom, having been in the family long enough to serve two generations. i get to drive her whenever i go home, which is nice. it's hard to take her for granted when i don't get to see her that much. oh, i forgot to add that we took our family christmas card picture in front of, with me holding the keys out in front of my face. there was this really cute boy in high school named john king who drove the same car, except he had the windows tinted so that he could drive and be sketchy at the same time, i guess. anyway, i thought he was cute, and the fact that he drove such an awesome yet practical was somehow really sexy to me. and this summer there was this guy named jon who worked at the same restaurant i did back home who drove the exact same car, except his was more gray than blue. we somehow a big kick out of trying to park our cars next to each other, or opposite each other, or in some geometric configuration. what really kills about her is that every day when i pass by the utc on the way to class there she is, parked right there, the exact same car, taunting me, torturing me. i miss my ol' girl.

"" that kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. i love college. dave is now playing granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. i love this song. dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . ggggggggggoooooooooo. ut is turning out to be pretty sweet. i love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. my last school had 1200 students so i knew just about everyone i saw, its a little different here, but its all good. just looked at the timer and it looks like i got about 3 minutes left. is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay? anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. phsycology is very interesting i really liked the lie detector test. props to michael for tricking that thing the second time around. just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought? one minute left that's really all i'm thinking about right now. the class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. bye.

"i am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness. i just had dinner. it was very delicious. i ate at the kinsolving dormitory food center. the library is really quiet and i can hear the tying on the computer. people are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting. i can't wait until this week is over. it will be labor day weekend. i can't believe a holiday is just around the corner. it seems like just yesterday it was summer and i was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out. over the labor day weekend, i would love to go back home to houston and see my family, but i kind of would prefer to just stay here in austin. there is so much to do here and there is so much freedom. in a way it can be good but i really need to manage my time wisely. today's psychology was really interesting. i loved the in class experiment that was done. it was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard. i feel tired right now and i would like to go to sleep, but i know i should get this writing assignment out of the way. i was talking to my brother about computers today. it was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone. my mind went blank for a while and i can't think of anything to write. tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday. i can't believe she will be one year older. she is a senior in high school right now and i bet she is stressing over college applications like i was during senior year. i hope she gets everything done in time. i remember senior year was really interesting. i had to research a lot with colleges and what i wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major. so far, education is what i want to do. i think it will be fun especially if i decide to work with elementary students. i am feeling really sleepy right now and i can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before. i miss my family. even though i am used to being away for a month. i know i will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months. i hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives. i also miss my friends back home especially my church family. i can't believe i am actually going to say this or actually type it but i also miss my pastor. especially his sermons. as i am here in austin, i have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same. i guess i am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us. especially since i grew up in that church, i really miss all the good memories i have made there. i can't wait until the weather gets colder here in austin. i heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning. i really would like to see falling snow. i really love the cold weather and i like to play in the snow. today's weather was nice. i could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face. there was less sun than usual. maybe it is supposed to rain who knows. but i can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully. i still can't believe that i am a freshman in college. i thought when i arrived here i would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in. so far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time. i try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time i spend in class. i am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university. i just don't know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things. i really hope that i will do well in the first semester of college in fact i hope to do well all the years i am in college. i think i've kind of forgotten how to study. after college applications were done and over with and after i knew where i was going to attend college, i kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes. i still studied but just not as hard and not as much as i should have. i feel like taking a shower and going to bed now. my eyes feel they are slowing shutting but i'm trying to keep awake. there are so many people here at the library. i knew there would be a lot of people but it's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party. i suddenly feel itchy everywhere. i think a bug bit me. it is really annoying and itchy. this has been the most exciting assignment ever. it will be really weird to look back on what i wrote.

"ok, right now i feel tired and annoyed. maybe because i just broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months but maybe its because i couldnt get this website to work forever or the fact that i went to bed at two for no reason. putting the tired aside, i'm also pretty exited. my brother is teaching me how to solve a rubiks cube. i love doing things like that, but sometimes i give up too easily. not now though, i can't. not about the rubiks cube, but about the business school that everyone i talk to feels the need to tell me how difficult it is to get in, but i'm not giving up. i'm trying to adjust to austin and its really not that hard, i just don't want to call it my home because its not- i've lived in houston my entire life. that's my home. even though i was raised in houston, ill end up in colorado. i feel like i'm trying to make conversation to a comuter which doesn't really work so ill just tell you about me. i love the color blue-any shade of blue, i love them all. i love cold weather even though i don't know what its like to be in a snow storm or shovel snow to get out of the driveway. i want a big truck when i'm old-not to show off but to be comfortable. i want to work, not be a housewife even though i do want kids maybe two or three. i admire my mom. she struggles and i love her. i was raised mormon even though i am not mormon anymore. i love dave matthews and sarah maclaclan thier perceptions of life are awesome i love songs that hit me right in the heart whether its an uplifting song or not. i love writing even though it takes me forever to write something worth reading. i like kissing. only when its sweet and meaningful for him and me. i love being a friend. helping those that i care about-it just makes me tingle inside. even though i wasnt always like that. i used to have the best scream. i was a selfish kid. i threw fits. i'm better, now i like to share. i didnot smile until i was two. sometimes i worry i have a bad heart because i can randomly have my heart go wild (literaly) i wonder sometimes too if i got my moms manic depression. i'm not a sad person overall but i can be a lot. i always wondered how that worked too. maybe this course will help me understand. i like beer, but not too much. i used to drink to get my mind of things, now i realize that was dumb. now i write to get it off my chest. what do i think about? god. the world. people. why? i don't stand up to my dad even though my front pretends i do. i really just avoid him. his wife is evil, but her kids are the best. how do things like that work out? i have four brothers and a sister. i love them all. they are all so interesting and so individualistic. i have an ex boyfriend named ben that i am obsessed with and so does my roomate, mary. we both wore the same prom dress and bought the same bedding even though we did not shop together. i want her dad to mary my mom hes neat. he writes for the houston chronicle and my mom is an english teacher. even though it wasnt her choice. she had to start working to be financially stable to avoid my dad. that s why i'm determined to make it in the business school and not be a housewife and drive a big truck.

"excersise really does work. it does release happy chemicals. i feel reasonably energized now. but at the same time, i feel like it already peaked. its wearing off. jealousy is funny. chris and harvey met three girls while i was gone. i feel left out. i have a girlfriend, and i love her more than anything. i miss her. id give anything for one of her hugs now. but perhaps just the fact that they are meeting people and i am not is making me jealous. but. if they had met some guy, i don't think i'd be very jealous. its girls. i like girls. girls make good friends. i seem to have more close female friends than most with girlfriends do. i always thought this was a good thing, but lately, given my reaction to this new college environment im begginning to wonder if it is. im begginning to wonder whether i just want to meet girls, and have the romantic tension that will never amount to anything more. the romantic tension makes me feel good about myself. shouldnt my girlfriend make me feel good about myself? she does. but i always want more. it's impossible to do this assignment without sort of planning it out. i want music now. i still feel jealous. but while writing about it, some of it has subsided. i feel guilty for being so jealous of my close friends. in fact, my best friend. my roommate. i don't know if he considers me his best friend. it would flatter me more than anything to find out he did. if he ever told me. if i died, i wonder how many people would say their best friend died? i feel like im a best friend to many people. i feel guilty for this, because best friend usaually implies an exclusive position. now that i think back, there have been many instances where one of my friends would tell another friend that they were my best friend. i considered the friend they told my best friend. and i felt like i had done something wrong, like made the person who wasnt my best friend feel to close to me. i like close friendships, with anybody. i don't like going to parties. i like hanging out in small groups, or just talking to one person for a long time. i think i have made a lot more close friends this way than people that go to parties. i think a lot of people are jealous of me, because i manage to maintain intimate friendships with so many people. its odd how oblivious i am to this jealousy. im constantly insecure. i've questioned repeatedly how anybody could like me. i never want to meet anybody like me, i could see through them to everything i hate about myself. even as i tell myself now that people will jealous of me, im sure something will happen tonight that will make me forget that. when im jealous of someone, i don't understand how they could be jealous of me. i'm constantly jealous. for my freshman seminar on concepts of sin, we have to pick our own sin to write about. my sin will be envy. the one i can't control. other sins don't give me as much trouble. im a very restrained person. i think restraint and balance are more important than anything else. especially in love. i say that because i remember a word my teacher was talking about that meant to love your spouse too much. she said it used to be a sin, but its not anymore. it began with a j. i wish i could remember it. im sure ill look it up soon. its a word that relates to me a lot, and i bet i'll sound very smart when i use it. people will think im a very educated person who not only understands himself, but also uses big words to describe his self understanding. anyway, i agree that loving your spouse too much is a sin. my spouse type figure and me seem to have a mutual understanding about this. its odd how at times i love everything, and at other times i love nothing. i wonder if the aderall i take affects that. it seems to stimulate my emotions. sometimes when i take it late at night so that i can focus on studying, i start crying from pure emotion. heh, well, obviously not pure. harvey aays its okay to take because it was prescribed to me. i still think id feel better about myself if i wasnt on it. this band makes me feel better when im troubled. its odd, because theyre lyrics are very meaningless to me. but the music has this sleazy, yet upbeat sound that somehow taps into what im feeling. i wonder if they created this sound on purpose. i saw them live in austin, it was a fun show. i remember a drunk man who was extremely happy jumping up and down a lot and yelling right next to me. that was the first time i ever wondered if i should start drinking. i think i've still decided no.

my duty is to get a date tonight for friday when we have our mixer that is 70's based. i am looking forward to meeting some more girls than i already know. i believe that this stuff is fun whether or not it takes a whole lot of my time. although i have not had enough time to work out as much as i would like. i feel as though i am losing some muscle tone. the food at towers does not help with the dirth of a suitable protein source the food is extremely inedible i have a very hard time consuming enough food to keep my normal body weight up. at dinner i usually eat with either my pledge brothers or my roommates. my roommates are nice guys even if my suite mates are afraid of girls and this hampers our activities. i have a large amount of laundry to do but really do not feel like doing it. i have to acquire red wing boots by tomorrow or my team will lose the game. school is strange because i am never sure if i have done all my work or if i need to study some stuff more it is hard to judge how much you need to study when you have never taken a college test before. i reckon the tests will be fairly challenging although i think my high school prepared me well for these tests. i need to ask a date to the rice football game but i am not sure just who to ask. the football games are cool although my ticket at the first game had my on the highest row possible. i think ricky williams is good although he is not as good as jamal williams of tennessee. i think texas will lose by a large margin to ucla then they will get stomped by kansas state. we will finally win at rice but then we will win at the other teams i think although the schedule is a mystery. i can't wait to go home to memphis at thanksgiving to see all my friends. and my freaking car. i wish i could play more basketball and release my athletic energies. ,0,"[-0.499535, -0.08705, -1.061377, -0.08649, -0.938367, 0.214419, 0.510505, -0.265027, -0.183751, -1.135724, -0.090557, -0.590446, 1.025677, 0.275734, 0.695604, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.729405, 0.175507, 1.371047, 0.554386, 0.099575, -1.105653, 1.849801, -0.624052, 0.720266, 0.358881, -0.562906, 0.158296, 0.492093, -1.100231, 0.439833, -0.287996, -0.15076, -1.017959, 0.937008, -0.689821, -0.600749, -0.346446, 0.214412, 1.026401, -0.28227, 1.045774, -0.364198, -0.262514, -0.579704, 0.015345, 0.292703, -0.646567, -0.573327, 0.024378, -0.540968, -1.373597, 1.515516, 1.381404, -1.093188, -0.165382, -0.954251, -2.651244, 0.134551, -1.149243, 3.328984, -0.480161, -0.745201, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.503965, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, -1.351574, -0.451544, -0.408772, -1.701201, 4.770339, 4.295441, 4.454088, 4.629474, 4.2319]"
"so this is the third time that i have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning. explorer crashed and so i had to reboot my machine which can take a while. it's amazing how slow pc's get after you install anti-virus software. in the process of it rebooting i went and made a cup of coffee. bavarian hazlenut form heb, delicious. so i was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment i took in a humanities class a while back. they asked us to spend 20 minutes alone somewhere, anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes. i spent it in the campus parking lot, a wide open space, fairly peaceful, trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes, not really sure of the purpose. after the 20 minutes was up i realized that i was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start. normally i would walk around just using the sense that were needed, sight, hearing and focused on coordination, driving, etc. during the 20 minute period in the parking lot i became aware much more of my sense of touch, the feel of the paper i was writing on, the smell of my surroundings, the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze, i've mentioned that twice now, what does that mean? i just finished my first cup of coffee. my apologies about my spelling. i have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later. i don't know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling. i hope i'm not confusing it. probably not. a thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason. south padre on a breezy summer evening. again this breeze thing, what's with that? in fact i'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now. i just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air. perhaps i need to go outside when i'm done here and soak it up. it's like a vitamin that the body is lacking, eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin. for some reason , perhaps i didn't get out enough at the weekend, i need to feel the breeze. central market, i have a coupon to central market sitting in front of me. i like that place and apparently if i go there this week and spend $30 or more then i can get $10 off rib-eye steaks. the fan spins slowly overhead, a gentle clicking, a low hum, the sound of my typing and then, silence. why are keyboards so awkward. isn't there a better way to do this. surely a psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something, more ergonomic. i'm thinking about my brother. i just spent 2. 5 months in the u. k. during the summer working for him, selling. they are a web services company. he is the owner and a good guy. he is the glue that keeps many things together. he has 3 kids who are all precious. one has a spine problem and can't walk. that unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge. english people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other. they do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong. i got attacked while i was in the u. k. in the street at 8:30 in the morning on friday the 13th. i was on my way to work and got attacked. the police there are awful. they just don't care. they are nowhere to be found. in the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you. i have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality. just my impression. power hungry wimps. no idea for the big picture, just cya and demonstrate what little power you have. why can't they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it. did you know that england has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in europe. the british government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem. why do they not have a public intoxication law now???? you can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another!!!! well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up. time to go. hope this has not been boring. have a great day. go usa!!!

"it's funny how people allow themselves to be manipulated by words. i was just reading my philosophy book, and different philosophers were arguing the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. as i read i found myself being manipulated by words. i had to step back and look at things as a whole to determine my own view on situations. i think many people are victims of the society that we have created. we live in a cutthroat world that is very demanding. people feel pressured to please others above themselves. i believe that this can be dangerous. people too often define success by how much money they have, how many cars they have, and what their resume looks like. many times we try to obtain success at all costs; even at the cost of our own happiness and well being. students feel pressure from many sources. many of those sources are our parents. they feel pressure to be a success in their parents eyes no matter what the costs. even if the costs includes the well being of their self. this is a sad occurrence. we should be encouraged by our parents. their is a thin line between encouraging and pressuring. we look for that line and do our best to walk as close to it as possible. its funny how our state of mind changes from time to time. we go from being majorly stressed out to being very calm. aristotle believed that we should always surf somewhere in the middle, never getting too high or too low. i think that makes some sense. every time i get stressed out i have to step back and look at things in perspective. then i ask myself if this ""thing"" i'm stress about is really worth it. more times than not it isn't. my question is what is the right way to live. if we never push ourselves we never allow ourselves a chance to grow. if we push ourselves too much we run the risk of becoming depressed. i guess like everything else, it all depends on the circumstances. some things have a tendency to stick in my head. movie lines for example. i'm always able to remember with great accuracy. numbers on the other hand, i don't remember so well. what causes that? is that a gift or a flaw? i have an identical twin brother and we are total opposites. i remember movie lines and he remembers phone numbers very well. also, we look nothing alike. isn't that weird. every time we meet someone and tell them we're identical twins they never believe us. maybe the doctor made a mistake and told my mom the wrong thing. identical twins are cool because we have the same genetic makeup. i guess that takes the individuality away a little, but hey, its just like anything else, we've got to take the good with the bad.

"i am pretty proud of myself today, for i got much more accomplished than i thought i would. i figured that after my last class i would just take a nap. but instead, i went to the gym and had a great workout. it's always good to make a plan of everything that you want to do in a day. i always have to do lists. they are so useful, and i feel so organized when i make them. and when i finish everything on one list, i feel so good. it is a great feeling. i haven't been having too many great feelings recently. i'm not sure if i like it here. i don't think i ever will either; that is what bothers me the most. everyone keeps telling me that it is going to get better, that i'll meet more and more people that i like. i just don't think it's going to happen. i really wish i had gone to brandeis, for things would be so much easier. it is a smaller school, near boston, much closer to my parents. then i'd be able to see brian and jessie so much more often. i probably could see them every weekend if i wanted to. my phone bill would definitely be a hell of a lot less. that would be so good, because i don't have enough money. i feel bad asking for more from my parents, but it would just be so much easier. i think i really want to apply for that job at george women. that is definitely a cool store because it has everything that i love there! another thing i have noticed about being a college student, is that now i don't care about how i look or dress or anything like that. in high school, it was such a big deal to wear the ""right"" clothes and things like that. i didn't even mind doing that, and it seemed normal. i just miss my friends so much. i made such great connections with three people in high school, and i miss them so much. i am so jealous of all my friends who are so close to each other. why do i have to get stuck with going to this huge school? it's not fair that i have to go through so many changes all at the same time. i just wish things were easier. it would make me so much happier. i feel like i have done something awful, that i deserve to feel like crap. i know that if i just keep on going, day by day, then things have to get better. i'm just so used to having so many friends and knowing so many people. i have just gotten thrown into this huge pile of people, and not knowing any of them is just plain weird. i just hope that getting use to this school will be a lot easier and quicker than it seems like it will be. i think that things will become so much better once i get used to this school. i certainly hope so because i just want to be happy.

"well today i went with my friend kai to his texas crew orientation. he tried to get me to join, but i just don't think that crew would be the sport for me. i prefer to play volleyball above all other sports. just this past week, i signed up for the volleyball teams here at ut. i would really enjoy to play for the school, or at least on a team, competing with others. i used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in houston, i guess that's why i like it so much. i miss being around my family, but i know that they are proud of me for being here at ut. i wanted to go back this weekend, since it's a 3 day weekend, unfortunately, i am a little behind in my classes, so i wanted to take advantage of this time to catch up and maybe get ahead a little. the reason which i am behind in my classes, which is so unlike me, is probably because i am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time. i believe that this is happening because of the long summer. well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me, which for some reason i have been avoiding. i guess because i don't want anything to do with him, i don't even consider him a good friend. just now, my friend whom which i met through hang out, a gay organization here on campus, instant-messaged me asking me to go out. he has been taking me out, to places i wouldn't even think of going, since i arrived here at ut. now him i do consider him a good friend. he is a really good guy, really fun to be around with. i don't know if i am starting to develop feelings for him, which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school. i spent last night at his house, just hanging out, talking about whatever came to our minds, and fell asleep on his bed. nothing happened, but for some reason, i sort of wanted something to. i believe that i wanted something to happen because i have been feeling very lonely these past few days, maybe because of i need a boyfriend, or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give, or not going home for the weekend. or maybe i just genuinely like him. well i guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in houston 2 days ago, and my mom is going to mail it to me, and if all goes as planned, i will be able to keep the money for myself, if financial aid allows me to. so i will use that money to pay off my bank bill. and today, my mom called, and i felt like i was there even though we are 3 hours away, which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend. right now, i don't want a boyfriend for various reasons. one, i have decided to put off sex until i get tested for hiv. i don't have suspicions that i may have it, but i have had unprotected sex, and so i just want to be sure. second, i need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me. third, i just don't know if i can handle going through what i went through with my ex all over again. not that it would necessarily happen again, but i just don't want to take the risk. or maybe i should just be brave and take a risk. i need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision.

"i just met you. how can this feeling be? it is a happy feeling. its just awkward. i haven't felt it in awhile, at least since another soul and i grew apart. things just faded. two different people, two different lives. but now the emotion lurks once more in my heart. i try to fight it, but i can't. something tells me to follow my heart, submit, and give in to the strong, enticing feeling that is just starting a war inside me. thoughts just continuously rumble through my head; they won't stop. there's no control. i can't change how i feel. this is a crazy world. everything just seems upside down. there is too much to think about in life. who ever said it would be this complicated? i wish there were just a secret to life and somebody would fill me in. i could just do anything i wanted to do. pleasure could be my sole guide down every path in this extensive journey. the thought of consequences would never even enter my mind. i could live life day by day, and my only obligation would be to live. i would just enjoy life and breathe it in. too many people today miss out on the beauty of their surroundings, the people they come in contact with and their environment. if a person merely goes through life only seeking material success, where is the true worth in that life? that person would miss out on everything with true meaning and depth. therefore, he or she is not really living but merely becoming a trained robot to fit into the machine of our material world. things are so weird now. it seems that people have lost site of their morals and are only living to climb the corporate ladder. what kind of life is that? oh well, everybody is different. what is important to me may not be important to others. i went to mount bonnel yesterday, and it was breath taking. i watched the sun set and the stars and moon come out. there was a gentle breeze that would pass over my face and lips and blow through my hair. at that moment, all stress seemed to disappear. it was complete tranquility and bliss. it made me want to just sit up on the mountain, take in the view, let my thoughts run free, and just live.

"i'm thinking about if i am going to get the job that i want at the pac at the university it would suck if i didn't i am proud that the otc called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like i didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so i can't type as fast and i keep having to go back and erase but i like pressure i thrive under it but i don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words i do not like those because i am so used to using slang that i just do not type it anymore and i also hate having to capitalize my i's it makes me mad having to go back. right now i feel a little stress because i am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday i had a meeting and i did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all i could read was biology which is another class i don't understand i never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either i feel lost in that class it is so difficult i feel like i dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not i just keep thinking about what prof. pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. like screaming i guess but the professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home i had a divided keyboard the ""flowy"" ones and now i have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment i like but i feel like i shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid i's and i forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the i messed me up again. well forget it no more caps; the i's are going to be in lower case. sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit i need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend i get to go home though i want to go to the game i have not boguht the sports package and i didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot i guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so i feel like i should go for him but i'm not going. now i get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe i'll get sick when i go home like prof. pennebaker said probably because i feel the migrane coming. i hate migranes i hate having to find a job hopefully i get a good one i have an interview on tuesday i hope it goes well and that i make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. i wonder how the bus works i keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause i have seen it once after running to the engineering building because i was late i saw the bus and i think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but i will take a look around and see if that's how it works. now i feel like i have run out of things to say i still have to do the experiment for this class i want to do the survey but since i am under 18 i have to get my moms signature and i feel like i should be happy about going home i mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like ""huh"" and i hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is ""kidnapped' i know i worry too much but i don't want anything to happen even if it means that i have to do all the homework, i've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was i talking about i don't kno, i need to make friends me and my roommate get along but i need other friends and now i have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends i saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart asian in the elevator today i feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that i have are okay but i don't really relate to them why i don't kno i feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least i hope they don't and if they do i don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still i have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really i am surprised i wrote this much i thought i was going to run out of this to say but i like this assignment when prof. pennebaker said it i was like yes no grammar rules i don't particularly like grammar but i try i mean i suck at it in my papers i always score low on it 2 minutes and i have mentioned my time too many times i tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and i did nto so now i keep talking about not because i want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts i think it is the flourescent lighting i think that is how u spell that and i just put the letter u for the word you and i am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and i keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh i thought it was over but i am going to stop now because a i don't want to talk for too long and i have to go turn of this light and i am thinking about what i just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if i should put my name at the bottom but i won't because i have the code thing. well this was productive and i did not put well in caps.

"i know so many people already, but i don't feel as that i have made that many close friends. i spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to join a fraternity, and ultimatley decided not to, and now i wonder if this was the right idea. i tried to think of both all the positive advantages and negative disadvantages of joining a frat, and came to the conclusion that it would be too time consuming. but now i see a lot of my peers invloved with greek organizations, and they seem to be having a lot of fun. all of my room'suitemates are in frats, so they talk about it and go to their activites all the time. i do not know if i made the right decision, but there is nothing i can do now because the pledge period has already started. i will have to make the best of my situation, but i am confident and hoping that it will work out. i have some very close friends fromm my hometown of fort worth who are not in fraternities, so i plan on hanging out with them a lot this semseter. to find worthwhile activites, i plan on joining some student organizations and jewish groups. i am excited about all the people here at ut, and sometimes feel intimdated about everything that is going on (especially since at my dorm, univeristy towers, a majority of the residents go greek and they are always doing something). i am an optomistic person though, and i will do anythign and everything i can to have a successful and enjoyable year in school and in austin. i am worried about a growing threat of religious fundamentalism in the world, and not only in the united states. this month, an islamic ultranationalist group bombed two u. s. embassies in africa. this same group has vowed to destroy the state of israel, which is very scary to me and for all jewish people throughout the world. osama bin-laden, leader of the terrorist group, supports and financially funds hamas, a palestinian terror organization and hezbollah, a lebanese terrorist group as well, and has the support of many muslims in the middle east. he is very popular, and will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal- the immeidate ""liberation of palestine from zionist aggression"" as he calls it, or ""total annihilation and massacrre of the free people in the secular, democratic, peace-loving state of israel"" as i see it. he sees israel as a hostile nation which should be removed from the world map. as all intelligent people know, israel is a peace seeking country that respects the rights and liberites of all its inhabitants, regardless of religion. bin-laden has growing support of his movement from his radical fundamentalist supporters, and they are the ones responsible for commiting these terrorist acts throughout the world. for instance, this week he was probably behind a nail bomb which expoded in tel aviv, injuring and killing many. also, pakistani radicals this week announced plans to overthrow the secular government and instill a new parliament based on islamic religious law. in poor middle east countries, where starvation and poverty are extremely high, people having nothing positive to look forward to, so they turn to fundamentalsim. the same movement is happening right here in the united states. some religious fundamentalist leaders, like pat robertson and ralph reed, are calling for mandatory school prayer and the inclusion of religion into public instituition. it is their intention to make the united states a christian nation by passing legislation in favor of the religious right, which happens to be wrong. the founders of our country included a seperation of church and state clause into the constitution for a purpose, and that was to keep america a secular nation. the radical right wing is trying to change this very core of our country. learning fundamentals might be good in athletics, but preaching religious fundamenalism is a dangerous threat to all of society. i commend freedom seeking nations like the united states and israel for doing their part to combat this worldwide problem, which if not stopped will affect everyone in a very horrific manner.

"well, i guess i get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. i always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. oh well, i guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. i can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since i've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. it's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. the thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. i've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. i'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should i finally start off with something healthy, i mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. that would sound good. i need to do something to keep my freshman 15 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking i do every day might work off those hamburgers. this computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and i'm now slowly falling asleep. aww man, i actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. it shouldn't be too bad. i don't even know if i'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. it's not like this is an official paper, but since i'm a perfectionist i can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. i guess it only works on aol because it's just faster to type this way. i just realized that i get off track too easily, i may have some form of add. i can barely even listen to myself talk for 20 minutes. it's really hard when i'm face to face with someone. i just can't stand in one place for that long. so, i just zone out. as i'm doing now. i'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what i write. people sometimes think i'm drunk when i'm sending them mail, like when i sent a post card to a few friends back home while i was backpacking through europe this summer with my brother. where is he by the way? oh yeah, he went to work today. i live with him, i thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. i'd always want what he had and vice versa. so, when we were in europe, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. i guess the difference here is that . um i lost my track of thought, oh yeah, that we have separate rooms so we don't have to really see each other all the time. just a moment, i need to change my posture. i'm becoming less attentive to myself. that's better. i wonder where my dog is, it's usually good to have him by my side. he is fluffy and fun to pet, well, at least he is there to substitute for my brother and keeps me company. that reminds me, i was supposed to walk him when i got home, but i haven't come around to doing that. i'll just go in 6 minutes when this is over. he can wait awhile. i wish i was a dog, he doesn't need anything but the occasional love, food, water, and he gets to sleep whenever he wants. i want to just take a while to lounge. i don't even get to do that much in the summer. i'm always active, either moving around, hanging out, or traveling. which i like a lot. oh, i forgot to ask my adviser about the study abroad program. i'm a big language freak, in french at least, after i've finished learning that i want to do italian and maybe spanish. i'm slowly losing my russian though, since my parents aren't there with me every evening to talk to. i need to move around a bit, my butt is getting sore from the chair. i need to get a new chair finally, this one just isn't doing it. twenty minutes is a lot longer than i thought, i wonder how much i've written already. it seems like my fingers haven't stopped moving for quite a while. it's a renewed sensation since i haven't played piano for a while. i need to finally get one of those too for my apartment. or else i'll forget how to do that too. it's weird how something you've done nearly your entire life can disappear so quickly. yay, only a few more seconds left to write, 10 , 8, 5, 2, 1. done ",1,"[0.266789, 0.043886, -0.805873, -0.170154, -0.20744, -0.31778, 0.097861, 0.070395, 0.577788, 0.863628, -0.15071, -0.355262, -0.184625, -1.228166, 0.111597, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.250919, -0.134164, 1.174611, 0.17476, -0.394365, -0.348706, -1.459035, 0.182847, 0.032036, 0.400685, 0.534377, -1.522175, -1.041369, -0.836334, -1.430891, -1.064784, -0.906028, -0.593462, -0.545447, -1.014051, -0.076583, -0.946189, -0.833185, 1.095239, 2.030126, -0.779151, -1.124369, -0.705982, -0.547606, -0.406012, -0.756532, -0.849534, -0.133375, -0.780158, 0.810591, 0.194643, -0.526755, -0.745092, -0.023003, -1.314344, 0.954112, -0.843266, 0.250898, 0.020984, -0.468262, -0.480161, -0.130794, -0.241279, 1.671264, -0.086094, -0.09083, 1.450981, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.400722, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, 1.398691, -0.451544, -0.408772, 0.795305, 4.606146, 3.713463, 5.04683, 4.826932, 5.029725]"

"for some odd reason, i felt really cold all day long. whether i was in my room or just walking around campus, my insides felt really cold and hollow. maybe it is due to the fact that i had to come back today. all weekend long i was at home in round rock. the thought of having to come back really annoyed and made me nervous for no particular reason. sometimes i get in this really dark mood and i imagine myself attending all these funerals, and all i can see is black and empty space. i wonder why i feel this way sometimes, but i always come out of this zone and cannot even remember what triggered me to have these images or feelings. whenever i get this way, all i see is the vision of someone dying or screaming in pain from something so horrible that cannot be explained. once, i had this dream and i witnessed what seemed like the end of the earth; i came face to face with celebrities that only i dreamed of meeting, and when someone would die, their name and accomplishments in life would be announced on an intercom. you see everyone was captured in this underground tunnel type of cave and we were all waiting for the tide to come in and take us away. as soon as i heard my name, birth date, and my few accomplishments in life, i could taste the saltwater in my mouth and that is when i woke up crying and all wet from sweat. i was really scared and curious to why i had such a dream, but i could never really comprehend what really happened, nor could my friends. some of my friends gave me back some interesting feedback, but the majority of them thought i was definitely insane. but after that weird experience, i have not had another experience like that one. the cool thing is that one of my good friends was doing an interview the next day on weird things that people experience and she interviewed me. my quote "" i witnessed the end of the world"", was in the school paper. some of her friends on the staff wanted to talk to me about my dream, but i figured since they heard everything i had to say in the paper, there was no reason for me to elaborate any further. another weird encounter i have had with near death was that in my dream, i was at my mother's funeral. the weird thing was that her death was due to cancer. well that seemed kind of odd because there was never any talk about my mother ever being sick. well in my dream, i felt so alone and cried out to her and became hysterical. i couldn't help myself. when i woke up from the dream, i was crying and i was covered all over with sweat. those two dreams are the only serious ones i've come upon. but i wonder why i have such dreams; could it be a result of my odd days when i feel dark and hollow, or is it caused by some stress factor experienced during the day sometime. i have heard that people have weird dreams when they can't sort out all their problems during the day. i am really interested in why people have odd dreams and would like to further study the factors as well as reasons that cause these events. whenever i have a dream, i hate the fact how i can never remember the following day, even though it's what wakes me up. why is it that one can have a dream and after he awakens, he can no longer remember what or who was in it. i would really like to study the causes of our dreams and the reasons why we become so disturbed, yet can remember nothing. it would be interesting if someone did an experiment on students as a project; to detect and understand maybe the basis for having dreams.

"well i am beginning this assignment and already i'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. sometimes i wonder why i care about that stuff but i really don't know, and my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which i why i think i will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because i seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when i begin to let my mind roam free. now i'm thinking why am i thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but i guess thats the idea of this experiment, and i am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that i'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then i would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and i had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and i would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that i am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as i type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and i just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but i think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in yugoslavia, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in pennsylvania, but had to move here to austin for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to austin community college, and i know this because i asked him, and i asked him because i was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. he says he likes it here in the states as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and i guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in international business, and my other roomate, troy, is a business major at ut, and i am somewhat of a business major, with my major being sports management, which is in the college of education because it is a branch of kiniesiology, which i don't know if i spelled right, but i supposed i should learn how, but anyways my major is more of a business major, like troy and djordje, which is pronounced george, so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then i have another roomate named john, whom i have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to nebraska with him, and his sister lynnsie, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in houston at the time, moved to san antonio when i was in 7th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year. i figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and i hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but i guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. but anyways, as i was saying there are 3 business majors, then john is a chemical engineer also studying at ut, and he, along with me and troy, who is 22, are all freshman, and djordje is a sophomore. i sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since troy and i have met. he seems like a very interesting person to me, and i figure i will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but i guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. speaking of parents, i hate to admit it, but i truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. before i was to leave to move in to my apartment i couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and i would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and i was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, i already missed them, and i can't wait to see them again. pretty sad on my part i guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, i just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life i was afraid of dogs, and now i see the clock and i'm running of out of time, and it said my 20 minutes are up, so thats all i have to say.

"our world is pretty fucked up. i've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with. well not the only thing, but almost the only thing. the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves. between hurricane frances and soon to be hurricane ivan, why do we need chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse. why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right. be it a christian, a muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong. so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too? ""they're religious. they're unstable. they're on medication. they've had a hard life. man fuck that. people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong. i don't understand this blur of morals and truth. how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong? i suppose i'll get off my soap box now, i just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet i know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today. the only thing i can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example. so i was just reading bush has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president. ha. that makes me laugh, i say more power to bush, he says he's clean, i believe him, i don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john kerry. i don't even want to vote, but i feel its my duty. so who am i going to vote for? its like picking the lesser of two evils? and which one is lesser of a sob than the other one? man i don't know. i suppose i'll vote for bush, being that this is texas. but i don't know if i'd feel right about that. maybe i'll just write in a vote. i mean i know all of texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter? maybe i'll run for president one day? naw, i doubt it, i'm not moderate enough. not that i'm a radical, just that i don't think i could say things to appease one person or another. i have my beliefs and damn it, i'm sticking to 'them. that doesn't mean i'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but i'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business. this feels good by the way. i'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying. i kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since i'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me. so i'll just let them be. my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently. they're a couple years older than me, and i'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her. she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together. i can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it. anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, i can tell things are getting intense. i didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically i was here first so i suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal. she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do. man, i feel sorry for them both. he just wants to love her, be there for her. and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is. love is a funny thing. love is a fucked up thing too. i've only been in love once. and i've fallen out of love once. its a painful process. but then again, i wouldn't replace it. it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that i can completely support. so why is it that humans love? or choose to love? or choose not to love? i'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling. to be able to call someone and just talk to them. see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things. i wonder what my wife will be like? i wonder when i'll meet her. my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married i think. i may be wrong, but i doubt it. i think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul. that's kind of scary. hey, my brother is going to be married forever. i'm going to have a sister in law. maybe i'll be an aunt or uncle soon. now that is really weird. its crazy how time moves. i feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time i feel like i still think and act like a 6th grader. oh 6th grade, those were good days. i thought i was the coolest kid in the world. and at the time, i may have been right. i was one cool 6th grader. it rained today. i love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure. it makes me appreciate the day that much more. i've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today. reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things i can support 100% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least. i ate at freebirds today too, that was so good. i'd say the feeling i have after i eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings i'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world. because when i've finished freebirds, i don't even desire love, because i am so full and content i don't need anything else. its a good feeling. i'm thinking about what i'm thinking about writing. if that makes sense. it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and i'm working on that, but i think that i'm thinking too much about it. i've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now i'm thinking too hard about writing something. its ok though, because i only have like 15 seconds left. maybe i'll eat cookies later tonight, i bet those will good ",1,"[0.654475, -0.151696, -0.367999, 0.032648, 0.059413, 0.733968, 0.142193, -0.0631, -0.14086, 2.181382, -0.171587, 1.106417, -1.473711, -1.016771, 0.10034, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.157617, -0.885796, -0.149721, -0.974903, -0.491404, 1.381111, -0.465414, -0.333103, -0.113933, -1.141626, 0.041596, 0.666257, 0.23533, 1.183501, -0.129779, 0.732537, -0.455772, 0.818809, -0.702683, -0.025414, -0.058201, 0.555043, -0.351092, -0.423159, 0.408149, -0.872756, 0.699429, -0.55988, 0.466576, 1.054875, 0.631079, 0.276694, 0.867148, 0.288102, -0.70984, -0.506541, -0.271737, 0.940607, -0.197827, -0.372527, -0.610195, -0.0798, -0.104574, -0.525812, -0.457379, 0.493665, 2.577914, 0.99563, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.113662, 1.720145, -0.073676, -0.23436, 1.035047, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.233535, 1.698082, -0.451544, -0.263047, 1.206101, 4.907962, 3.903341, 4.508224, 4.486816, 4.985431]"
"i am worried about my brother, bobby, right now. my mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the er. she said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. tonight i went to church with my best friend, amanda. we sang a lot, which i love. i'm not necessarily the best singer, but i really enjoy it. all the songs we sang tonight, i knew from my church at home in plano. that made me happy. i also signed up for teams at church. right now i am a little frustrated though because amanda and i are trying to do our art history homework, but the website won't let me download the article i need. very frustrating!!! oh, i need to go wash my dishes when i'm done with this. amanda and i made chili-cheese dogs. they were great!! my roommate, sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around austin alone in the dark. i have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for friday on two pieces of music that i have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. i just found out about the assignment today. school is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. all day i listened to one of the best songs i have heard in a long time called ""how could i"". the music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. i have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper i have to write is about 20 pages long. i didn't get much sleep last night because i was trying to read for art history because i don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. i woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. i won't get much sleep tonight either. amanda has music playing in the background right now, but i don't know who is singing. i like the way it sounds though. tonight i taught amanda how to tap dance. it was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and i taught her a few basics. she and i have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so i am going to teach her. she is going to teach me pointe, because i haven't done ballet in three years. i have a bad knee, and last summer i had knee surgery, so i haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. i only took tap and jazz. i miss ballet though. since i've moved to austin, i've really missed dance because i don't have a dance studio here. i would like to go take some classes, but i think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and i can just practice at home. i bought new pointe shoes the other day. we had to walk many many miles to get them. today in geology class, we played football and sang the ut fight song standing up with the ""hook 'them"" sign in the air. it was a very interesting class. right now i wonder if anyone has imed me on aim. i'm really tired, but i won't be able to sleep tonight because i need to do school work. my parents might go to the bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully i may go as well. i haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. that reminds me, i miss my family in virginia. maybe i can fly out there this summer. that would be fun. virginia is beautiful. the chesapeake area especially. i'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. but he will be fine. i cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (i have to do chores around the house because i live in a co-op). tomorrow i think i'm going to sleep in between classes. i only have two discussion sections. sijia just got home!!

"it was an awesome meal went to chuys. the best chicken enchiladas i have ever had. my friend jay came to visit out of the clear blue. just showed up at my door today. i was pretty excited about seeing him. i really miss san antonio. i miss my family a lot. talked to my mom today. she says how much they all miss me there and how empty the house is without me. whatever. i'm the one in a claustrophobic dorm room living with a complete stranger. at least they still have each other. i'm the one on my own. don't get me wrong, i love the freedom of living on my own, it's just a little bit hard to make the transition at first. especially if you're as close to your family as i am. all of my really close friends are at a&m. that's weird. my two best friends from the first grade(we all used to live on the same street)go to school there and complain that they miss me. at least they are together. i have a lot of friends here and a lot of people i know(i never run out of things to do)but it just isn't the same. don't have that bond with other friends. oh, well. make new friends but keep the old. i met a really cool girl the other day. she's in my rtf class. man, that class is so huge 500 people! i'm so worried about doing well in that class cause it's my major and i really want to make an a in there. the ta said that none of us would do as well as we think we will on the first test. great. that makes me feel good about it. it is really interesting, though. i hope i picked the right major, though. it's such a competitive field. i want to do really well. not just push a camera around for big stars for the rest of my life. i want to be one of the big stars. that would be a dream come true. wow. i don't even really know what i want to do with my degree yet. sometimes i think that that's cool and that i'm only 18 and i don't need to know all of that stuff just yet. then again, i'm in school and my parents are paying a lot of money for my education. i don't want to disappoint them and become one of those drifters who can't decide what they want to do until they have already been in college for like, ten years and by then they're too old to get a really awesome job anyway cause all the younger, smarter kids are getting them first. that would not be good. then i think, i'm dwelling on it entirely too much and i should just enjoy college, get the education i came here for and get on with my life. just sort of go with the flow. i don't normally stress out, but when i sit alone and actually think about it for a while, it all becomes sort of scary. you know, where i am in life. where i am going. where am i going? that's the hard part(and it's sort of exciting)is not knowing the future. not knowing what is going to happen from day to day. we just take life as it comes. i have a class at nine in the morning . it is so freaking hard to wake up for that class every monday, wednesday, and friday. i'm really proud of myself cause i haven't missed a single day of class yet. a lot of people i know have been skipping out. it's so easy to do. but not me. even when it was pouring rain outside, i still went to class. soaking wet. i'm so concerned about doing well.

"psychologists. always trying to understand how the mind works, and how it doesn't work in some cases. can such things be understood, or are we merely deluding ourselves that knowledge of any kind can be attained? i guess i've always found psychology to be a very pretentious field. though an interesting one. we all want to control our lives, and anticipating the actions and desires of others helps us maintain that facade of control. perhaps i'm getting into a more philosophical realm at the moment, but that is where my thoughts take me. is free will merely an illusion? i've thought about this a lot. unfortunately there are no definitive answers to this or other questions. is there a god? i've never heard a logically sound argument for the existence of a god. i allow for the possibility of a deity, but it certainly wouldn't be the christian god. i think ultimately that i have to agree with the existentialists. there is no proof for or against the existence of a god, so we should stop wasting time speculating and just deal with this life. few people can deal with that. our fear of death makes us create religions, so that we can pretend there is some semblance of life after our earthly bodies die. these are not new thoughts, i'm just thinking on demand; my mind moves most easily to the pathways it knows, and i present some of the more coherent ideas here. is someone actually reading this? do you understand that i am human? i am not an object. i am in a body, but i am not the body alone. i am a mind, vast and complex. i am. do you feel superior because you can analyze minds? i ask you this, so that you can ask yourself. do you enjoy treating people as objects? do you even admit in your conscious mind that you treat people as objects? perhaps not. it's possible that i'm being slightly unfair to you and your profession. still, it is good to raise questions. we are all just a bit too complacent and easily controlled. i see the need for religion, but i think many of us are above that. i don't need to buy my morality from someone else. what moralists and philosophers do i respect? plato, for his logic. kierkegaard, except the theism. kant, for his explications of metaphysics and epistemology. nietzsche, except at the end of his days. lavey, except for his dependence on rituals and his arrogance. psychologists and behavioral scientists? i stay away from most. at some point i'll get back into it, but i was just too turned off by freud and his pretentious assumptions. other reading? fiction, lots of it. i would name a few dozen authors but then why subject myself to the judgments of someone i can't even see. music. i find music to be very important. you can't get by without music. and you can't just listen indiscriminately either. i think a real understanding of notes, rhythms, chords, and instrumentation is required before one can say anything about any kind of music. do you understand music? how are you reacting to my questions? you must be used to asking the questions instead of having someone else ask them. are you getting anything out of this? is this more interesting than most responses to the same assignment, or do you even care? are you turning to a colleague and saying ""hey, this kid was actually making a futile attempt to understand my motives. "" fun with role reversals! i considered producing a surreal and rambling narrative for this assignment, but then you might have taken that a bit too seriously (""bob, we got another wacko here""). ah well, time passes and other pursuits await. goodbye for now.

 right now i am sitting at the computer feeling very good that i am finally doing this assignment. it had been on my mind ever since it was assigned. i can't wait till i am done. because i know i will feel a sense of accomplishment . ever since the lecture on tuesday every time i think i can picture that video we saw in class where the part of the brain was warming up or so called cooking. i imagine my brain is cooking right now trying to think of what to write next. earlier today i found my emotions changing alot today and i tried to figure out why they changed so much at one point i was extremely shy and the next minute i was outgoing. right now i feel very comfortable with myself and extremely confident. my thoughts are going every which of way right now. because i feel pressure to do well in school from myself and my parents. i really would like to please them and show them i am responsible and smart. i feel as though it is not me right now. i find it truly fascinating that my mind is coming up with some of these things right now. i find it really intriguing. now even after going to class i really feel like hearing the lectures really has made me realize alot of stuff i had not noticed before especially trying to feel what i really feel not what i just think i feel. it just occurred to me that i have not looked up once to see how much time has gone by. i could write this for a while just tracking my different thoughts and feelings and emotions. when i mentioned something earlier about my parents and how i wanted to impress them. i pictured my parents and started having feelings of love because i know they are there for me if i need them. i never have stopped and traced my thoughts before until now. i am wondering now if the tests are going to be hard in this class. i feel pretty hungry right now so i can imagine my stomach relaying something to my part of my brain telling me it is time to eat. i wish i could get controller the part of my mind that controls addiction because i sure would like to quit smoking. i feel as if i have no control over it anymore. when i smell cigarettes smoke. i feel my mind say wouldn't it be nice to have one of those. i guess quitting smoking is telling that part in your mind no and to be stronger than that. that was weird how my mind suddenly brought up smoking i guess because i know i have to quit because it is so bad for you. well that's time i really enjoyed this assignment. ,0,"[0.602538, -0.291276, -0.189043, -0.6514, -0.060235, 0.351424, 1.282173, -0.261111, -0.648166, -0.707832, -0.119897, -0.590446, 0.005537, 1.336523, 1.767231, 0.0, -0.04277, 1.190564, 1.774485, -0.46317, 1.747492, -0.096589, -0.636696, 0.636236, -0.624052, -1.727562, 0.361819, -0.497193, -0.823241, -0.044319, -0.120817, 0.96055, -1.133606, 0.252569, -1.017959, -1.109326, 2.582074, 2.623399, 1.642514, -0.780322, 6.089156, -0.342341, -0.360669, 3.645992, 0.360699, 0.303826, 5.285156, -1.163553, -0.021248, -0.882212, -1.34699, 1.911189, 0.886763, 0.172235, -0.518558, -0.901782, 0.504935, -0.954251, -0.693745, -1.180643, -0.423761, 1.340398, -0.480161, -0.175133, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.292692, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.37208, -0.337085, -0.422267, -1.426902, -0.451544, -0.033792, -1.554528, 5.098384, 3.634123, 4.75853, 5.07553, 4.064421]"
"what am i thinking? well, i'm sitting in my dorm room alone right now. it's quite relaxing actually. my roommate has been rushing all week and finally decided what sorority she will join yesterday. she joined alpha xi delta. when i returned to my humble abode last night i found our room decorated by her sorority sisters. the room looked really nice except for the balloons that made it cumbersome to walk. my roommate is nice. i didn't know her before we came here. it has been a good experience getting to know her and living with someone. i have never lived with anyone in such close quarters before. i think it's good for a person. it makes you realize just how many things you do that you don't even think about. i have to be so conscious of all the things i do so as not to disturb my roommate. that's enough talk about my roommate. i am thoroughly enjoying my freshman year at college so far. i am taking 12 hours and my classes actually seem to be interesting. i think it's amazing how much you grow up and change without even realizing it. looking back over my life i have seem myself change. i think for the better. i have always been a lifeguard during the summer to get some extra cash. last summer i managed a pool at a country club. i never thought i would be able to have anyone respect my authority and me. my lifeguards did what i told them too and the summer turned out great. i saw how i had to mature to be the leader where i had always been the follower previously. i just think it's amazing how you go through experiences and change because of them. that is what i am hoping to get out of college; an experience that will forever change me. i am dating a sophomore here at the university. we have been dating for a little over a year. i was extremely excited about coming to college this year because of the time we will share. last year we had to do the whole longdistance relationship thing. it was really hard and expensive between trips and phone cards. his parents also do not allow him to date in college because of academic reasons. he is not a bad student, but they want him to have zero distractions. i don't know how they can honestly think that he will have zero distractions at college, but who am i to argue? all last year that left us with the task of hiding our relationship. we both really, really like what we have together and are nowhere near wanting to give it up. we made the commitment to work through this. it is much easier now that we are at the university because his parents can't watch over him all the time. he just left my room. we were watching my roommate's television. he is a baseball freak so we were watching baseball highlights. it was relaxing at the least. over all i had a good first day at college. the only thing that didn't go smoothly was finding my first class. it was in building llb, the hardest building to find on campus. i did eventually find it after asking about 15 different people. our class was locked outside for about ten minutes though. the teacher didn't have a key. we did get in to our room after a few short minutes. i am quite amazed that i could write this much in just barely 20 minutes. i would maybe be inclined to write more, but i am extremely tired and i have to get up for my next set of classes tomorrow. i know this sounds like kissing up, but i am truly interested in this class. i hope i learn many interesting things.

"i just always feel like i am better off when i get things done. i have found that i have been procrastinating a lot lately and i just want to get things back into order so i can do more fun things. i was happy about passing by the ut tennis club booth on my way back from class, i am hoping to have time to do that. i really wish i talked to the ut tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do i like tennis, but i am happy bec it will give me a workout. i don't have much time to go to the gym now and i really want to work out more often. i picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe i will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying i have to do takes up more time than expected, i just feel like i don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight i had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and i just wanted to leave so i could do more imprt things with my time. but i know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec i will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when i went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now i am worried i wont get a spot in a study and i will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since i already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. i will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since i am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then i will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, i should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time i got to register, since i was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. i should have come to an earlier one but i didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so i had to go to the later one, oh well. at least i got classes that are required, i can't get everything i suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone i know, from my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and i kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though i do miss pewople a lot, i think i am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since i was accepted, i felt like it was a good opportunity and i shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why i came all the way from miami, florida to texas and i always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. i was just admiring today the fountains - i love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that i have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where i live. those people scare me, and i know i have nothing to be scared of i just don't like seeing them there. anyway, i am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. i hope they have a great trip an safe. i am always worried abt them, i just don't want anything to happen to them. i know my mom is scared of flying and i just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that i got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever i think abt that trip i think abt how i wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips i still did it, i guess i thought they wouldnt care if i did it. that's funny. i guess i am still bitter i didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but i am happy at ut. i hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 50 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 80 - i love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. i miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but i havent gotten it yet, i should call her. but i havent talked to her inso long i think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe i will one day, i guess i should to say thank you when the present comes. or i could send a card, whatever. i will decide later, if it ever gets here!!

" i want some ice cream. i will go get some as soon as i finish typing this. i wonder is someone is reading this because otherwise how can the computer analyze this? tomorrow is going to be a busy day. too much studying to do. maybe i should have done this on friday morning. oh well, i procrastinate too much so maybe this is a good thing. gosh twenty minutes is a long time, especially when you are waiting to go get ice cream! i'm not even hungry, but i haven't had ice cream is so long. why do the guy floors in this building keep serenading? seems kind of odd that guys would do that for strangers. i like my room. it's very colorful, but i would still like to add more decorations. perhaps more butterflies because it is a unique touch. gosh, only a quarter done. i want my ice cream!!! aww i can hear people yelling. how annoying. i would study in the library, but it seems kind of scary. this morning was scary. yeah, i am never going to run by myself anywhere at 4:30 in the morning. i don't know if i want to make texas crew or not. it seems really cool and i got a rush just from exercising this morning, but on the other hand, it is also tiring, expensive, and i have to go through the trouble of finding a ride every day so i won't have to walk all the way to first street again. hmmm, i'm having trouble thinking of stuff. oh i did not like today's quote of the day . it had something to do with god making the earth round. i wanted to erase it, but i figured that might be a little rude. the sign should say monica's quote of the day since i don't really care and i don't choose which ones go up there. i should have a drawing of the day or something silly like that. yeah, maybe of the week so i won't have to do so much. i prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. man sometimes i am so evil, but deep down i believe i am good. oh my goodness, i am only halfway done. do i have to keep writing like this? i'm not sure if i really think about stuff this often. i may be just searching for topics to write about. kind of like small talk, which by the way i cannot stand, partially because i am no good at it. i can't wait until this weekend's field trip to port aransas! i havent been on a field trip since like elementary school. well, on a good field trip. maybe that's because there is nowhere interesting to go in texas, er houston. this weekend is going to be so much fun, hopefully. i like a lot of the women in natural sciences girls. a couple of the white girls seem kind of cocky though. like my next door neighbor. she is never smiling, and she only comes over to talk if she wants something, such as markers. she came over the other day to ask for markers because she didn't want to use her sharpies because she said they would run out. um, okay. so it's okay if other people's stuff runs out? geez, and i see her talking to the professors alot trying to suck up. she annoys me already. whoohoo only a minute and a half left! that's really what i'm thinking. also i want to play ping pong downstairs with edwina and athena, but i probably don't have time because i procrastinated this weekend. dang it. okay i will just wait for the time to run out. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. . 5. . 4. 3. 2. 1. yay ",1,"[-0.548799, -0.143687, -0.50344, -0.077877, -0.256389, 0.680301, -0.003273, -0.707878, -0.268548, -0.003515, -0.229375, 0.241218, 0.27779, -1.380022, 0.124246, 0.0, -0.04277, -1.520383, -0.937383, -0.795527, -1.203241, -0.508983, -0.367024, 0.461182, 2.081646, 0.601919, 0.044968, 0.936837, -0.222086, 0.544104, -0.392309, -0.393769, -0.73931, -0.906028, 0.405468, -1.109326, 0.422738, 1.08865, -1.011953, 0.769065, 0.678623, 0.88253, -0.833077, -0.815354, -0.782543, 0.32584, -0.786121, -0.930522, -0.302782, -0.837422, 0.680427, 0.278955, -0.56783, 0.22902, 0.221681, -0.242238, 0.047684, 0.325575, -0.631881, -0.816074, 0.909389, -0.992871, -0.027354, -0.745201, -0.136999, 3.646195, -0.086094, 0.745217, 0.596275, 0.073095, -0.23436, 0.503301, 0.759541, -0.337085, -0.422267, 0.386382, -0.451544, -0.408772, 0.897646, 4.314372, 3.916951, 4.494604, 4.263443, 4.686317]"

"what do i write about? that is a good question, but i guess i should write about writing, or think about thinking. the thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued i am at the moment. i have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and i just want to sit and do nothing. i guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. jimmy buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. i wish i were sleeping and i wish i did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because i just want to do nothing right now. i don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. i did not have much class today, so i got to sleep in, but i could still use some rest. perhaps i need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. i just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. i have been in school here for about two weeks, and i think it is really quite a cool set up. you don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in psychology, only my other classes. the biggest adjustment i think from high school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. one of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. that guy is such a mess and i was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. it is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. i am trying to search for thoughts, but i just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. all of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville. "" i wish i were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. we have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around austin. but now my hands are kind of aching because i don't think i have ever typed this long without taking a break. i am certain that i wil have great stamina in my hands when i am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. it is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. i like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. i look up at the clock and see i am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. i feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which i have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. this writing is not so painful as i though because i was sure that i would just go braindead and have nothing to say. i do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. looks like i am out of time.

"being at cllege is a new experience for me and i think that it is giving me a sence of being dependant on myself. i like all the new freedom that i have gotten, but i also am homesick a lot. i miss my parents and being in my house in houston. there isn't anyone to make sure that i do everything that i am supposed to do. i am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that i am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, i am getting worried and that is gettting me scared. i have a lot of thing s that i need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. it makes me very frustrated and annoyed at the same time. i feel like i should be a lot more organized and up to date with everything. i am a very organized person, even a ""neat feak,"" and that is why it's driving me crazy when i am behind. i think that if i work hard, then i will do alright. last weekend, i went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so good to be home. i was able to go driving around and i knew where everything was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that i just need time to settle into ut, and then i will be in more control. austin is never going to be ""home"" for me, but it will be a place that i can come to enjoy. i don't think that any city can compare to houston because that is where i grew up and that's also where i have all of my family and friends. sometimes i think about how life would be like if i was adopted or even if one or both of my parents were dead. i look back and don't think that i could manage. my parents play a very important role in my life and i don't think that i would be the same person that i am without them. i know a lot of people that have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough times and they are doing well now, and i give them so much strenght and poer for being able to do that. if my mother would pass on, i think that i would really go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that i would become very quiet when usually i am very outgoing and lively. many things don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. i usually don't cry in movies, and i don't care to become very emotional all the time. i have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. no matter how depressing the news, i am unable to show my emotions. that is something that i think that i get from my parents, specifically my mother. i think that i have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical qualities from my father. i think that i am able to be the person that i am because of my parents. they helped shape me into the person that i am. there are friends that i have been close to in high school, and ever since i have come to ut, i have not been as close to. i don't know the reason for the change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have not tried as hard to keep in touch. i have heard that things like this happen and that you make all of your really good friends in college. i know what people say, but i have a really good friend at trinity and me and her have keep in touch really well. i think that she is an exception to the ""rule.

" i wonder why i am so depressed. i don't know if depressed is the word i should be using, but i am down on myself because i am a freshman in college and i feel like everyone is way better than me. i didn't do well on the math portion of the sat test, so i needed a waiver to get into a ut math class. i wanted to take pre-calculus, but the math advisor didn't think i could handle it. so now i'm wondering if i really can or can't. i mean i thought i could because i took pre-cal in high school and did exceptionally well, but now i'm all confused. am i really smart like i thought i was? or did my brain turn to mush over the summer and i can't even hold a decent conversation now? i don't even think i belong here at ut. i think i only got accepted because i was in the top 10% of my high school class. i hope i do well. i feel like i'm going to fail and drop out. i really want to hang in there, but it's hard with 50,000 people, plus other colleges throughout the world. i know that's life, but i can't help feeling this way about myself. i feel like no one cares, and the only person i can really trust and depend on is my boyfriend of 4 yrs. i love hector! he's always been there for me and continues to be. i'm lucky to have him. college is confusing. i can't believe i dropped out of their business school. but i figured if i wanted to pursue a career in the health field, i made the right decision. i just don't know what i want to do though. everyone keeps saying that the first 2 yrs of college don't matter because you're just taking your basic courses, but i think it does matter because certain field have prerequisites and you don't want to waste your electives on things that won't apply to what you want to become. but what do i want to become?? i really hope i go the right direction because i do not want to waste thousands of dollars on a major i won't even pursue or enjoy. i either want to become an occupational therapist, dental hygienist, or physical therapist. i think physical therapy is too hard though. right now i'm leaning more towards occupational therapy, so i hope i actually go through with everything. i keep hearing statistics of how a lot of freshman drop out, and i hope i am not so completely lazy to the point where i'm one of those freshman. i know my boyfriend hector will make it because he's in the tip program and has a lot of encouragement. but i am going to have to provide myself my own encouragement because i know nobody else cares about my standings. i need to start getting involved in community services and activities like everyone recommends. i don't understand how some people have time to be into everything, hold a job, and handle school at the same time. that is almost impossible for me. they are truly talanted. i think the homework itself is too much work. i hope i don't get fat. ever since i graduated and stopped being in drill team, i feel way more lazy and i gained 6 lbs. i exercised a whole lot this summer and have not lost an ounce. i feel like everything i worked for in the summer meant nothing because i have nothing to show for it. i hope my boyfriend still loves me in return because i see so many pretty girls in college hoping hector will not fall for them. he says he loves only me, but i am hesitant to believe him. i would be very sad if he left me because we have so much together. but then again he's always been such a wonderful boyfriend and i should have no reason to doubt him. i know i should be less insecure about myself but it's hard. i tell myself to do one thing and it's like i don't even follow my own orders. hey, my cell phone is ringing. i wonder who it is. probably angela. i miss her. ever since she moved to arizona i don't have anyone to hang around with. come to think of it i haven't had a true friend since my sophomore year in high school. it's always been just me and hector with no one else to call my best friend. angela was my best friend until she found a boyfriend. but she's still my best friend and i love her to death. i came into college with intentions of meeting new people and finding new friends, but i haven't had any luck so far. the only thing close to a friendship was on friday at the union when some guy who recognized me from his sociology class invited me to bowl with him. i would have but i didn't have any socks, so i watched instead. he was cute, but i feel guilty for thinking he's cute and having a boyfriend at the same time. i also feel guilty because sometimes i find myself attracted to the same sex. i don't know if i'm attracted to them or if i just want to be like them. i'm confused. but i try not to let it get to me. i'm curious about a lot of things, but it's hard to try any of them because my parents are way overprotective! other adults say my parents are always right and that i'll understand them one day. i am very grateful that i have such caring parents, but sometimes i wish they would ease up on me. i hate when they try to pick my friends for me and forbid me to hang out with certain people because of their sexuality or the way they choose to live their life. i think i should pick my own friends. the people i used to hang around with were just fine. they didn't engage in drugs or anything. i liked them for them and my parents could not see what i saw. it's like they expect my friends to be perfect for them and do not consider the way i feel at all. it's frustrating!! even though i'm 18 i don't feel like it all. my parents still treat me like i'm 14 and cannot think for myself. i just wish there was some way to get them to see things my way. i've already tried talking to them one on one, but they do not listen to me what-so-ever. they have a one track mind and feel that everything they say is right. i keep telling myself that one day it'll all change, but i'm scared that it may never change. i used to argue with my parents all the time because we shared a difference in opinion, but after a while i realized there is just no winning with them. i don't really tell them how i feel anymore because it's not like they're going to listen to me anyway. it's like they have to hear it from an adult rather than myself. even then, they'd probably go with their own judgement anyway.

"okay. i'm in the stupid smurf lab. there are so many people here. i saw brian downstairs. sometimes he worries me. he met a new guy the other day and already had sex with this guy. i don't know if he used protection or not. but it worries me. he's so. so. spontaneous about things. i don't ever really know if he thinks things through. he just does as he pleases which isn't a bad thing. but it can be dangerous. i wish he'd just look at himself and what he's doing and decide if it's the right or wrong thing to do. he doesn't need to be going around having sex with whomever whenever. he knows and i know that he's a whore. it's not a surprise to anyone. but, he doesn't care. so it seems. of course, i call him a whore jokingly but in a way i'm serious about it. he knows what can happen to him and it sucks that he doesn't care. man. men!!! men suck! josh needs to realize that i will never be with him again. he thinks things will change. he's so wrong. for two years i had to put up with his shit and all his lies. there is no way in hell i'd ever even give a second thought to going back out with him. he knows he's an asshole and i let him know that a long time ago. how dare he even bring up the idea of us getting back together. he's a 12 year old trapped in a 24 year old's body. he has no idea what a good relationship is and he doesn't know the meaning of trust. he needs to grow up and realize that he can't always get what he wants. and when he can't get it he needs to just give up and move on with his pointless life. i've moved on and he needs to realize that. i'm not there to be at his beck and call and i'm not there to just be there when no one else is. he lost whatever respect i had for him a long long long time ago. why is it that i always seem to get stuck in the worst situations when it comes to relationships? hell. let's see my record thusfar: hmmm, josh is the asshole, jay was just a jerk, seth is the only man i ever loved and he's in california, craig was someone that i could consider a ""summer love"". but he's at another college. well, screw it!! i need to concentrate on getting all a's and b's this year so i can get that free plane ticket to anywhere in the us. plus, i get $50'a!! i need the money. i'm poor now and i have bills to pay! damnit all to hell. bills!!! responsibility!! yeah, i have responsibilities as an adult but i don't think the 'rents realize that. i'm 19 years old. 20 in april. yet i'm still a little girl who can't do anything right for shit according to them. what the hell do they know? i'm not living with them now and they don't see how hard i work to get where i am and how hard i try to be social, to get the education i need, and to get a job worth having in this freakin' town!! it's hard to find a job. but i've done it. and what do they say when i tell them this? ""that's nice"". what is that? why don't they just tell me how they really feel. ""oh, well, that's still not the real world so it doesn't count"" i swear they piss me off. my mom is the worst. she wants to lecture me about dishonesty and all that shit. well, hello! guess who's fixin' to eat her words!! i caught her smoking this past weekend. yep. right there by the side of the house puffin' away like a chimney. what was that you said mom? you quit smoking? right. and i was so proud of you! all that's blown to hell now. so, i caught her. and what did miss ""liane, i can't trust you"" do? well, she decides to kiss my ass to try and make up for her lie. yes sir! she bribed me with four 60-minute phone cards and $50. oh and she even told me that i could just pay for my speeding ticket without having to take the class. . yes, that means it would go on my record but ""oh, that's okay. it's not much more on your insurance. besides, we just got a load of money back from the insurance company because of our good driving records"". oh yeah. she was brown-nosing big time. i have lost a lot of respect for her for doing that. i don't know whether i should just forget about it and let her do what she will or tell my dad and have him deal with it. i swear. this world is nothing but a big mass of contradictions! i'm not saying that i'm perfect. but i've learned over the past few years about what i want out of life and what i don't want. i'm living my life the way i want to. as stress-free as possible and as happy as possible. when i'm put into these stupid situations it just makes life that much harder and it sucks! i'm so tired of looking at this computer screen. i think it's about time for me to stop thinking. yep. it is about that time. thank god. now i have to go help brian with his spanish work that he swore was gonna be ""soooo easy"". i knew he'd have trouble. and i knew he would turn to me. i'm no bilingual. but what the hell. i do what i can to help my friends out. i've been called ""too nice""? how the hell can someone bee ""too nice""?????????

"i forgot that we were going to be timed, i wonder if we have to type well, i wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. this is kind of harder than i thought. so should i go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? oh well, i don't think i will. i'll just keep going. i need to keep typing about something. i need to type what i'm feeling. i'm feeling a little stressed because i have to keep typing all this time. i wonder how long this should be, especially if i have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. it's only been three minutes. geez! i thought this was going to be an easy assignment. well, it is relatively easy. it's just different from what i expected. i wonder if sarah and christen have gone to bed yet. i never know how late they stay up because i'm always. oh my phone is ringing! but i can't pick it up because i have to keep typing. oh well. they can wait. i bet it's larry. i still haven't met him. but liz said he wasn't even that cute. he is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. i need to call jennie and make sure we can all go out on friday night. my shoulder is sore. i wish i was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. that would be so nice. i can't believe i ate those tiffany's treats cookies. i hate that. it takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. but then i just come home and waste all of the calories i burned off on cookies. i wonder why i get those cravings for sweets. i keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. i'm running around the track in such pain. i really hate to run. well, i guess i don't hate it. it does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. but while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! it takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. i wonder who is actually going to read this? i hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. i don't know if that even makes sense. natalie, my friend at byu wrote that today in her email. i have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. i feel that way mostly because i lack the. see i can't even think of the words. i lack the ability to think of the words. the bottom line is i need to work on my vocab because i just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike natalie. however, i did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while i was getting my school supplies. i realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. but then ironically when i finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, i couldn't find them in my dictionary! i never look words up because i just lacked the motivation and then when i finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! it just goes to show that i can try but i'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. maybe i need to read more. i need to read the newspaper everyday. i hated hearing that i had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. my neck still hurts. i need a massage. i would love to just get massages all the time. that would be so nice. i only have two minutes left. it feels like i haven't been typing for very long. i think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. i still can't type very fast. almost done. 30 seconds. wow this is a long 10 seconds.

"whenever i do assignments like these, i usually seem to write over the required time. i've always been more of a thinker than a talker. i seem to possess the strange habit of going into such deep thought that i am completely oblivious to my surroundings, something that really annoys both my sister and boyfriend. i guess i don't really feel the need to always take part in hincty conversation taking place around me. at the moment i'm wondering if i'm supposed to go to the next line while writing or if i'm supposed to keep writing in one straight line like this. the screen seems to just be going to the right when i type instead of ending and going to the next line. right now i am listening to morrissey. i can hear it from the bedroom- i'm sitting in the living room which attaches to the kitchen. when i walked into this apartment for the first time ever, it had a much different feel to it than it does now. this is eric's apartment, my boyfriend, and it feels bigger than when i saw it for the first time. i'm typing on his computer-wow, i finally went to the next line-because my laptop has seen nothing but endless problems from when i first got it. my fingers are feeling numb while typing- he keeps it so cold in here. he's gone to run errands for a couple of hours so this felt like the perfect time to work on this assignment. psychology has always interested me. i went to visit tcu and sat in on a psychology class and never before had a class interested me as much as this one did. actually, i think it was at hendrix. i couldn't stop talking to my mom about it. but that's not really the field i want to go into. i really want to go into early-childhood education. while in that class, the professor showed a film of schizophrenia where one example was a woman who, in one stage of her mind, became an infant and when she cried, the whole class was shocked by how much she actually sounded like a baby. i have no regret that i choose ut. i love austin and i'm not the kind of person to let 500-people classes bother me. i can't help but feel like while writing this i should focus more on my emotions or something- glancing back over this i realize how boring this is and i apologize to the reader. it doesn't seem to me that my thoughts are usually this shallow and simple but then again, when i'm thinking to myself, my thoughts are not usually this clear-cut. they're usually one huge mass of ideas and vibes i receive from my surroundings. well, once again i think i've gone a bit over my time limit so i'll stop now. i'm glad this is graded on completion and not depth.

"i have way too much to do this week i am never going to get all of it done it's amazing that i have this 20 min to do this one assignment it is a good thing that the deadline was postponed today in class. ryan who lives in my dorm is in my class, that is cool, now i have someone to sit with. i need to study, i need to sleep, i fell asleep in the laundry room today. that's poor. at least my laundry's done. tonight i have to be in my room at 10 because my sailor sis is going to come do something to me or something. i am glad i'm here instead of home. home sucks. it is fun here and believe it or not less stressful maybe not less stressful but definietley less depressing. i'm hungry but i have ot wait until 6:15. i also have to go take reality bites back to that girl that suzanne knows who lives on my floor. i wish kim didn't have another one of those damn mixers so she could study with me tonight, i have a mixer tomorrow when she will want to study. i better clean my room i bet my roomate thinks i am a pig. oh well get used to it. man, i've only been writing a little while. psy is a good class though. no i'm not sucking up. i like it it's interesting and lightly entertaining. bad time of day though-during when i want ot take a nap. wed. is a long day, when is the weekend coming again? oh how i've missed the weekend. my stomach hurts, not from hunger but from ab machines. i just noticed that when i sneezed just now. i need to keep the discipline up with those ab machines though there is nooo way that i'm gaining the freshmen fifteen. i've actually lost five lbs. according to the scale back in dallas. maybe that is because i don't eat as much because the food sucks. i'm actually eating more down here because i'm not depressed anymore. in dallas, after my dad's death i couldn't eat. we sort of talked about that today in class--stress can shut down the stomach because we can live off of glucose in our livers--and i am sure that is what happened to me this summer. so maybe i should perceive my hunger as a lack of stress. perhaps that is the optimistic point of view--perhaps that is the lazy ignorant point of view. whatever my arms hurt, i'm tired of typing. i kind of like this form of writing you know where i can just say anything. is this like therapy or something? i always thought this was the kind of stuff therapists make their patients do. the next assignment is probably to draw a picture or something. something that expresses my ""feelings"". enough sarcasm. i feel like i have to burp maybe i drank to much coke. at least i won't go through withdrawal. i wish ryan wouldn't go play basketball before we eat--i'm hungry. maybe i'm just bored. lots of people say that overeaters just eat when they are bored because they cannot think of anything else to do. jeopardy is on. i got a free t shirt last night at gregory becuase they were filming college jepardy or someting. it looked like a few geeks in front of a camera just standing there with loud music. i never actually figured out what is going on . hey that is cool ryan just called and wants to eat. it is a shame i have to keep writing this for 10 more minutes. no wait five more. yes. i kind of like this its cool. i got nop email today. that pisses me off. i love email. the only thing in the real mail today was some anonymous letter about a credit card or some kind of bs like that. i already have a credit card. phone is ringing again. food its almost time for food. i wonder why ryan didn't play basketball. maybe he did. nah he wouldn't do that for 15 min. it probably sounds like i care a lot about ryan but i don't that is my friend's man. kim's man. he is crazy about her. it is all good though he is a nice guy and they go together weell. college rules. i think the water here in austin infected my bellybutton ring though. it's been oozing ever since i got here. i haven't changed the way i'm taking care of it but i don't know. hey i only have a little time left. because i started at 5:10 and now the clock ahs just turned to 5:30 this is me signing out.

" ok, i'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since i've been told i type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of mark's mind. i hope that no one reads this seriously at all. ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. that was fast, i'm telling you this is a waste of time and i'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. i'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. i miss my wife. yeah that's right my wife. we aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and i do. i certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because i actually do take it very seriously. i love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. now i'll write about pizza hut. they got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than i will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. i know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and i will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. i hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children i will do whatever i can to ensure this. i love my wife so much. i miss her terribly. there seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how i have many a time disputed the reality of free will. how can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. because if i had full free will i could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that i would be judged for my actions on earth. but since i couldn't choose whether or not i could be exposed to such information. i am a catholic. this is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. but the truth is that i consider myself a part of this religion yet i do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. for example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. my idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this: good people go to heaven. bad people go to hell. simple right? except what i qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. so what now? is my idea of good right or is theirs. but wait, the plot thickens. i have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. you see i believe that god instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. the most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something i find to be unacceptable i can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. i am almost always right in this aspect. every time i have seen something i think is wrong i can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. however, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. the hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. i am not proud of all that i've done in my life. the only reason i can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because i apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. i once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. one of the worst days of my life. there is no reason i can use to explain my actions. but i did it to end the relationship. yeah, i know what you're thinking. good job huh? well she didn't want to leave anyway. at least that was what i thought. i was so damn confused. i cheated on her, a rule i set for myself a long time ago was that i would never cheat on a girlfriend. and i did. i disgraced myself and i hate. er hated myself for it. i did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. should an infraction upon the rule about never cheating on my girlfriend i must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. i don't know if i'm wrong. but i could be. man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. now i'm listening to damien rice. the little known writer of some of the best music i've ever heard. i think he's great. it's kind of weird i guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but i do. i also like this guy joseph arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. i love the way i can relate to it. i recently read ""a streetcar named desire"". the female role of blanche. she is like my ex. she lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want"" never tell me what i want. only i know that and i don't appreciate being told. if anyone ever makes assumptions about who i am before i meet them. i get reasonably angry but i hide it pretty ok. you. for some reason i have been descrimanated against for being mexican twice in my life. both times by a girlfriends family. i have an extraordinarily pale complexion. the funny thing about that is one of them is mexican. heh what can i say.

"okay, i've begun writing. one thing i should probably point out as i recall the above statement about disregarding grammar is that i spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as i type are second nature to me, so it's not like i've gone back and fixed all the errors. which doesn't mean that there probably aren't any run on sentences in here. okay. that's been said. right now my roommate is being fairly loud. i find that bothersome. i'm not sure if he's stupid or inconsiderate. i'd rather be at home right now. i was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now i'm having trouble getting the motivation to do anything. it made the summer more fun at the time, but it was maybe not such a good idea. ideas are like that because of that whole 20'20 hindsight thing. i'm looking at the vents on the side of my computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gills. i'm not looking forward to having to do the other writing assignment. which is not to say i think it'll be difficult, but this assignment requires almost no discipline. the other one will require me to have directed thought, and that's not really that big a deal, but it's one thing to sit down ready to do a task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long you're supposed to be doing it. what i mean to say is that the time will seem to pass more slowly because i'll be watching the clock, so i'll probably be more bored, and i don't like to be bored. i'm not very far into this but my train of thought seems to have stopped. probably because my roommate(or actually suitemate; i have a room to myself but share a refrigerator, microwave and two bathrooms with two other guys)keeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly. it wouldn't be so bad if he'd just shut his door, but for some reason he hasn't thought of that. they've wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of my door now. now they seem to have left, so maybe i can concentrate. no, that didn't work. i've found it previously difficult to make my mind blank intentionally, but now it seems to come quite easily. i think probably i'm tired. the cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at my home, so when there's nothing else to do i usually watch something like comedy central late at night and shave a few hours off of a healthy amount of sleep. that's better; time's passing quickly now. which i normally wouldn't like, but this is something i wouldn't have done if it wasn't a grade(no offense to anyone involved in this research)and when you're forced to do something you want it to end quickly. i think the air conditioning in this dorm is screwed up. it's hot right now, and i had to buy a fan earlier to keep it semi-cool in my room. it doesn't work all the time. like right now. the fan's blowing on me, but i'm not cool. there he goes again. i think my roommate's playing 'sympathy for the devil' now. which isn't so bad, because that's a good song. i tried to learn the piano once, but i didn't stay on it for very long. i found that the teacher was really good for nothing, because i could learn everything she taught from the book itself. but when i stopped going to lessons i found too many other things to occupy my time, and stopped practicing. i would have liked to have been able to play the keyboard parts in several rolling stones songs. and several other of the 'older' bands' songs. most modern music is pretty much no good. and that brings an end to my twenty minutes.

"i didn't sleep at all last night and i'm barely making it through my day. i feel like a zombie, but hey what's new? i have an english paper due on monday. i think i completely bombed the thesis. i guess i can always go back and change it. i'm tired, i can't think. that's a lie, of course i can. it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble. and that counts too right? sure it does. i've been seeing this guy. he's about seven years older than i am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone i've dated before. i can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal. so why am i so doubtful? i suppose because i'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl. unfortunately i have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again. i'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person. anyway, my point is i'm scared to let him know i'm sincerely intersted because i think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction. i can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings. and i'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns. is he seeing anyone else? does he care? does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this. basically i'm so afraid of rejection that i'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance. i've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and i'm tired of not caring about anyone. anyone in that way i guess. yes i have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this. )but i miss that connection. i want to be in love again. but who doesn't? i suppose once i stop wanting it i'll find it. that's the way of the world sometimes. yeah but about him. it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it. plenty of fish in the sea and all that. but he does have some potential. enough of this. it's making my head hurt. i don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a ""dear diary"" than anything else. i'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment. i wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now. maybe none. everyone's in their own little worlds. deep inside their thoughts or their research. everyone seems so disconnectced, though i suppose that's the point of this place. a quiet area to get work done, not social hour. i'm about to go to ecology evolution and society. i've been reading the assigned chapters, but i fear that i'm not actually retaining any of the information. i guess it will become quite apparent when i get my first test scores back. all i want to do here is to do well. it's the only reason i'm living in austin again, to continue my education. so that's what i aim to do. make the most out of the billion things i have to accomplish today. cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new. life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects. so many people do that. drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless. just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well. that's what i think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest. the end. my time is up.

"my eyes are closed right now and i'm wondering if i'm doing things correctly. i just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. i wish i was there with her right now to talk everything out. its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. i am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. i want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. i'm just very exhausted. i've been going nonstop this entire weekend. just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as i type words on this keyboard. i feel it in my neck and the back. i just want to go to sleep. . but i must go on if i'm going to finish all my assignments. i'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. i think i'm going to do my psychology tonight. and here i am. i'm tired but i don't want to sleep. i don't want my weekend to end. it's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . if i don't sleep yet, maybe i could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. i've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. now i am wondering whether i'm doing this right. how can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. i'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think i'm insane after reading this. i rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. how can we truly define that word? i think everyone has a little insanity in them. just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term insane pretty difficult and complicated. it's not like there is a standard of being sane. everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? i think its amazing how i wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. i have another thought. my uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. are they insane? how could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them? i wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the ideal normal i don't think they do because schizophrenia is their normal. besides, who is to judge the ideal normal? i read a book by timothy findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own? i guess this question is a double edged sword. take from it what you will. i still have no idea. anyway, am i doing this correctly? oh here's another thought. . how do you know if i'm doing this correctly. it's my stream of consciousness. whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. for me i think it's normal. i write these kind of thoughts in a journal. i think the only reason why i'm sort of unsure is that i'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment. i am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. i'm actually kind of relaxed now. more sleepy. i think my 20 minutes is up.

"coming to ut has to be one of the best choices i have made. living in dobie has to be one of the worst. i wish i would have stayed at one of the honors dorms because the people seem so much more sociable. it seems that this place is extremely cliquish and such. my roommate is cool, although he seems to already have a group of friends here and isn't at all interested in making new ones. i'm a very social person. i have to be in contact with people all of the time or i get severely lonely. i don't like to feel cut off. i wouldn't even stay at my dorm the first night because i didn't have the internet or my cable connected. it is odd how we feel like television, internet, and phones make us feel so connected. i would die now without the internet. i love being able to chat with all of my friends about how they are doing in college. it is so odd being here at ut with so many students from big schools. i'm from such a small school i feel like i don't fit in or i don't know enough. it is odd how being from a small school can make you feel so inadequate at times. i feel like the others have some greater advantage than me. being at such a big university is such a big advantage. that is why i chose to come here. i really love how much a university this size has to offer. i mean look how awesome the stadium is and the the academic programs. the theater is wonderful and who can top gregory gym? it is so awesome to be surrounded by so much, but it is also so odd to feel so lonely sometimes. there is so much to do, but not always someone to do it with. i have one friend here with me from school. she is so much more than a friend. she means everything to me but she has hurt me so badly. i don't know if it is possible to overlook what she did to me last october. i can't tell if i could possible love her more than anyone else i'll even incounter, but it really seems possible. how else could you forgive someone so easily for hurting you so bad. she wants to be everything to me and all she wants is for me to say the same. but it is hard to base my life around someone that has thrown my life off balance once. she is such a good person and all she needs is someone to really love her and i really do love her a lot. i hope i can put the past behind us. we are so perfect ogether. we love similar things, yet we are really different. she loves art, i love art. she loves music, i love music. we are passionate about many of the same things. the sexual relationship is so nice too. i like feeling so hot and passionate. sex is kinda a thing in a relationship that is sybolic of acceptence to me. i mean when i bare myself to someone else it makes me feel good. i feel like we are really together. i've never even been with another girl. i feel like i am so unexperienced but it doesn't matter i guess. if you find someone you are willing to stay with why does it matter how many people you have sex with. i guess it is just society that tells us that we should have many sexual partners before marriage. that is so different from what the church teaches. i really don't agree with much of what the church say about sexual represion and not going with basic instincts or enjoying ones self. i kinda am a member of my own sect of religion. i think that there has to be some supreme authority but how am i supposed to believe that man can concieve this preterhuman figure. it doesn't seem like man should be able to explain the creator and so why try. i think that mans purpose it to better himself and the generation following him.

" i'm feeling that i miss my girlfriend in san antonio. as we do this i feel that she is my everthing i can't get her out of my head. what else i can't get out of my head is this music that the dorm next door to me is playing, it is making me really frustrated because i can't think quite as well. i hope that jess is okay, i worry about her a lot. she doesn't sleep too well, and that kind of worries me but she is extremely strong so i'm not too worried about it. i am kind of worried about what she just wrote to me in a letter i got. i know that she loves me but this college stuff, being apart and all is quite difficult. i don't like it and neither does she, and she wrote something that worries me, that she kind of wishes that we never met so that we never fell in love and therefore never have to endure the hardship of parting. i miss her a lot. my days primarily consist of me waiting around for her to get to her computer so i can instant message her, and communicate with her, truly the highlight of my day. the rest of my day is that of school, college that is, and i feel somewhat like a hermit but not too much, because i have her. she really is my everything, and i know that we will be together, forever. one thing that i do feel uneasy about is the fact that she is a christian and that i am an atheist. this hasn't played a part in our relationship, but i'm afraid that one day it will. i am a pacifist atheist and therefore will usually ignore most people's idea's, i know that that is wrong but oh well it's the way that i feel. i really don't want to destroy her sense of spirituality either, i've done it before to other people and it really makes them feel bad, and lost. i don't ever want to hurt jess, i love her, in fact i feel that i have to protect her from everything. i miss her, i don't like the fact that i have to be here in austin and she is nearly by herself in san antonio. but there is a glimer of hope, we might get an apartment together next year. i really hope that we do, that would be so great. i can think of nothing better than waking up to her smiling face everyday, and thinking to myself that i am the luckiest guy in the world. i hope that that happens, it really does help to have something that you can think about while you are away from someone that you love. all i can think about is how great it is when i make my bi-monthly trips during the weekends to see her. in fact i'm trying to plan something this weekend for her to make her feel as special as she really is. i think the world of jess. i don't know what i'm going to plan yet, i just can't think with this music, it really does irritate me quite a bit, i'm thinking that after the twenty minutes are up that i will go over there and tell them to turn it down. i love jess. i wish that i was with her right now, in fact sometimes i wish that i didn't have to go to college, just stay with her were we used to work forever. just being together with nothing to stop us, no one to get in the way, and no time constraints placed upon us. i love her very much. wow, i just looked at the clock and i have used 17 minutes already, only three to go. man, my fingers are getting tired from typing so much. i can usually get about 30 words a minute out, but i'm out thinking my typing, i want to write something down, and then bam another thought is in my head, my fingers can't keep up. i sure hope that i finish soon, because i see that my jess is online and that i want to talk to her real soon, this is the stuff that i wait hours for, just a chance to talk to her to be with her always. she is my everything, and i care for her deeply. i do get to see her on friday and i'm really happy. i hope that she will have as much fun as i will. i can't stop thinking about jess.

"i'm almost over being homesick and i'm starting to get into the groove of things. at first all i could think about was getting through the week and trying to come up with an excuse so that i would get a chance to come home and see all my friends. the first weekend i did just that and i did see some of my friends but then i realized they're going through the same thing that i am. most of my friends are spread out all over the place, from austin to college station to north carolina, my small hometown wasn't anything like it was when i left it. and that was just about two weeks ago. so by the time the weekend was over with i was actually ready to head back to austin. as of right now i really don't think about near as much. don't get me wrong i still wouldn't mind going home just to crawl into my good old bed back in palestine, but at least i can deal with it now. the only thing that is really on my mind is making sure that i'm prepared for every class. so when i go home at christmas my parents don't kill me for wasting all their money. they keep telling me that they expect me to bring home a's and b's. i don't know about all that but i'm going to try my hardest and hopefully that will be good enough.

"ok so right now i am thinking of the order that i plan to do things tonight and what exactly i want to do. my friend from back home is coming into town so i want to do something fun, so she will have a good time. i decided not to pledge this semester though so i don't have any fraternity hook ups any more like i did this summer so i don't know what i am going to do. i will probably call my friend matt who plays baseball for ut, he will most likely know of something that is going on. i think writing like this is really weird, i mean it is hard to believe that i am actually going to turn this in as a paper to be graded for school. it feels strange like i am doing the total wrong thing but you did say that it was a completion grade so i guess i am going to be ok. i keep looking at the time though to see how much is left, it is not that this is hard, it is just really strange, i mean i feel like i am writing a letter to one of my friends, and i'm just typing as fast as i can and saying whatever comes to mind, (to my knowledge that was the assignment) but i am not writing to my friend, instead i am writing to a professor and i excpect to get an a! oh well i just hope this is not too good to be true, these writing assignments i mean, it is like this isn't really work it is just a chance to tighten up my typing skills and kinda write a journal of sorts. ok so i just was thinking about how i need a 4. 0 this semester in order to make sure i get into the college of business at ut, and how that is the reason i am taking all fairly difficult classes to prove myself. well here is the thing, i had a 3. 7 as a transfer student and they still didn'tlet me in! it was because i didn't have economics, but still i had 42 hrs in just one yr of college, that is more than a great deal of people have after 2 years, at the least it is a semester ahead of schedule. so what i was thinking is how bad i want to get into business school but that i wasn't studying anything at the moment and how i really hadn't spent all my time studying but i feel that i am up to par with all of my classes but that maybe if i really want to get in i should be studying at all times and never really having fun. i mean the thing is i have decided that if i make a 4. 0 and am still not admitted i don't care, because it obviously wasn't meant to be, but i should be if i try my hardest i will not care, now i know that the only way i will be able to have peace with myself for not getting into business school is if i am condident that i gave 110% effort to get in, and i am afraid that if i am not studying and if i go out ever i will be unsatisfied and feel like a failure if i do not get in. plus i know that if i actually bust my ass and make a 4. 0 with my schedule, people will have to take notice. well i am having troube with the canturberry tales though, i mean i am good in english but i hate old english and trying to understand it, so when i read the canturberry tales it is like i am physically reading the pages but about 50% of the time i don't know what i am reading. so i tried to find a translation into modern english, and i found out that on the professor's test it is all basicaly quotes from characters and you have to identify, well if i don't read the original text i will not recognize the quote. then there is business calculus, basically i was a person who was always in the honors math classes because i was an honor student but i sucked in math, like i should have been in regular math, but know i wasn't so i basicaly glided through all of my highschool math classes with b's not learning anything, so now i have an espessially hard time doing complicated math because i don't know simple math, however i know i can do this because i took college algerbra last year and yes i did have to study and get tutoring help but i ended up with an a in the class. i suppose i will have to do the same in cal. well i am doing alright in my economics class at the moment although i am a little confused as to how to draw a supply and demand graph but i am not too worried about that. this class is something that i am really interested in and i enjoy it but the truth is i am a chapter behind in the reading, i have only read chapter 1. i guess when i get done typing this i could go read ch 2, but is the start of my 3 day weekend and man, i just want to hang out, i guess everybody does though and that is what seperates the people who just wish they had something and the people who go get what the want regardless of the sacrifice. ok so have now been over 20 mins but this was actually kind of fun. i hope this is what you were looking for. good bye byron ",1,"[1.668566, -0.825231, 0.926497, -1.127212, -0.950331, -0.963716, -0.799138, -0.373683, -0.256088, 1.227146, 0.174891, -0.590446, -1.53318, 0.287854, 0.171543, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.506369, 0.584582, -0.795527, 0.40255, -0.270677, -1.196852, 0.399305, 1.563325, 0.827902, -0.022301, 0.468065, -0.594994, -0.113137, -0.384846, -0.732187, -0.725825, -0.059763, -0.634377, -0.854562, 0.719041, 0.257383, 0.117138, 0.803975, -1.038726, -0.492327, -0.405157, -0.565789, 0.749841, -1.003169, -0.265203, -1.507088, -1.088618, -1.458933, -0.322595, -1.074563, -0.098221, 0.589063, 0.745535, -1.705758, -0.660895, -0.954251, 0.995954, 0.147693, -0.46334, 0.240862, -0.480161, -0.745201, 0.005374, -0.280398, -0.086094, -1.508173, 0.298924, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.607823, -0.117957, -0.337085, -0.422267, -0.708855, 0.166527, 0.139015, -1.225439, 5.023659, 4.074619, 4.346694, 4.977454, 4.465242]"
"as i sit here, i wonder what i got myself into. i came from a school of 300 people. i graduated with a senior class of 76. the university is such a huge place, i wonder if i'm going to fit in, or should i say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. it's not that i don't like my classes that i have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but i wonder what the future holds. my birthday is today, and i am finally 18. it seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. but now that i finally made it, it's no different. my mom called this morning to wish me a happy birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. her little baby girl is now 18. she asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. my grandparents also called this morning. they live across the street from my old house, and i was continuously over there visiting them. she told me that she still thinks that i'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. she says it's like i'm gone for the weekend, but i'll return soon. and my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. every time i look at him, i see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. raising 8 kids is no easy job. the day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. i was going to read for the mass. i went up to the podium and i looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. i was so proud to be a part of that. i was thankful that god allowed me to be there and have that feeling. and now when i talk to him on the phone, i get that feeling all over again. i miss him dearly. sometimes i think more than i miss my mom or my brother. now, my step dad, i don't miss him at all. sometimes i look back, and i don't know how i put up with him so long. he is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. he married my mom when i was 6 years old. i didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. he was just a total control freak. nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. from getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and i had gotten into a name calling fight. he's a dick, that's all there is to it. i never brought friends over to spend the night; i never wanted any guys to come over to see me. my escape place was at my grandparent's house. i would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. all he would tell me was that i could come up there and live with him any time i wanted to. on weekends i was hardly home, i was usually spending the night at holly's house, she is my best friend. now that i'm at college, i don't have to put up with him anymore. i don't plan on coming home anytime soon. my mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. talking about what comes to mind is difficult. i feel that i have burdened you with all of my family problems. don't feel sorry for me, i don't. life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes.

"my mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking of my roommate's mouse on her computer. it just keeps going and going and going. then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. i have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. i hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. he died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. now i'm thinking about lunch. which i was supposed to have an hour ago. yet, it is very upsetting because i have no food in the dorm in which i want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. i'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit austin from houston this friday. he'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. that will be quite exciting considering that i haven't had any great food in a long time. i'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where i moved from. this weekend i'll be going to see my parents. when i think of my parents, i get a guilty feeling because i know i haven't been very truthful to them. but, there are just things that i can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. it makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, i don't really miss them yet because i feel restricted in their presence. the sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. maybe because i just took a shower. my body feels warm and clean. i love that feeling. the sound of food is calling. but i need to type for another 15 minutes. for some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. the thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that i have an extreme hatred for insects. the thought of them makes me itch. now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. writing continuously makes me tired. speaking of sleepiness, i think of the experiment we did on monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. i was one of the control group people who just sat there. sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. i fell asleep soon after that. then i woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that i left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because i had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. it wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that i drooled all over myself. not a good image. speaking of image, i went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. it felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. usually i am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and ""mingle,"" but yesterday i needed to because it was a ""rush"" event. i am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something i really want to do because i'm not the extremely social type. however, as for now, i will keep on rushing to see how things go. it makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because i know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. it already makes him nervous enough to know that i'm up here at the populated university of austin, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. so, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. but like everyone's advice to me: don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. maybe this is why they gave me the advice. because every time i go to some party or meet new people, i feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. i suppose i get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. however, i am still determined to make this relationship work. now i am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. one more minute to go. i see einstein on my computer screen. he makes me want to do well in school. i hope i will do well this year. i feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but i suppose i'll learn to handle it.

"its really hard to write what i am thinking about because when i am asked to do that, i think about what to write. i then go and think of other things that are on my mind and really don't need to be shared with the general public. what i am physically feeling right now is heat. our house is hot although we have the a'c running non stop. mentally, i am confused. the thoughts that go through my head at times make me think that i am crazy and that i should seek help. i am not the only one who thinks that but my family members and my friends also think that i should get some help. but truthfully, there is no help. who controls the mind? ones self controls the mind. all i really have to do is concentrate and i can control myself. powerful things can be accomplished with mind control. its odd how sometimes i know what people are going to ask me before they ask me. it happens allot. then people look at me in an akward form. i don't know how that happens. it just does. i can also go through the thought process of other people. sometimes, when my friends perform certain actions, i can think the exact same thing they were thinking at the time they were doing that. the only time this thought process causes a problem is when i am reading the news and read about acts of violence against children. its not that great when you can place yourself in the shoes of the aggressor when you really don't want to. its all invouluntary. this would be allot easier if i was writing in pencil. i think faster when i am writing things down. it helps me organize my thoughts. when i speak to people, i like to confuse them. sometimes i confuse them so much, they believe that a conclusion was reached at the end of our conversation but when they think about it, they find out that i only caused them to think of more questions. i don't know why i enjoy that. when we think, what do we think about the most? what is easier or what needs a solution. writing about what i think is hard. i am not sure if i think of too many things at once or just don't think at all. i do just stop thinking and drift off into my own world and just stay there, thoughtless? feelings: mixed feelings. not sure what to do with my life. would prefer not to be in college but know that sucess comes with knowledge. psychology has interested me since i was a child. i like knowing what people are thinking about. that is what i do; i observe. but observation comes with a price. since i play the role of observer, it is hard for me to actually detail what is going on in my day and not others. people think that i really don't want to talk much about myself (which is true to some extent). what really happens is that i don't know how to organize my daily activities to be shared with others. silence is my audience when i am by myself. but when i need to concentrate and do my homework, i need noise. i can not concentrate where it is quiet. the silence distracts me. when i read, i listen to music. when i do other homework that does not involve reading, i listen to music, talk to others, and also do the homework of another class at the same time. i need distractions to concentrate. another physical pain came to my mind. i have back pain. most times, i take pain killers to ease the pain. the pain killers i use arent that effective and they are stong pain killers. i take hydrocodone and naproxen 500 mg each. i sometimes take two naproxen and one hydrocodone or vice versa. that does very little to ease the pain. since they are so effective, i just don't take them and deal with the pain. thanks to my servere back pain, i am now not affected by other types of pain. i need a new body. i also have knee pains. i have joint pain. i am overweight. i need to do something with my life. something new. i would like to skydive. life is not worht living if you don't take risks. i ran out of things to write about. i lost my stream of consciousness. i need the weekend to be here so that i can catch up on my homework. i procrastinate too much. i have talked to a psychiatrist before. it really didnt help. nothing helps. once must deal with their problems themself and keep them to themself. contorl them with ones mind and keep them undercontrol.

" my sandwich tastes really good! the pickle in it is a little too zesty, though. i don't think i'll buy those from heb anymore. i wish i had more time to watch tv. i really miss big brother 3, but i really can't find enough hours in the day. it makes me sad :( i have a latin quiz on friday, i don't know how well i'm going to do. i have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so i think i'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. that's the hard part! the paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. i get them confused sometimes. i'm upset that i went to college station this weekend and missed church. i really wanted to go this sunday, but instead i went to mass with my friend at college station. i had fun in cs, and i definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but i would have rather been back for the service. oh well, i can go on sunday. i start my job tomorrow!! i'm kind of nervous about that. i've never had a job before. what if i really screw up?? and what if i'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time? on tuesday and thursday, i'll have no problem, but what about friday? i work from 9-1, and i have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. i wish i would have just told her that i'd like to go into work an hour earlier on thursday and then i could get out of work an hour earlier on friday morning. that would have been perfect. but oh, well. what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . i took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!! i didn't think i'd ever finish it. i've only been typing for 6 minutes!! 14 more to go, lol. does anyone actually read these things? like, is it ok if i stop typing for a couple of seconds to take a bit of my sandwich? i think i'm going to, hold on. . yummy!! it's good, but those darn pickles. . oh well. what exactly are we supposed to talk about. what we see? or feel? or smell? or whatever. well, i'll tell you what i see. . wait! no, i'll describe my side of the room for you: on my closet door i have a movie poster of ben stiller's movie zoolander . it has a great big, lime green z on it and has zoolander written at tht bottom in purple letters. it also has ben stiller sitting kind of funny (i'm not sure how to explain it) in front of the z. at the top it says 3% body fat, 1% brain activity. i've never seen zoolander, have you? i just liked the poster because i thought it was funny. beside it, i have a movie poster of orange county. it has colin hanks on it with oranges for eyes, and jack black has an orange in his mouth. jack black is gross. . all he did the whole movie was run around in his underwear. 10 minutes up! halfway done. ok, back to my posters. the next poster i have is of audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany's, my favorite movie ever. she's wearing the black dress that she wears at the beginning when she's looking at tiffany's in the morning. remember that dress? she also has one of those looooong cigarette things, i'm not sure what it's called. *sigh* every girl should watch breakfast at tiffany's. it's the best. another poster i have is of rat race. everyone on the poster has big heads and little bodies. on the poster there's: i think his name is breckin meyer, he was on clueless, too. there's also amy smart, seth green, whoopie goldber, some guy who's name i don't know and can't relate another movie to him, cuba gooding, jr. , jon lovitz, and the guy who keeps falling asleep throughout the movie. he's my favorite. i'm win-ning! it's so funny! ok, i also have an ocean's eleven poster. it's read with white writing on it. in the front are the hotties george clooney, brad pitt, and matt damon, and in the back kind of faded out are the rest of their little helpers from the movie. beneath the title of the poster (ocean's eleven, hehe) it says they're having so much fun it's illegal. i think this is my favorite poster in my whole room. i also have a spy game poster on it. the only person on it is robert redford, and it says it's not how you play the game. it's how the game plays you. very cool. what else? oh! i also have a little picture, that is once again from breakfast at tiffany's. it has both audrey hepburn and george peppard looking in the window at tiffany's. she's wearing the same dress that she's wearing in my big poster and george is wearing a coat and pants, with a skinny tie. he has his hands in his pocket and is laughing abut something silly that holly golightly has said. at least, that is what i assume. i have been typing for 16 minutes and 50 seconds so that leaves me about 3 minutes left. hmmm. . what else can be said. i have to save some describing for later, i don't want to give it all away in this first time. what will i talk about next time? are there ever going to be subjects for you to talk about, or will it always be like a mad journal thing? i understand this mad journal thing, though, because what if you gave me a subject that i didn't really have much to say about. what would i say then?? so, i guess this is good, just mad journaling. . i'll think about what to say more next time, so i'll be a little more prepared and won't bore you out of your mind. 18 min. 48 seconds. . 1minute and some odd seconds left. 19 min!! woo-hoo. ok one more minute. what about this war gwb wants to have with iraq?? is he nuts! that'll be 2 wars (or at least fights) that we've had while he was president. how sad. 20 seconds left. what to say, what to say. . 10 seconds. well, i'll start my good=byes now. goodbye!!

" usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""how am i going to do it? where do i start? where do i finish? how do i know that i am doing it right?"" this is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. i can't wait till saturday because i will attend the first ut football game this season, which i might add, will be my first time to attend one. the weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when i was up here for summer school. its a real drag. i'm always so tired i hate it. labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. maybe i'll go visit brett (an el paso friend) at the hidious a & m, college station, the drive is a drag though. the road trip that me and lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. all they're concerned about is putting ut down or ""tu"" as they call us since we're not ""the"" university of texas but ""a"" texas university! isn't it stupid. still admit i'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. they do have a lot of school spirit. makes me wish that i was into that stuff. who knows, maybe when all the football games start. i want to see how crazy us longhorns really get. i can't wait till softball games start, i want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!! hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, i will be ready to try out. i'm really discouraged about trying out this year, i know i'm not ready. my family's encouragement helps but i don't want to make a fool out of myself. i can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a ut uniform. how amazing. that is my goal!! if i can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't i have a shot on the team. i just think that i lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. it may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. i love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. i love it. there are a lot more responsibilities though, but i'm picking up on the time management. the incubus concert is coming up and i'm (since yesterday) going. i've only heard a few songs by them so i can't say that i'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. but hey i'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. i should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. its worth the experience.

"september 4, 1997 i am not too sure what to write about. i am hungry right now. i have anorexia nervosa, so i not only am constantly thinking about food, i also won't allow myself to eat it when i want it. i am actually in the recovery stages right now. i have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. the only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. that treatment would be out of state (in arizona) and would last at least 60 days. it doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. the battle is all in my head. it is my mind that will not ""allow"" me to eat when i am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me i don't need to gain weight, that i am not critically underweight, and that i am physically in good shape. the whole thing is very confusing to me. my psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. i think this class is interesting so far. i have enjoyed reading in the book already because i deal with this stuff on a daily basis. i am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. my psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones i am taking this semester. (i think she's a little partial to the subject myself. ) i have to go see her on tuesday, which is only 5 days away and i am scared half to death. she scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like i said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat. right now, she has threatened me by saying i will have to go to the treatment center if i haven't gained 15 pounds by a certain date. that date is coming up in two weeks. i have had this agreement with her since the end of june. i am really very scared because i really do not think i have gained near that much. it's strange how i can think about it realistically and know that i am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me i am fine and don't need to gain. but, as the date comes closer to my appointment, i will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. and still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing. you have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder. you won't want to do it, you'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go. i have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital), but i haven't been able to do much of this by myself. it seems like it isn't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety. instead, by ignoring it, you get to feel hungry, tired, irritable, you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight, you make your family freak out, you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to college. it seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten, and i can logically see that. my mind is just totally screwed up, which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase. i hope i will make it to the point soon. it's just all too confusing to explain. i am sure everyone thinks i am crazy, but you just can't explain to someone how you feel. i wish there was a cure or some more insight to it. i am interested in what this class has to say about things like this. maybe i'll get some more insight into it (if that is possible since i live it!)

"i feel so blessed to be here right now. the game tonight was so fun. i can't believe that we won 65-0. that's such an incredible win. poor north texas guys. they must feel pretty embarrassed. i feel so content here and settled even though i've only been here a couple of weeks. i think that i am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home. i miss judd so much. the time we get to spend together is never enough. its funny to me how i haven't missed my parents at all but i think about and miss judd all the time. i just love the way he makes me feel, so warm and so complete. i'm so glad that i have friends here like oshley and that i totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate. i'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we're still good friends. i was so surprised when i saw him on the jumbotron tonight. i feel so proud of him. i can't stop thinking about how lucky i feel to be here. i just love it here and can't wait till judd gets here. i think i want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here. its just so amazing. the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing. living in new braunfels was such a bubble. this feels more like the real world. i know that people say college is still a bubble and i think they're right, but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels. i miss high school, but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown. at the game last night, i felt a little sad that i wasn't down there on the track cheering. now that judd and i were together, part of me wishes i could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship - the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader. it would've been so much fun to have that sort of experience! i'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because i feel like they aren't taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they've got down there. those were the best times of my life thus far. i know that better are sure to come in my years here at texas, but i just wish that i could go back, just for one friday night, and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd. it makes me so sad that i probably won't ever get to perform like that again. my dancing and cheering days are over and i just want them back. its not that i miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program, i just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans. i thrive off of that and now i feel a little empty since i don't get to do it anymore, and i especially feel it when i see the new girls down there on the track. i feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that i'm in college because all i ever talked about in high school was how i couldn't wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student. granted i definitely don't miss the drama of high school, i do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading. the more i keep thinking about this the more sad i feel. i think the biggest problem is how much i miss judd. we spent so much time together this summer and i just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever i needed him. i can't believe i fell in love with him. he's just an amazing guy. the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his christianity. its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and i was too young to question it and now its just a part of who i am and i'm so thankful for that. but judd didn't grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he can't prove really is there. i think its a matter of pride. the idea of giving himself to someone else that he doesn't really know is there doesn't settle well with him. or maybe its a trust issue. or maybe both. its just hard because i can't really understand how he can not have belief, and he doesn't understand how i can. oh man i have a lot of homework this weekend. i really have to finish it all tomorrow so i can go home and see judd. i can't wait to see him tomorrow. i wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me. i can't wait for him to come to school up here and be with me! that will totally complete me here. i don't know if i'm complete without him. i've never felt dependent on someone like that before. well i think my time is almost up. in conclusion, i feel so amazed that i'm actually here. i miss my friends who aren't here, and i especially miss judd. i want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer.

"my thoughts and feelings at the moment reflect several important aspects of my life. perhaps, one of the most recurring thoughts has been my progress with my academic success. i am worried and concerned with maintaining an above average status as a student. one other concern of mine relates to my commitment toward studying and learning. i fear that i will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home. thus, most of the time i reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried. i feel in great anguish and perhaps, turmoil. i am also very concerned about the financial needs and requirements of college. often, i feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents. this, in turn, causes much sadness for me. although the social aspect of my life, at the moment, is not a significant matter, i still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that i left behind. i comprehend the fact that any transition in life accompanies great distress and agitation. however, i find myself more weary and temperamental than distressed or melancholy. at times, i feel as though i have not slept for days. i feel constantly fatigued. i have always realized that i worry to a great degree; and at times that my lifestyle has dramatically changed, this aspect of my personality has in turn worsened. i see myself literally concerned about every trivial matter in life. i worry a lot about my weight issues. lately, i have noticed a dramatic change in my eating habits. through the past year, i was able to lose a great amount of weight and maintain it. i was also able to control what i ate in addition to exercising a great deal. however, lately i have deviated from this habitual behavior. i have gained about 10 pounds. i feel greatly out of control. i do not even have the motivation to exercise. often, i wake up in the morning and find myself critically loathing every aspect of my appearance. at school, i often compare myself with other females and feel greatly embarrassed. my parents and my acquaintances have at times mentioned that i look better now that i am not so underweight. however, i do not perceive or comprehend their point of view. as a result, i promise myself almost every day to lose all the unnecessary weight that i have gained. i even plan a strict diet for the next weeks. however, i never follow through the plan. although this recurring thought is truly trivial in comparison with matters concerning my education, i still cannot rid myself of the compulsive need to restrict my diet and control my eating habit. i believe that there is great tension in my life at the moment. perhaps, this is true for a lot of students that have began their first year of college experience. regardless of my emotional well being at the time, i still seek hope and remedy in studying and experiencing all the knowledge that college has to offer. i am sure that if i put enough effort into my academic advancement i will easily succeed in future. nevertheless, i truly wish that i could annihilate the worries that accompany me day and night.

"sometimes i wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, i guess living in general. what is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. i wonder if that was his plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. in a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. as a follower of the times, my faith in him has also declined as the years have gone on. well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. as i entered high school, i was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. but i realized that life is only as big as you make it. if you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. but back to my point. i made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as i've moved to the next step in my life. my five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that i knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. don't get me wrong, i am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but i don't think that i realized what i was losing. my best friend with whom i spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. i didn't realize how much i would miss him until he left. when i see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. my girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. i knew leaving her would be most difficult, but i underestimated the pain. i miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. i feel like i don't know her as well as i used to and i wonder if i ever will. the leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. i guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, i don't know. anyhow, i wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. but for now, i guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive!

"well, topday when i was sitting in the cafeteria, i was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, ""congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. "" that was kinda strange because i don't usually curse until i came onto this campus. i have no idea why. he asked me if i did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no i don't. i don't usually curse. the only time i ever did that was if i felt pain or something. i never felt the need to curse and i know that it's a filthy habit. i also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. i can't figure it out. i have noticed that i curse a lot and i've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, i don't really want to because it's fun. i don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion i came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because i know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but i don't care. i have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. i know that it's not but i can't stop sometimes. well, i can but i choose not too. . fire drilll!!! oh well. last i left off was awhile ago. i kinda lost train of thought. i don't remember what i wrote and i don't feel like reading what i wrote. now i feel kinda tired because i walked up the 13 flights of stairs. i wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. i'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. i'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, i'll be in big trouble. a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. i hate to pass judgements and crap like that so i pretend that it's all good. i don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but i did meet them here. i don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so i don't want to say too much. lets just say that i see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. i'm not sure what i'm suppose to write about. i know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am i suppose to write about. the first time i heard about this, i thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and i at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness. i wonder if i'm out of breath. would that effect how well i think. cause i'm writing this stupid assignment, and i seem to have trouble because i'm thinking too much about breathing. i always have this huge headache. i think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. i don't know. i don't care. actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because i can just write whatever i want and know that as long as i turn it in, i'm ok. no matter what i say or how i say it, it's all good. but, when i came in the room after that firedrill, i didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. i'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. i know i have to write for 20 min. and i have another 3-4 min. to go. i don't want to do this anymore. i'm tired. i'm not even thinking anymore. i got to pee, but i don't want to unless i'm finished with this assignment. man i got to pee. ok, i'm going to end this assignment now that i think i'm done.

""black magic woman"" is playing on the radio. i like this song. it reminds me of my mom because she has the record from when she was a santana fan. the artwork on the cover of the album is really beautiful. there is a red winged creature on the cover and a lot of complex looking designs and a million different colors and stars and growing things. it looks like the night. today in class i was about to fall asleep. i looked over at aisha and she was practically dead. i don't think it was because the class wasn't interesting but because it was just the time of day when i feel really tired and i can't really think of anything. when i walk around i feel really relaxed, not at all anxious, and it's kind of pleasant. it reminds me of this boy that works nights, and he would hardly ever sleep and it was kind of nice to be around him because there wasn't a whole lot going on. we would just sit around listening to music or watching things. when he's not tired he talks a lot, and it kind of drives me crazy sometimes. he just talks about cars a lot and how things work and scientific stuff, and he's very passionate about those kind of things. i saw him on monday and he told me he loved me, and it was so weird. i don't know where that is going. i've known him forever, and i think of him as a person that i can really trust and talk to things about. he reminds me of my father in some ways because my dad always talked a lot sometimes about things that didn't interest me very much but i liked him anyway. i liked how fat he was. it makes me laugh. he was a rather large man and he had really hairy arms like a bear. for some reason i think it's kind of funny to look back on this but maybe it's because i'm kind of tired although i shouldn't be because i've been getting plenty of sleep lately. i wake up in the mornings, and i have this feeling like i just can't wait to get out of the room and walk around, get some fresh air and get out of this little room which i have to share with another person and deal with all her stuff and everything. she's really nice though. i think i might have offended her yesterday because we were talking about genesis, which we both have to read for our literature class, and i have a lot of questions about what it means and why it's so sacred and important and why god does all the weird stuff that he does in the book. i can't understand why he forbids people to eat the fruit or why he tells people to name their children certain things or why he appears and fights with jacob. it's pretty messed up if you ask me. how am i supposed to believe in that stuff? it's nuts. i just want to be a good person like my mom. she always helps other people and thinks about others. when my dad was dying, she held everyone together and probably saved me along with everyone else. i don't think i would still be alive without my mom. she's really religious and perfect in most ways. i wish nathanael were here. he makes me feel better about things most of the time even though he weird me out at times. i wish i could go driving out in the country or even for a walk. i grew up on a farm, and i love open fields and fish and cows and crap like that. it's unfortunate because i can't imagine living anywhere else but in the country even though it is lonely at times. it is so peaceful and beautiful at night. one night nathanael and i stayed up all night and watched the sun rise. we were sitting on his truck. that was the night before i went to germany for 3 weeks to visit my best friend who lives there now. i love her so much. she was one of the few people that i ever thought was really like me. she was an incredible artist, and she inspired me to take up drawing and painting. my dad was an artist too. i have one drawing of his on my room at home. he liked to do cartoons and make corny jokes. he was so wonderful with people, and everyone loved him. sometimes i imagine what it would be like if he just walked into the room right now and how i would feel about seeing him after all this time. for i second i feel so excited, but then i realize that it could never happen. it is the most horrible feeling to know that you will never again see someone that you love so much, especially someone that you admired and tried to make yourself like them.

"it's crazy to think here i am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. i am now a college student. during high school i couldn't wait for it and now that i'm here i feel out of place. sure, i know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names i no longer remember, and i stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what i expected. the classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially ut. i have not had the success i had i hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that i am, i expected it to come easier. i tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. it makes me wonder if i should have rushed, though i do not see myself as a sorority girl. it seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. are they really paying for friendships? i do not think i would have fit in to such a place. i just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that i will meet some people with whom i really enjoy hanging with. i am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next monday. with 30 people in the class, i know i will get to know some of the other students. i never thought i would admit to being homesick, but it is true. though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. however, when we are there we tend to hate it. isn't it funny how that works? i have also decided that austin is a city full of beautiful people. everywhere i look, goodlooking boys and girls. it definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. i enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. should i really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? well, i do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. i believe i am finding competition in everything. whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people i know. the people i went to high school with. the people whom i now want to separate myself from. another thing i have noticed is how sleepy i always am. here i am at 12:22 writing this when i am insanely tired. but why go to sleep, when i do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. there are also a lot of sick people around. the allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere i have been. i have had a cough and a cold since i've been here. it seems like i have so many problems, but i know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. that is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. i know i need to give things time and make the best of what i have.

"ok well i'm thinking about how long of a day it was, i got to school kind of late and i was almost late to my first class. i'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny i think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 35. i just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and i told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it. well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 7:15 if she hasnt called me. she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester. she was very moved by the way the professor was. i think she said i wish i had him for my psy class. i told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr. daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and i have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm. class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends. by the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and i love her a lot, i don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, i think we are different than most couples, i know that everybody probably says that but i really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and i hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve god in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples i think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks. but since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, i think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night. now back to her other friend named nancy. well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what i hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt. without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad. me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be. like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here. well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share. hmm. what a coincidence, i mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and i think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, i mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot. my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and i told him that i don't know because i running tight on money and i kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because i went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel. the part that she got mad at was the jeans that i bought for 100 dollars and that's because they were on sale. she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that. so i don't know if ill go but i do want to play him in ncaa 2005 college football that's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that i haven't even tried it i think i'm going right now to go play laterz!

"i am really quite flustered right now, because i already wrote this assignment earlier, and the philosophy systems were probably down, and now i cannot retrieve the file from where i saved it. anyways, hardly makes a difference though. i can't help wondering about the purpose of this assignment. i mean, the teacher hardly even knows me, and probably cannot even relate to what i am thinking about. i guess this must be a way of doing research, and we'll eventually learn about it. i wish all assignments were just as simple. but its difficult to suddenly get used to this american system of education. this does get strange and intimidating sometimes, with large classrooms and lack of onetoone interaction. but it is nice, and i will definitely get used to it. today is monday, and a whole new week lies ahead. i quite dread monday mornings. not because i have to go to class, but because i have a slight fear of the unknown. what if i have forgotten to do an assignment, what if i annoy a teacher! i am really hungry. i had a small lunch last night. cafeterias were closed so i made some sandwiches at home. i wish i had a car. then i could go out anywhere and eat at anytime. i could even go to sixth street. i want to buy a sports car. i will buy an italian sports car once i earn my own million dollars! but that's a long way to go. i want to eat at kinsolving dining hall today. i am quite tired with the food at jester. but its pretty far from jester, and i hate to walk. i guess i'll eat in jester itself. i wonder what my friends back home must be doing, especially tanaya. i hope they miss me as much as i miss them. i can't wait to go back to india, but i don't think i'll get to go before summer. i bump into them online almost everyday, so i do feel quite close. but personal meetings are totally different things. my room is such a mess. i will have to clean it up. will do it on thursday. thursdays are wonderful. i have only one class, so i do all other work on thursdays. but this is not a good habit. i eventually end up putting off all my important work to thursdays, and then run out of time on thursdays even! i wish the weekend were longer. i need my own computer. i'll get one soon. i hope i get a good deal though. then i wont have to go to the lab each time i have to do an assignment. my uncle is dallas said he could get me one for a decent price. i will probably go meet him next week if it fits in my schedule. great, my 20 minutes are almost up. this assignment was fun. i hope that all the others are as much fun to do.

"in the eighteen years of my life i've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. i was born with one. in my heart i bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. what is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. i believe that education can free a man. an educated society becomes more aware. it can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. it has become my belief that i or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. the conscience in me longs to make a difference. to scream at the top of my lungs, ""this is wrong! you are wrong! give back his rights! give back what does not belong to you!"" but i know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. this gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, i am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. my first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. more likely i am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. within me i feel no intimidation toward others strengths and i take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. determination is the driving force of my soul. being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. i know only if i want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. it seems forever that i have expected highly of myself. with every aspect of my life i feel a certain pull to be the best i can be. rarely do i accept being less. my love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. i cannot accept just reading new knowledge. it is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. this allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for i do not like being put in the dark. i must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. this gives me confidence and strength. hopefully, i will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world.

"today i had a fairly busy day i believe as i am feeling a bit tired right now. i wonder what time it is. oh it's 9:14 p. m. right now so i guess i can continue writing this assignment. haha i'm just kidding. i feel good about myself right now because earlier today i helped somebody out who needed it. she is my sister's friend, i guess an acquaintance for me, and one of the tires on her car got a flat. she and my sister both didn't know what to do, so my sister called me and i came and fixed her tire for her. after that she bought my sister and me dinner as a way to say thanks. i feel better now than i used to about a week and a half ago because i tried out for the marching band here but i didn't make it. i was really depressed for a day or two because i've been involved with band for the past seven years of my life in high school and middle school. but after awhile i began to realize a few of the benefits of not being in band. for example, i don't have to buy those stupid white plastic shoes all the members are required to wear so i can save some money. also i have a lot more free time than i've had in a long time. it feels really good to be able to take long naps in the middle of the day without having to worry about practice"" at 6 p. m. in the evening and interrupting my sleep. man, that timer on the top of the screen is going really slow. it says it has only been eight minutes but it feels like twenty already. my wrists are beginning to hurt. i want to listen to music on my computer right now but i can't because my roommate is on his cell phone talking to his friend and i know my music will only bother him. we don't share the same taste in music. in fact, i think we are as far as possible in our tastes in that category. i think these chairs they give us for our dorms are very uncomfortable. i mean, they're completely wooden with no cushioning at all. you would think that in the honors dorm we would get special treatment of some kind, but so far i think we are being treated the exact same way as the freshmen who are going to drop out at the end of the semester. it's hard to concentrate right now because i usually need music to help me concentrate. i like the upbeat kind of music that has a constant bass drum playing really loudly on all of the down beats. i also like classical music and music that has drums and stringed instruments at the same time. i'm not sure what the kind of music is called, though. however, i don't like oldies or country music at all. in fact, i hate that kind of music. that's why my roommate and i don't share the same tastes. he likes that kind of music. i just heard somebody running down the hall of my floor at a really high rate. i wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 9:30p. m. maybe he was running to get more beer for the party. just kidding again. no need to get investigators up here or anything. but earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people, so something was definitely going on. i was thinking about emailing that dj guy for our class. i don't remember his name, though. i have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class, and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and doesn't think he is. he thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him. ok! i only have one minute left. after this, i think i'm going to get ready for bed because all this sigmund freud type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy. i think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than i thought i was when i first started typing this.

"what an evening! i have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now i am in the worst mood. i went with my suitemate to pick up food from taco cabana. everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food. then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size. finally, we got our food, and it was right. we drove back to our dorm. the castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage. i park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to. after ten minutes, i finally got my car in my assigned spot. when we were getting out, she grabbed the food and i grabbed the two drinks. we had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator. finally, it came and we headed up to our room. i stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as i attempted to unlock my door. as i was doing this, i even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while i opened the door, but i just ignored because i thought i had them. i made it in the door successfully, but as i was going to set them down, i dropped both of them all over my area rug. irate, i bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and i screamed how much i really wanted a soda since i haven't had one all week! i knew i had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained. i proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized i had forgotten the detergent. all the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold. when i walked in to the laundry room, i whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as i type this, i can feel the bruise forming. i kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor. i slipped 3 times before making it to the machine. i was so mad by this time that i just decided to wash my rug without any detergent. now, here i am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events. i get back in my room and the internet is not working!! i realize that i am so sick of fighting with the apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm. so now, here i am eating the soggy nachos that i paid 6 bucks for. all i can smell is the food, but now i'm really not hungry. you should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse. their tv or radio is really loud and i can hear it from here. oh geez, now they're knocking on my door. ""is your internet working?"" it just came back up a few minutes ago is what i told them. for a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst. now i am thinking about the phone call i just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement. she did not offer me any words of advice! ""things happen!"" she said. wow! no kidding!! i don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while i am writing this. i look around my room and all i can see is a big mess! as of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question! i'm seeing my wet school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks. wow!! i think this is the worst mood i've ever been in! my room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which i have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear. my suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room. it is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that i have back home! he acts so funny sometimes. he thinks he is so hard to get when i know that when i go down there, he will come right back to me. he's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home. i was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now i am completely set back. nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that i was supposed to do. my stomach is growling because i am so mad. it gets like this when things go wrong. i hate when things go wrong!! my mom's words are ringing in my ears. ""things happen!"" ""i just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when i talked to you earlier!"" then come my suitemate's words.

"my goodness, i have so much stuff to do. where should i start? i have to call about volunteering and for sure email anne to see if they have a physical therapy program at her hospital. how will i get this stuff done. i am torn as to whether or not to join a fraternity. i think i will, i just hope i have time to get my studies done. as well as time to myself. i really need to get my bike back from maggie's apartment. i'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. sometime tomorrow i have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. i need 2 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. i am so glad i changed my class schedule. it will be so much better this way. i am so stressed out about physics. i so hope i at least make a ""b"" in there. pray, oh pray. i should make it to the bsm thursday evening and check that out. i am sure there are some good looking ladies there. i can't believe the horns lost. what the heck? to n. c. state. they better come back and win this week against stanford. actually we need ricky back. another thing is i need to wash my car. it's pitiful! definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. i seriously hope things go well with the fraternity. i mean that is a lot of $$$. campus looks nice tonite. i love the tower. i think i like college football way better than pro. it has so much more of an aura to it. the pros don't have any spirit. the college game is where it's at. i wonder where my roomate is. that punk never tells me when he's leaving. i still have to do the pretest. i tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. i need to make sure and read for history and government. i hope this thursday schedule is going to work. i am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like i thought it was going to be. actually pretty good. oh man, i just got an instant message. oh well, i really need to finish this assignment. i kind of like this. let's me get my feelings out. i need to find a church for sure. i haven't been reading my bible like i should since i got to austin. i really need to work on that. i wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. this move from a juco college is a bit extreme. nothing like high school to college, but i went from a college with 5,000, to a college of 50,000. i probably have met 200 people so far. i am so terrible with names. i really need to work on that. my suite mates are being loud. makes me not want to study. or at least go elsewhere. i should probably check out the ugl or pcl anyway. i bet i could do a better job there in the first place. so what am i going to do this weekend? it being labor day, i kind of have a choice. i might go to houston to visit my sister or might stay and go to the lake with richie and jason. i really miss my folks. way more than i expected. i hope i get over it soon. i need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. i wonder what my new physics prof is going to be like? good or bad? nice or unpleasant? what? i need to start praying more. maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. whatever happens, i need to call gina tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. this class schedule is going to be so much easier! i love it! no friday school! three day weekends for a whole semester. i hope my tth classes aren't too strenuous all together. this is my first time to really balance 3 classes like that.

"now the computer is making noise. i wonder why it does that. i have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. i guess that is what it is doing but i am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is quentin and i am in psychology 301 with pennebaker. so far i have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. i am not for sure if it is because i find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and ' or interesting in his way of presenting the material. either way i enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. i am starving too. i wonder what we are having at the phi gam house for lunch today. it better be good. i am starving. i have had a bad headache all day too. i hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because i haven't eaten lunch yet. i t will probably go away when i8 eat. it usually does. tonight i have a lot of homework to do. chemistry is keeping me very busy. i had no idea that chem204 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. i wonder if i will play catch with scott again today. it will probably be good for me if i do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. i wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. i wonder of pres. clinton is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with monica lewinsky like he did. that was really stupid of him. i can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. i bet hillary is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what i saw. that sucked that i had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. i wonder how long aikman will be at he is supposed to be out for 4 to 8 weeks. i think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. i never knew he went to ucla until this weekend when they said it during the horns v. ucla game. i wish we would have won that game, but i really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. i hope that is caries over to the kansas st. game. if we would win that game it would be so large. i wonder if we are still going to be in the top 25 pole after this weekend. i hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. ricky did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. i wonder if all of my friends had fun in cali. while they were there for the game. i hope i get to go to cali. for some reason in the near future. i have never gotten to go there before. i think i get to go this summer with jenny and her family if they still go. that would be fun. mom and dad head for england in about 2 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. i wish i could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, i want to go on a cruise sometime too. i think that would be the most fun. i can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. i have seen pictures but that is all. i hope i can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows.

"well, i'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that i know i have to do this. just got back from school and had lunch. my whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. i cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. i've left the tv on. i always like to watch something as i eat. something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. it's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. i've always wondered about the concept of time. how it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. i have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. i'm not getting old so much as i had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. i was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to san marcos to do some shopping. my boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. what a nasty shock!. at least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. i left the tv on way too loud. funny how i sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others i love background noises. leave the tv on just for ""company"". talk about true desperation. csi is on. love the show. absolutely fascinating. i am such a tv addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. got an exam coming up on monday, got to start studying for that. hope it's not too tough. gosh, i really miss home and family. it's tough being away in a foreign land. i can't wait to get back to sydney and singapore. i am so looking forward to my trip in europe at the end of the year. i am so excited about vienna and italy. i love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. it was hot out today. i'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. the ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. i'm glad i missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. like winter so much better. i'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in europe. have to admit that i don't really know what else to talk about. i just know that i want to shower after this but knowing me, i'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the csi marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so i can continue the moving process. my new apartment needs a lot of tlc before it will be in tip top shape. then again, only about three more months till i leave the states and am back on the road to canada, europe, asia then australia. this year has been a most trying one. but i know that i am a stronger and wiser person for it. i've been through so much in life, but i know there's so much more. i'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in harvard before i leave and a family friend in new york. my body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. maybe i won't need'want that fan after all. there's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. i am almost there, just 2 more minutes left. i really need to focus my time and attention on what i'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. i'm actually speaking as i type. is that normal? or more precisely, that's normal for me. i wonder what professor pennebaker would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. ok. back to csi.

"you know i always wonder if i'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. i had opportunities to go to other universities but i chose to stay close to home. my parents always want it there way! they basically chose my major for me and when i wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. i want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and i know i'm going to stress over it, why should i bother to listen and i went with what i felt was best for me and i made the change. i always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. i see people trying so hard to make that a in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. one thing which confuses me is how girls think. they're like in their own world sometimes. you try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest idiot! i wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. they should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. why do the astros suck so bad this year? they had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. they were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. they're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the astros. i mean if you had bagwell, biggio, alou, caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? the rockets need to do better next year also. i can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. they could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. if they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. i don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. it would be so much easier to study the material but no, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. one thing i really love in the university are the girls. they are so damn hot! only if i could have one of them would i show them what kind of man i really am! its ok, one day, i will find the right one.

"it is weird to be here because usually people are here and i could visit them but no one is at home. my brother is now doing all the stuff i did last year and it's kind of a weird role reversal. i am also frustrated because i am here and if it was normal circumstances jared would be here but of course his family decided to take a vacation and they are out of town. and it's so weird and frustrating to be here and not be able to just call him and see him, i guess it is part of the annoying ""sensitivity"" that girls seem to employ. i need to get out of that habit. but, in an hour and a half or so, i will be driving back to ut and bringing my roommate's and also my friends from here. the whole situation did not work out exactly how we planned because i was going to stay here this whole weekend but then jill's ride got all messed up so if i don't bring her up today i have chris and emily who will be very disappointed and i would feel guilty if i just stayed here instead. but actually i kind of just do want to stay here at home for awhile and actually get some stuff done and just relax but i also am torn the other way too. whatever, my mind is so strange sometimes. and also i am feeling stupid writing all these thoughts down. am i going to be diagnosed with some kind of disorder by what i've written? rhetorical question. computers can be very frustrating. it is really getting on my nerves that i am not allowed to complete my pretesting requirement on here. at first i couldn't even access the screen to type in my social security number and then when i could do that it won't accept my password or user name. that is all very frustrating and i've tried all these different computers trying to access it. oh well. hopefully, i will finally figure it out. as i just skimmed over what i've written thus far, i am worried. the blurb above says there is no right or wrong thing to say but i have before, just done completely the opposite of what was intended on an assignment and i had to redo it so this makes me slightly nervous as to if the content of this is adequate or not. it is very quiet in this area right now and my thoughts seem so loud in comparison since they are all that i can ""hear"" and it all the activity that is going on. this assignment is actually kind of ironic because usually, i do write down everything that is in my head, like my thoughts and my feelings, and it helps me sort things out. it usually angers my friends because then they never know what upset me before because i wouldn't say anything because i'd have to go write it down to figure it out. yet, while i'm typing this, it seems so forced to have to write down my thoughts. i guess because the ""audience"" i am typing for is so unknown and i feel self conscious of what i write. i just thought about this calculus homework i've been trying to work on for the past hour or so. it is so aggravating to try and understand something and completely fail or only understand a little bit which does nothing for progress toward solving the problem. i guess that is something i miss. i miss my smaller classes where there was always a lot of discussion and interaction. i guess in a way i'm being selfish but i can't help feeling that way. oh well, i guess i am still in transition but i'm used to everything i just am not sure how much i like everything. well, i guess that is all my thoughts for now. i am so random sometimes. my train of thought that leads me to some comment or question is sometimes so mixed up and completely out of nowhere that i can't even believe how i think of some things. i'm not sure. but i bet a psychologist somewhere could figure that dilemma out. : ) ",1,"[1.220493, -2.105558, -0.969212, -1.999243, -1.705572, -2.448813, 0.836553, 0.657746, 1.088803, 0.242617, -0.070351, -0.202711, -0.469586, 0.603079, 1.568623, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.357321, -5e-06, -0.576514, -0.155256, -0.742368, -0.737367, 0.724204, -0.130704, -1.143091, 0.214043, -0.668493, -0.003001, -1.077005, -1.100231, -0.170186, 1.188545, 0.239189, 1.058388, 0.269725, 0.959641, 1.050677, 0.635813, 0.012144, -0.516832, 1.948189, 2.42722, -0.653842, -1.134609, -0.08253, 0.307618, -0.972486, 0.155289, -1.005635, -0.884899, -1.090838, -0.233132, 0.012611, 0.441348, 2.537811, 0.350841, 1.379344, 1.772598, 1.164834, -0.141538, 0.614397, -0.480161, -0.745201, -0.546834, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.721501, -0.437633, 0.060132, -0.23436, -0.354574, -0.37208, -0.337085, 1.497877, -0.12248, -0.451544, -0.161673, -0.725899, 4.565029, 4.484537, 4.246289, 4.518638, 4.44304]"
"it was the second one for this job at the astronomy lab. i would be really excited if i got this job. mostly because the people seem really laid back and fun. also because i want to know about the stars. that would be neat to be able to impress people with my boundless knowledge about the boundless sky. i think i have a pretty good chance at getting the job. i was the very first person to call after she put the advertisement in. she told me to come in for an informal interview, mostly to show me around the place and introduce me to people. by the time i got there, 5 other people had called. today she said she had spoke to about 30 people and narrowed it down among me and two other people. i think the interview went pretty well. i concentrated on sending out a hire me vibe. i wonder if being the first caller will increase my chances. what a cool job. so john has asked me to go see giant with him tonight. i think i'll go. i hope he doesn't fall for me. that sounds conceited, but almost all of the guys that i want to be just friends with have a nasty habit of falling madly in love with me. it's really annoying. maybe i should concentrate on being just friends with all the boys and that way the ones that i want to fall madly in love with me will. this sounds like the null hypothesis that we learned about in biology the other day. it's something like making a hypothesis based on past data. it's based on the theory that all populations are alike and any abnormalities are due to chance alone. so if all the boys that i'm just friends with fall for me, all the boys that i continue to be just friends with will fall for me. at least in some way. i think i'm a likeable person. i think people feel relaxed around me. people are always telling me things and then saying i can't believe i just told you that. things just tend to slip out. so i may go see giant tonight. i think james dean is in that. my sister used to be a huge james dean fan. that's a main reason why i'm going. i love my sister. she is so smart and i was thinking last monday night that she has influenced me in many wonderful ways. i was at my friends house last night and jeremy started playing blackbird on the guitar. my sister and i shared a room for a while and she would always play that song as i was falling asleep. not because she wanted to play me a lullaby or anything, just because she was trying to teach herself guitar, which she did very well by the way. the other song she used to always play was, um , i forget the name but this guy was playing it on the street today. today it made me smile while the other night, black bird almost made me cry. i was in a sad emotional mood. i think i get moody right before and right after my period. the other night was right after. what was that song. it's by pink floyd. oh well. i really want to get my cd player back. it's up in denton at my x boyfriends place because i wasn't' going to need it this summer so i let him borrow it. i'll see him in a couple of weeks. i have mixed feelings about seeing him. i'm excited but scarred that i'm really not going to like him anymore. i think he's going to move to austin over christmas. i hope that works out. i also hope we can find some happy medium to our relationship. he was one of the reasons that i was so down the other night. i think i was lonely for a male companion or something. and i sort of have this crush on that guy jeremy. his roommates are jill and leslie. jeremy and jill used to date, but john, jeremy's best friend who i'm going to the movie's with tonight says that jeremy broke up with jill and that's why john is glad that jill has found another really nice guy to date. but i think that makes jeremy sort of regret breaking up with her because you can tell by watching them how much they still care for each other. it's kind of frustrating since i kind of like jeremy now. this sounds like some sort of soap opera. i've never been into watching those, although my sister used to watch days of our lives religiously. i'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this since there's no wrong or right answer. the assignment was to write for at least 20 minutes and that's it. so is somebody going to read this or are you just going to check off names to see that it was done. i think another reason i want to get this job, other than making money, well i guess it is making money because there are a lot of things i want to buy. every time i go to the book store i see this little disc man that i really want. i don't have a cd player here, remember? and i could use it in my car this summer. i really want a cd player for my car. well, if i get hired today, i will go out and reward myself by buying that disc man. i went to my friend jed's ranch this weekend. i came up with this awesome idea. i want to get a climbing harness and rig up some ropes so i can throw the rope over a tree limb, hook it back to me, and hitch myself up and sit among the tree branches. i think this is an awesome idea, so it probably already exists in some form or fashion. basically i'll need all the things they use to rappel down cliffs. i'm going to go the gym to check out the equipment and how it works to decide what kind of design i'll need. my 20 minutes are up. i think i went over, but i don't know by how much. wouldn't it suck if i accidentally hit the clear button instead of the submit button. i will have to be very careful. i just remembered that the other song my sister used to play was wish you were here by pink floyd.

i'm really thinking of nothing right now but then i start to think of the thing i will be heading out to in a few. my eyes are heavy and i can hear the printer shuffling is going around and my hands are getting kinda tired now. i hear someone in the back typing at the same speed and it makes me think they are doing the sam e thing i am doing. i had a long day and i'm tired but most of all i feel stupid. it's only the beginning of the semester and i just turned in my first calculus assignment and i didn't do it right i probably only did about 1'4 of it right. my eyes are getting really tired and head is now tilted to the right. my arms are sticking to the table and it really bothers me that i'm still pressing the back space and yet i keep doing it. i say my friend earlier and head is tilted to the left side now. right leg over left now. i want to go home and i can't head is itching now on the right side. timer isn't really bothering me now that i think about it. i guess it was the first thing i saw left leg over right eyes getting sleepily as though i'm putting myself to sleep and someone walked in but too lazy to look up cause i'm like in a trans right now. i've been typing forever and i'm still going . and going and going my back still hurts and now head is tilted to right i feel like breathing the way my aunt showed me and while back that can put my to sleep and i have to sneeze it's break time oh wait. it went back and leg is itching and the breaths are getting bigger and eyes are tired. it feels kinda nice right now and it feels as though it's cold outside and why and i so slouched back right now and i keep on messing up what i'm doing and that's bothering me and i'm still in the same spot and it's now been13 minutes and i'm ready to turn this thing off but i can' because i'm afraid of what will happen. will my grade be determined by the time and my legs have moved once again and arms are still in one spot. i wish it was christmas and i keep thinking in my head what the hell was that guy thinking and there's and itch on the shoulder and i should get it but i don't want to. ok it's bothering me. hand are rough and i'm still typing and i'm wondering what's going to go on after this and that girl that just walked in is loud and i believe blonde and i'm wondering if the girl . itch next ot me is wondering why i won't stop typing. ok time to sit up. i took a 5 sec break and now i'm back sitting up right and i've had about 3 itches already. so what was that guy thinking when he typed the directions of at universal remote? was that even it and damn it i'm still here typing away and i'm getting tired and head is now tilted the other way . i wonder why i do that a lot and my legs just moved and i'm just about done here and now my right eye itches and my right ear does too. ok that's done and now my stomach is itching and i'm thinking how bad my hands are hurting me and damn i've been typing forever and i'm still typing i can't believe i lasted this long and i'm still typing this just goes to show that i'm a dork that loves the computers. ok right arm is about to die and so my time is almost up and it's just done now bye! ,0,"[-1.533424, 1.130486, 1.623468, 0.035517, -0.409261, 0.386109, -1.078085, -1.815339, -1.954825, 0.988587, -0.042107, 0.076819, -2.079294, -0.121916, -1.09528, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.045709, 0.822729, -0.795527, 0.653814, -0.742368, -1.178671, -1.472522, 0.932666, 0.074252, -1.423689, -0.042092, -1.194262, -1.415596, -0.591104, -0.685008, -0.178567, -0.604892, -0.403734, 0.25051, -1.071801, -0.328603, -0.0293, -1.534833, 0.608064, -0.976385, -1.533351, 1.543734, 1.827617, -0.19886, 1.559153, -1.639174, -0.728146, -1.546678, -0.071162, 1.048827, 0.484952, -0.711757, -0.625285, 0.323973, 0.8044, -0.033819, 2.916779, -1.007402, 1.212669, -0.945032, -0.154509, -0.448863, 0.337408, -0.280398, -0.086094, -0.88553, -1.364578, -0.073676, -0.23436, -0.208271, -0.236439, -0.337085, -0.422267, 1.547794, -0.451544, -0.213847, -0.808875, 4.633576, 3.804656, 4.920837, 4.68344, 3.780284]"
"as of right now, i'm pretty happy with my life. the only thing that i question are relationship issues. after breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 6 months ago, i haven't dated any other person. i think i'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend"" lifestyle. the girls i have met as friends i might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they weren't, again because i missed having a girlfriend. recently, i've gotten over the issue a bit. i've spent time with all my friends. that's the good thing about being single, you have more time for your friends. when i was going out for my ex, which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years, i didn't have much time for friends. not only that, but i chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends. this issue of mine, it's made me a bit more self conscious. i got the idea in my head that looks really do matter. seriously though, having a ""deep"" relationship is important and yadda yadda,but i really do feel that looks matter too. a friend and i were discussing this. she is been there for me a lot. when i broke up with my ex-girlfriend, she was there for me to complain to. anyways, she said that looks don't matter and it only matters a small percentage of time. i argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that's what matters at the very beginning. i met this very interesting girl this summer. her name is serena. she was telling me about her past, how she was somewhat of a ""geek"" in high school. she didn't care about her looks or anything. she is a very bright girl, very deep. likes art and many things most girls just don't take interest anymore. she said that she realized she felt she had to start dressing up to attract people first, then and only then would they be able to see the ""real"" side of her. i completely agree with this. there is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow. ever since then, i've gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features. i never did care about it much. i was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others didn't really enter my mind. during this recent period, i've started to lift weights a bit and work out my body. another thought of relationships i've always wondered is at what point do you really have to ""settle""? the reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl. when you date someone, how far into the future should you consider? unfortunately for me, i should've realized in my last relationship that there was no future. instead, because of my fear of being alone, i stayed with her. for nearly 3 years. it was fun and all, but we had many arguments. the reality was we were two different people. two different backgrounds, interests, ideas, practically everything. my parents didn't like her because she wasn't chinese and wasn't very bright. (i'm chinese by the way). i'd like to talk about my family for a second. i was born in taiwan, and moved to the usa when i was four. thus, i speak'write fluent english but can only speak chinese(mandarin) since i still speak it at home. i would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional, which i really like. like most chinese families, my parents stressed educational when i was growing up. sometimes i think this is why there is the stereotype of ""asians being smarter in school"". i think it's because traditionally, chinese families stress education a bit more than others. the bad thing about growing up in a ""traditional"" family is that living in the usa, i did not experience certain american family activities. my dad never took me fishing, camping, or anything ""fatherly"". i think that was one of the things i really disliked about him. growing up, i always favored my mom more. now that i'm in college, i talk to my dad a lot more when i go back home, including cars, sports, politics, etc. going home, i'm spoiled with food. my mom is always thinking i'm going to starve to death. everytime i come back up to austin, she makes me bring a whole bunch of food. my grandparents(dad's side) also lives very close to me in houston. my grandparents came to the usa a couple of years before us, which is how we were able to. i remember growing up and laying awake at night, my biggest fear in the world was that i'd lose my grandpa (to old age). it's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever. we've tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him, but he just won't. he says he has nothing better to do during the daytime, and to let him enjoy it. he is even said something close to ""i've already experienced everything in life. my family is doing good. i have nothing else to live for"" now, don't take this to be a suicidal comment for anything, he was saying it as if it were wise words. on my part, its hard to argue with him. he is my grandpa and i can't really tell him to just stop what he likes so much. personally, i have a very big problem with talking to people. this problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college. since there are so many people around, it's hard to not get use to it. when i'm around people, i'm always worried that what i say will make them think negatively of me. that's why i'll usually always rethink what i want to say in my mind before i actually say it. funny thing is, my chinese name translated to english is ""brave speaker"". i know i have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but i just can't help it. growing up i didn't have that many friends, so i thought to myself a lot and that's still true. around strangers, i'm really quiet. only around friends am i a bit more active. and my 20 minutes are up. this was pretty useful. glad i could type out what i was thinking. now i got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book. the lectures are much more interesting.

"all i can really think about is how incredibly tired i am. my sleeping schedule has been severely altered. i stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 every night studying, then to get up at 7:00 or so to go to class. surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, i am not especially stressed although i never seem to be. the only thing i ever stress about in jason, mandi, and some of my other troubled friends. jason really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). i worry about him all the time. not that i don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. i just think that maybe if i worry about it, it will do some good. there's my logic as usual it's very skewed. i am so incredibly tired. i can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that i lead the most unproductive life at ut. this really isn't the case. i just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness i suppose not necessarily unproductive. people can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. this difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, i am not capable of articulating it. i can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. i have biology in an houri don't want to go, but i know i will. i haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. the one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. i suppose this is a good thing though. i am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. there is something strangely humorous about it again; i can't even begin to articulate what it is. just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. my sense of humor is rather odd. i have gathered this from several sources: the fact that monty python is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that i can laugh at anything without having any real reason. random laughter. it's good in some ways. this doesn't look like twenty minutes of writing, but i suppose that if i have been typing for twenty minutes, then this is twenty minutes worth of writing. i am so smart i amaze others and myself.

"i am so mad right now. i have tried so many times to go to the internet site for this class, and it says error. the url. i am upset. this thing is due friday. so now i'm in word, waiting for the stupid site to be fixed. i just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense. there was a party in the town i am from, and some guy got stabbed and died. he was 35 and from san antonio. the weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed him. now to me this makes no sense. they were at a party. there are usually people everywhere. oh well. i have a lot of stuff to do. me and allison are going apartment hunting tomorrow. it's weird, i've only known her since i moved here in august, and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year. we want to live at orange tree because it's cute. i looked on the internet for some info on it, and there is none. i think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in september for a place we won't move into for almost a year. oh well, we are doing it now so we don't get screwed. i was just talking to corey, my cute boyfriend, and i was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans. i always tell him what i've learned in class because it helps me remember it. i feel sorry for him, i wouldn't want to hear it if i were him. he's so nice like that. i ordered cookies last night from tiffany's treats, they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door. anyway, i was in a friend's room at hardin housewhich i hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff. i told them i want to get married on november 19, 2005 to corey. they laughed and asked why, so i told them. we've actually talked about marriage, and we both love each other that much, so it's cool. we want to live together in a couple of years. actually he is going to live near us at orange tree if at all possible. he has a brother who is a year younger, codey, who is a pothead. he has a girlfriend amy, who i don't like. she's only a freshman in high school, but she doesn't belong with him. corey and codey are total opposites. i have a lot of work to do. tonight i have to do calculus, read for my freshman seminar, and do my italian work. i got a quiz back today from that class, and i got a 75. i was so upset. i'm used to a's. italian is not a required course for my major, so i was wondering if i could take it pass'fail. that would be good, then it couldn't bring down my gpa. i need to ask some one about that. i hate my roommate and suitemate. they are so damn loud. caroline, the suitemate has people over now who are very loud. i like it quite, but that doesn't happen here at hardin house. i went through rush this year and got a bid from a chi o, but i decided not to pledge. i am glad i didn't because they are out all of the time, and i'm taking 16 hours this and every other semester. i want to finish in three years, so i have to take 16 hours every semester, and 6 in each summer session. that's cool with me though, since i don't feel really comfortable here. my dad is an accountant for the floresville isd, in floresville, tx. we don't have the major bucks, which is totally opposite from the girls that live here. we aren't poor by any means. i have a 2000 eclipse which my dad got me for my birthday last year. my brother is premed here at ut. actually, he's supposed to graduate in december. he took an extra semester to take some business courses. he's really smart, but he likes to party. he was a fiji, and that is just a synonym for partier. i don't like to party much at all. if i didn't have corey, i'd probably party, but i'm just not compelled to get drunk on friday and saturday and spend sunday recuperating. that is not my idea of a good time. it used to be though. my sophomore year, i was the party queen. i have never done drugs in my life. no pot, coke, or anything. i did drink a lot, but i don't anymore. the last time i got drunk was a ""roundup"" in april. i threw up on my own shoe. needless to say, i don't do that anymore. corey has never been drunk before. he's so innocent to meet, but only i know the ""real"" him. i think that's cool. i just got an email from my exboyfriend. we dated for almost a year and a half, but i had to break up with him because i liked corey more. me and corey will have been together for 10 months on 092000. he's so wonderful. i'm obsessed with him, which is okay by me. i'd do anything for him. my birthday is the day of the houston game. my family is coming down and so is corey (he's only a senior). we are planning on going to hudson's on the bend, which is one of my absolute favorite places ever. we ate at the oasis on friday. we got lost, but it was still fun. i was so scared when we got to my brother's house. he lives on the east side of 35 which is really scary. we were trying to unlock the door, and a car parked across the street and watched up get in.

"i'm still trying to figure out why i always procrastinate. i think i like to work under pressure, i have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. i wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. i hope the second because i have never been one to study, and i would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? i thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, i can already tell i'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, i already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life i want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. i'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. i'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. i read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was satan or the grim reaper or something like that. i think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. i hope bush wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, i am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. i just believe bush will do a lot better job than kerry, and the whole vietnam thing i just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while i don't know everything about it, i was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people i heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. i just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. i wish i could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. i wish i could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but i don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but i don't really know what happened there, i guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. i realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because i am thinking about how long it is, or i'm not doing an activity i find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun, i'm surprised i woke up for it. i missed class the other day when i slept through it and it was at 12. that's just strange, getting up at the 8 one, but oversleeping the 12. i wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor i met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which i would agree with although i haven't experienced life after school, but i think it will be hell.

"for the past couple of weeks, i have been wondering about one question: why am i here? as i go from class to class i look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. what are they waiting for? should i be waiting for something? a lot of changes have happened to me in the past 3 weeks. as these changes take place, i wonder, ""i guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. if i were to ask someone as i walk by, ""why are you here at ut?"" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, ""i don't know"" or ""that's a good question. "" so with that said, i ask myself, ""why am i here?"" i guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. if that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? michael dell is a prime example. he is not your everyday college dropout. he is making more money than probably 97 percent of college graduates. so is college a way of evening everyone out? someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the american dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the american dream, but got it spoiled by being ""brainwashed"" in college. so what exactly does ""brainwashed"" mean? everywhere i have been in college, there are professors talking about, ""when you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. "" nonsense. i don't want to work for someone. nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. i don't want to have to ""use"" my degree when i ""get a job.

"the day is over again and still so much to do and to think about. i hope my parents are settling down up in colorado with good business and a place to live. i hope no conflicts will occur although i know they are going to fight one in awhile. i miss my mom the most. she cried at the airport and i can still see those tears in her face. her voice was so weak when i called to say hello. is this it to college life? i wonder where tim is has he called me and left me a message? i have precal class with him first thing tomorrow morning and i don't know where to go yet. i hope to get my beeper soon because i needed really bad and i don't know when ill get it. as i look at the screen i wonder if the writing will ever go down onto the next line, or will it go on forever. i really want to go home i feel as though i have to be with her 24'7 and i feel like she'll follow me everywhere i go. i don't want her to , but at the same time i don't want to hurt her feelings. i hate it when she smokes she smelt so bad in the classroom wow it finally has moved down to the second line. this stream of conscious writing is kinda pain in the butt because it is nearly impossible to actually start typing without thinking about what to type. lookin at the screen uhhh she wants to come over today but i don't want her to i feel as though she's gonna stick with me wherever i go and i feel like she's never gonna find a friend to hang out without me. but i shouldn't think like this because she's my friend and we've known each other forever. but i feel that she's going to hold me back in the future as we go on. either that or we're gonna fall apart, not easily, but i feel that someone's gonna get hurt and i don't want to be the one hurting her. my head itches. i gotta go home and call my mom and talk to my dad. i wish they had the same kind of water here as colorado. their water is so nice. i would like to know if tim likes me or just as friends because he actually we act the same way towards each other but i don't know if i like him or not so i wonder if he feels the same way. my pastor is here from dallas to teach bible study and i kinda feel guilty because i said i'd see him and stuff when he is down here but i cant get my self to go and sit and listen to him. i feel bad. i wonder what lee is doing he seem so quiet yet outgoing but not really i would like to get to know him but i wonder if he even knows that i exist. i think he does but who knows. sitting here typing wondering what time it is . what can i eat for dinner? i have an eye appointment tomorrow and i want to meet tim somewhere so we can go to class together. cant wait to go home i'm kinda glad i didn't room with her i can't imagine how hurt she'll be if she really knows how i feel. she gets on my nerves time to time and she asks me if she gets on my nerves, but i can never tell her that she does because i don't think its right. i want my friends to come over to my apartment but i don't know how my roommate is going to react. how am i suppose to find a roommate for next semester when she leaves . it almost time to go i hope they don't make us read this later on in the semester. i think i really want a boyfriend but not really, i don't know what i want. michael is pretty cute only if he was taller i would fall for him so hard. but i'm glad we're good friends. i'm kinda glad that they broke up too. i think she's too self fish and he can do so much better. i better memorize the medical terminology by thursday. what should i do this weekend i bet she wants to come with me i feel as though every time i'm with her i'm blocked off from the crowd in a way i'm uncomfortable with her around other people. i wish she stop smoking she looked so crappy up times up and i don't feel like typing any more.

"i know i should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really i'm just bored as hell. i think i can honestly say that i never imagined myself doing something like this. i guess it's something i always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. then again, i consider myself an insomniac. but like i said. here we are. my only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after i finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. how sad. she is like my mom. she wakes me up in the mornings when i oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. food is my only motivation. meh. in other news, the ut body project is going well. i got paid $30 for the seminar i attended yesterday. they want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. somehow i don't see that happening. on a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. it's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. my poor baby. i'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. so for now, it's sitting in a dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. so it's hard for me to access my closet. but oh well. who needs clothes anyway. my roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. this could be a disaster. she is also trying to read what i'm writing, claiming that i'm talking trash about her. . everything she is heard is true. and, because i'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, i'll delve a little bit into my personal life. i wrote an e-mail to s (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. though he wasn't technically gone. he went to harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. speaking of which, because harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th i think. it sux0rz. fortunately, i asked arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. which means. my roommate angela and i might go visit them up in boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. but i digress. then again i guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing i actually am digressing. ok i'm not going to confuse myself further. anyway. back to the e-mail. right. so i wrote it, and he got back on tuesday, as he said he would. but by the i'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. unfortunately, i don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old pos computer. oh well. it wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. except a lot longer. i forget what the point of this story was. oh well. i guess what i'm trying to say is that a) the donnie darko soundtrack is very good, and b) i miss him a lot. a lot a lot. he is going to have fun up at harvard with his friends, while i'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. it's so depressing. i don't really like it down here. i miss saikat, and arjun, and amit. bah. i really need to update my journal sometime soon. i think oftentimes, i make such an effort to make the entries i write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if i'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, i just won't update. what a shame. i need to stop caring about how i write and start worrying about what i write. people don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. oh poo. in other news, the movie ""the good girl"" is really good. it helped me to explore some aspects of my life that i'd never given much thought to. i guess i should have.

"it is 9:35 and i am beginning my stream of consciousness writing assignment. i have been at the university of texas for exactly one week today. the first night i got here was probably the most alone i have ever felt. my roommate is my best friend from the town where i came from, pearland. my other best friend was visiting us also. i'm not sure why i felt that way, i was surrounded by two of the people i feel most comfortable around. i'm sure it had to do with being in a different town, sleeping in a different bed, etc. i'm sure i'll learn all about that in this class. i didn't realize i would miss my parents as much as i miss them. i'm an only child and i never really considered myself that close to them. actually, i am very close to my mom about certain things. as i've gotten older sometimes she just feels like one of my friends. at any rate i really miss them. they didn't call that whole weekend, and i realize it was because my mom didn't want to bother me, but it kind of hurt my feelings. so, i called them. this is really going to help out my typing i can tell it's getting faster. it's 9:46 now. i think when i get through with this i'm going to go to my other friends from pearland's room and watch a movie or something. it's so easy to not mean new people when you already have friends. there's about 25 people from my home town here. i've met new people in my classes and everything, but these are the people i spend all of my time with. we'll see what happens in the future. before i left pearland i had been dating a guy who's going to sam houston. we weren't that serious, but now i miss him a lot. we were talking about what we were going to do and i had just assumed we would break up because we would be far away but he didn't see it like that. he had like a list of reasons we should or shouldn't stay together. at any rate, i told him i had to experience new things in college, blah, blah, blah, and we basically decided to break up. it's 9:54 but i'll keep writing a little more. i liked this guy on and off for like a year. well, now i really kind of regret not staying together because i miss him. he came down to pearland the wednesday before i left and we hung out. i called him a couple days ago and he didn't sound very happy to hear from me. okay, well now i'm rambling, i guess now i'm going to have to move on. oh well we'll see what happens. it's 10:00. this was kind of fun.

"well, i'm thinking right now about how thinking about what i'm going to write is going to effect what i'm going to write. i'm thinking that 20 minutes is a long time to write considering that i type at a fairly good clip. i'm thinking i won't start each sentence with i think. i've come up with the idea for the perfect television show. it'll be a cross between chips and pacific blue. it'll be about moped cops in missouri, it'll be called m. o. p. d. it'll star katie holmes and busta rhymes as the street savy ex con turned cop. no one on the force knows if he can be trusted, but he's found a friend in katie, or sam mcgillaway on the show. i've decided that i really like fencing, and that at least at this early state i have a better mastery of the sport than most people in my class. i'm really thinking that this is going to be hard to to for twenty minutes. i miss my girlfriend. my ear itches. my roomate displaces much ground when he walks, or at least it sounds as if he does. i guess that's me thinking about my sensory preception. i hear him playing quake in the background, or should i say, behind my head. i wonder if i'll get full credit for my diff eq assignment. do teenage cats drink hairspray so their hairballs will look good? always wondered that. it's amazing how well i can get my ideas to flow from my brain to my hands. i'm sure it's a combination of my typing savvy and my slowing of the thought process so i can type everything i think. my roomate's whistling the daily show theme. i like john stewart movies. i like patrick stewart movies. i wonder how many degrees it would take to connect him to kevin bacon. i wonder how i come up with connections like this. my instant messanger sounds are starting to get on even my nerves. i wonder how i'll do this semester. i know the 5hrs of credit i got for spanish will help my gpa, but will they offset the potential disaster that is either diff eq and or computer science 310? do i really want to be a computer science major? i really like cooking. bam!. that's what emeril says. it's only been 5 minutes since i last looked at the clock, and that was maybe a total of 10 minutes ago. hmm. minutes and minutes were in the same position on those two lines. although they may not be when you read this. i wonder if my roomate's going to play the same song he always does. i miss home, mostly because of my girlfirend. i wonder if i'm supposed to put a comma in the name field. if obi wan kenobi has the ability to run with incredible speed, then why does he wait for the force field things to close and thus causing the death of his mentor. what's the deal with all the star wars major light sabre scenes (or most of them) ending with some guy falling down a large pit'shaft type thing? is george lucas trying to tell us something? i can hear real songs in my roomate's playing. neither of us have been playing that long. i just showered, but my nose already feels oily. i think my leg's asleep. there's two asses in assassination. i think my whole leg is asleep, or getting there fast. i'm not used to sitting normally in my chair, but i did it to facilitate my typing. i wonder if facil or something like that is a latin root. spanish for easy is facil. facilitate means to make easy. makes sense to me. sounds like my roomate's trying to learn the solo to breakfast at tiffanie's. it's not that hard. i wonder if i'm catching mostly audio cues because my eyes are focused on a particular task? that's my guess. well, that looks like about 20 minutes ",1,"[1.157875, -0.171804, -0.552018, -0.2194, -0.814546, 0.408481, 0.257684, 0.023185, 0.154854, 0.144164, -0.199428, 0.820656, 0.29849, -1.675071, 0.672808, 0.0, -0.04277, -0.30932, 0.213515, -0.341462, 0.133322, -0.521803, -0.23854, -0.631956, -0.624052, 0.182283, 0.224797, 0.029866, -1.640815, -0.741231, -1.100231, -0.124019, -1.565131, -0.906028, -1.017959, -0.39455, 0.311094, 1.404285, 1.461025, -0.73689, -0.497721, 0.319351, -1.133571, 1.038429, 1.016278, 0.980001, -0.222039, -0.752351, -0.590493, -0.58702, -0.867977, -0.913085, -0.555293, -0.740642, 0.519781, -0.997439, -0.328127, -0.349488, -1.130635, 0.073101, -0.075681, -0.452321, -0.480161, -0.745201, -0.159511, 0.956571, -0.086094, 0.277065, -0.266418, -0.073676, -0.23436, 0.967313, -0.193836, -0.337085, -0.422267, 1.289526, 0.415497, 0.103524, 0.504006, 4.655101, 3.327717, 4.924297, 5.0402, 4.86395]"

"well today is my birthday and i am excited. i turn 19. i am no longer just 18 and not quite 21 but somewhere in the middle. today, i go up at 12:00 in the afternoon. i hate having to wake up so late because my day feels as if it is half gone. i guess that is why i'm here in the computer lab trying to complete these assignments. i am a little disappointed in myself because this assignment was originally due on friday, but because some people were having difficulty with the computers the deadline was extended to monday. that is great. i felt awkward because i had not completed the assignment not because i had computer problems but because i was to lazy to do the assignment. i have one problem i think in life and that is that i have too many friends. that seems like a weird thing to say, but it is true. i came to austin with not one single friend or any family up here and for some reason i have many friends. i ask my friend jina, do i look like a people-person, because people are just coming up to me and wanting to be my buds. i think that is so great. most people would usually get very nervous and would not try to continue an conversation with complete strangers, but i try. once you make the effort to reach put to people you will realize that there is a lot of people wanting to be your friend. i did something in the cafeteria the other day. i was running a way different schedule than my other friends, so i went to the cafeteria alone. i was thinking to myself, great i have to just eat and not talk to anyone. i was not going to do that so i say this guy sitting by himself. he looked decent and it wasn't as if i had any physical attraction to him. i just sneezed right now, two times. no one said bless you. i just thought that was weird. any was back to my story. i went and sat down with him and we ate dinner together. it turns out that he is from san antonion also. wow so i see him every now and then and we say hi to each other. i know this guy, his name is carlitos. his is the coolest. everywhere we go he knows someone. he goes to school at swt but he knows people at ut and utsa. i want to be someone who has friends everywhere. i have been doing a successful job so far, considering that i'm a freshman. i really like it here at ut. i am making friends, doing reasonably well in my classes, i have an easy job at the mic in the ssb. to me the ssb is a great building and i talk about it everyone should know but everyone doesn't know about it and i think that is interesting. a building designed to help students and many don't know about it. i understand that the freshman don't know about it but professors and upperclass students don't know about the ssb. my hands are tired of typing and i have 5 minutes left to write. i like this psy class except that i want to fall asleep in the class. i probably should of scheduled the class for an earlier time. actually i that i think about it i did try but tex was not working to my favor so i stayed with that time. i hope i get accepted to do the experiments because i surely do not want to do a research project. tonight we plan on drinking some beer and having some pizza for my birthday. last night when the clock struck 12:00 midnight, my best friend from school poured beer on me. we also dropped ashes from each others cigarette into each others beer and drank it. that is our new tradition we will carry on for years. jeanie is a great friend. i wish she would come to ut instead of swt, i know she wants to . well time is up so bye.

"i really don't know how to use the internet and i have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant i am. i really wish that i did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like i will really have to use it in medicine. i wish my dad would subscribe t o the internet at home. oh well at least during the christmas vacation i probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. i wish my dad had not held me to that deal, i mean what if i flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. forget the car i just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the christmas holiday just incase i fail. you know i am really scared what if i really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get into medical school and i happen to fail, what if i became a doctor and all my patients died on me will i be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. i really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so i can see what courses i should be taking and when i can fit them in so i can graduate in four years. you know what this is a stupid assignment because i am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. you know if i had been a braver soul i would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. what kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to mrs. whitenight i cant believe i didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, i suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. i mean really since i suffered and improved each and every day in her class i should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what i could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score it sounds really silly, but who cares i don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and you know mrs. dubner should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair i mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. this is almost over thank you god i never want to do this again but i have to. yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad i cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing i have friends like jean and rosemary. i still haven't talked to dina and i could not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from regina the nerve of her trying to steal my major. i mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to richardson she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than i am. i can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction i am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and i can get me a tutor so i can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. i hope i beat enough so that i graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( i could care less). rosemary is a cool roommate , i sort of getting a little tired of jean i mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend i hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. today i am supposed to start jogging i hope i can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself i think. i know i have to call my parents i am especially worried about my mom i mean ever since the death of princess diana she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone i hope she gets over it soon. i hope when i am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, i can't believe jean and rosemary got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift i have received from anyone since i got my cowboys' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that was the last birthday i got present from my parents at all. you know in the two weeks i have been here i have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because i think i was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. maybe i'll see him during the christmas holiday maybe i wont maybe i'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way i shouldn't be thinking about that right now i'll think about it later when i am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really

"ok, i'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. mtv is on in the background, and i'm remembering when i went to see them in concert at jamboree in tinley park ,il. everyone thinks i'm crazy because i came from il all the way to texas. i don't feel crazy though. i wanted a change and i really love it down here. i wonder what taveau is doing right now. she isn't answering my e-mail. ok, it's only been a day , i'm just being impatient. anyway, i wonder why she doesn't go by taveau. i like it a whole lot better than melanie. and i seriously wonder if she's straight or not. i just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. i hate hanson. they're such one hit wonders. and the one hit is called mmmmmbop. how incredibly stupid is that? they're like a younger , related new kids. speaking of new kids, how about spice girls? there's another total lack of talent engineered for success. it's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. what's a great idea? that commercial just said something was a great idea. i know what a great idea would be: if i would start to do my calculus homework. sometimes i wonder if i actually want to pass that class. i wonder what i could do to welcome daniela-my roommate-back home after this weekend. god, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. i guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. i don't know, i guess i just don't understand that level of dependence. then again i moved from joliet, il to austin, tx with exactly eight minutes of crying. i wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. chris rock is so funny. i love this commercial. whoever had the idea of having chris rock in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. god, i hope jewel doesn't come on . that one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. i do miss them , but i don't really miss my parents all that much . daniela is always telling me how cold that is , but i can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how i feel. ok, jewel did come on, but at least it was just you were meant for me, oops i just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. i'm so dumb with computers, i swear. i know so much less about them than all the people around me. i'm confident i'll learn, but i just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her plan 2 group. she's really screwy. she doesn't even know if her computer is a pc or a mac. i guess i'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am i supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. oh well. jamiroquai's on now. i saw him in concert too. oh, that just made me a little sad. we all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang freshmen together, and , i don't know. i feel like i'm babbling, but i guess that's pretty much the whole point. i remember dr. pennebaker telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. well, i don't really care if anyone reads this or not. i 'm not really saying much of anything. i don't even feel like i'm saying anything important. i wonder if i should have put on that survey thing that i was bisexual. not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because i could upset the demographics of their study. oh well, i'll let them deal with that. time's up. i hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this.

"i have a campbell's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder (a tribute to andy warhol) and i am watching it now. my desk is a bit cluttered. purses, markers, papers with assignments that need to be done, a dr pepper can. i am unsure what to write. i began a painting today, and did not finish it. my dorm doesn't feel as though it's a creative environment, but i suppose the dorm won't change. so either i have to change my perspective, or not paint at all. my eyes are heavy, and i am cold, because my hair is wet and squeaky clean. my hands are warmer than usual (they are usually as cold as ice, or very near as such), and i shall have to remember to tell my mother, because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating. it is ten to midnight. my mind is active, but i lack in motivation. i am excited about this new life i have, as a college freshman, but i am also extremely nervous. i must do as well as possible this year, so that i won't have to return back home to a run-of-the-mill local college (as my dad has threatened if i don't succeed in producing a pretty-looking gpa), and also my future as an architect (the career which i would like to pursue) is depended solely upon my performance this year. i did not get into the architecture program this year, and should like to transfer in as a sophomore. i have run out of things to discuss. i miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home. i had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that i have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat. i brought only the bare minimum of books with me, my art books, of course, and my absolute fave novels, one of them being a wrinkle in time. i am fully aware that it is a young adult novel, and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite, but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless. my room smells of the body wash i use (energizing citrus, i love it) and stale mr. gatti's pizza. there is a faint tinge of acrylic-paint smell. my roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit. my bed is full of pillows, two black hearts and a red furry one, and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me. i am, for once, not hungry. but merely satiated, as i feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger. i have less than seven minutes to go! i wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo. in what way do you benefit from reading this? i can't imagine how anything could come of this, except perhaps extreme boredom, or maybe resentment. there is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend's subdivision in georgetown, holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such, and every time we drive by her, i think: that has got to be by far the worst job in the world. she stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on, holding a bent sign and a jug of water. and i can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is: i am a pole. "" yes, ladies and gentlemen, with one simple gesture, a stick could be stuck in the ground, and the sign pasted onto it, and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job, and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up, and it just kills me. and i am glad i am not her. i am glad i am not a whole bunch of people. the end.

"" i am, however, not the slightest bit saudi even though the experience has had a wonderful and great impact on my life. what brought my parents, dan and karen, to arabia in the 1st place was the huge amount of oil. my father is a geologist and a graduate of ut. my parent's have been visiting me here in texas and are leaving tomorrow back to saudi:-( i'm used to the good-byes though so although i am quite sad it is something that i have learned to get used to. i attended a little all girls boarding school in mclean, va for the past 3 years so i guess my transition went quite a but smoother than that of my fellow freshmen. well. i am getting bored of talking about myself so i guess i'll move on to something else. i just returned from ut's caving society meeting. it was by far the most interesting experience of my day. well. to begin. there were no other ut students from the looks of things excluding the friends that i went with. instead i ran into a ton of my parents old family friends. my parents met while caving with the ut club in mexico ages ago and my uncle tr was the famous old president of the club ages ago and discovered some huge cave in mexico. i had know idea what i was getting myself into when i happened to see a little flyer about the meeting and am so excited about caving in the near-by future. this weekend i'm going camping with my sister, katie, and we're supposed to do some caving while we are there so i'm psyched! only 2 more day to go! bye!

"let's see. i'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. not that she's not a cool person or anything, i just can concentrate better when i'm alone and when it is quiet. but that is almost impossibe here in jester. there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. like right now! oh well, it is something i must get used to. or i can do what i did last night. wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night. my fingers are freezing! this room is so cold! i haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. i'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket. i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i cannot wear shorts like i used to back at home. aw, home! i think i am starting to miss being at home. i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. this, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. i do go back home on thursday night, but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta. i am competing in a sports tournament for my church. i am playing flag football and running track. another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i've been dating for less than a month. well, i've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. it's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that, but only because i didn't want to be mean. he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. that was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, i really don't care anymore. he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met. i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. a week after we broke things off, this new guy i'm dating told me he had feelings for me. i was so confused and didn't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks. but i'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. because of that, i decided that i'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. we decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. my ex found out and was extremely jealous. it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. but oh well, that's life i guess. i am really glad i continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. i spent every day with him until the day i left. i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. he is amazing. the only thing i'm worried about is that i'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i don't think i'm quite ready for another one. that's the only problem i'm having right now. the fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. but the distance might become an issue. it was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. but yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut. but i am definitely loving it here in austin. i enjoy all of my professors and classes. having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. in addition i am taking this psychology class, which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. other than that i have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment. ah, my hands are still so cold. what do i do?! my ears are feeling very cold too. must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room?! or my bad, it is the fall now. same thing. today is the day for my mile run. ever since i moved to austin, i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym. i absolutely love that place! and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester. freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape! i find that i've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer. i really love this lifestyle i have at ut. the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but i do not feel like i am abusing it. i did party a lot this weekend, but i didn't drink or anything. people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. i don't want people to view me as a party girl because i'm not out of control or anything. oh well. i see that this writing is almost up. that wasn't too bad!

" i just came back from the texas crew meeting. i sort of want to try out but in the same time very scared. at the meeting, they kept on saying there'll be a lot of hard work and pain. first of all, i don't think i'm in that great of a shape to do such extreme rowing. the crew memebers said it doesn't matter because they will train you from nothing to something. second of all, i'm a freshman and doing pre-pharmacy. i want a good gpa to start off of. i don't know how i'm going to adjust to waking 5 o'clock in the morning. i guess one of the reason i wanted to join is because to challenge myself and make some new friends. more than 100 people from my graduating class comes to ut now. before school ended, i got very tired of many of the people. i felt they were very fake. i came to ut hoping to make some friends. i still wanted to keep my old friends though. i truly love them. they mean so much to me. what i'm trying to say is that it's hard to find friendships like that. everyone on my floor seems nice. they smile at me and everything but it seems like they are always in a rush. everyone has their own things to do and no time to hang out. anyways, i'm watching american idol right now and they just announced that kelli as the american idol. i never thought the show would be such a hit. wb used to have this show called pop star. not that many people watched it so i wasn't expecting a great rating for this show. the time is almost up so i guess that is it for today. it was very nice writing.

"philosophy. can one truly think that one knows nothing? if one truly thinks that one knows nothing, doesn't that mean that he in fact truly knows something. that he knows nothing. if god is omnipotent can he make a rock so heavy he can't carry it? god. if he were the perfect god why hasn't he made himself present to the entire world? how can this world think so highly of itself that it thinks it has found the right religion already. maybe the true god has never been seen, has never been thought, has never been written down before. there always exists the possibility that perhaps the world came about in a way no one has every thought of before. it's possible and very probable. can one truly put all his faith in god. if god is an almighty, omnipotent being, can one put his entire life into god's hands? but then god says not to be foolish. is it foolish to want an explanation. maybe the confusion is meant for a reason. have to get an application to college of engineering. to be a genius wouldn't be so bad. it wouldn't be that great either. everything has its ups and downs, black, white, heaven, hell, etc. perhaps the goal is to reach a true balance. maybe then we'll be content. then again to be content and balanced you would have to have some discontent. fashion is definitely too emphasized in this world. when will comfort be in? it will probably take off like a forest fire. people will realize there are plenty of more important things than clothes and appearance. of course that doesn't mean stop bathing and wearing dirty clothes. people need to get priorities straight. why waste your time taking a speeding ticket to court. time is money. time is more valuable than money. without time we are nothing. without money, we are without money. time will never wait nor come back. smurfs. i remember smurfs. back in the childhood days when things weren't so complicated. a tiny blue creature was simply a tiny blue creature. not a tiny conniving blue wench searching for self promotion or upholding a social image or making the extra buck. it was a time of snowmen and berry fights and rope swinging and rock climbing and tadpole watching. nothing more, nothing less but perhaps invaluable.

"well, i suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did i wait this long to get assignments like this done. i always put a lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off. i haven't been doing in college so far, but i know if i was more productive with my time i'd be better off. that and money. i haven't been very good with money lately. oh, i have plenty to live on, but i spend a lot of money on things i simply don't need. i also tend to spend money unwisely, like buying things somewhere when i know i can get them somewhere else much cheaper, but i buy it anyways because it's there and convenient. i don't have any income right now eithher, i need a work-study job, but that shouldn't be too hard. i've already paid my rent for the semester, and so a job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine. i've got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people, too. the unfortunate thing is, it's getting to a point where it's almost a home-run business, and i'm beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue. i hate filling out forms, much less loads of tax forms. i'm only 18, and it's a thing i do on the side to make extra money, and i don't know if i should be concerned with such a thing as business tax forms and accounting. i've only done three small commerical webpages . . i don't know if that excuses me from anything. i need to talk to some expert about that. money is no object to me, in the end, though. that's probably why i'm so careless about most of it. i have been keeping a pretty tight track of it, though, just to make sure i don't go broke. i'm looking at buying a computer, and i think i have just enough. my work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses. i also spend a good bit on music, which is something i'm really into. not music in general, mind you, but just the stuff i listen too. a lot of it is fairly obscure . . i'm not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure. i listen to a good bit of forgotten artist's stuff, like albums they release after they've had their heydey - which is usually in the 80s. i listen to music basically all the time. my roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time, sometimes i wonder if he minds, but i don't think he does. we have a guitar in our room, and it's my roommate's. he doesn't play it too often, only a bit now and then. he's decent. i don't know anything, though. i'm not muscially inclined, personally, in any way. i don't sing or play any insturments, though i wish i did. something like keyboards or drums would be cool, but i've been learning to apprecaite the guitar more. i like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make. steve hackett, when he was a guitarist for genesis way back when, is a great example. i heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized, and as a result, he played some interesting solos. he made the band sound a little more floyd-ish i guess. still, that's the kind of guitar i'd like to learn to play. acoustic riffs would be neat to learn, too. the keyboards would be tough, but i'd think the most fun to play could be the drums. drummers have a lot of different styles, i've noticed. i wouldn't leanr to play really fast and make a lot of noise, i would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesn't take just speed, but lots of skill, too. i don't know how most bands play it now a days, but drums don't always particularly stand out in some songs now a days, but i guess a lot of them don't hold that as important. when phil collins was drummer for genesis, the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out. not because they were loud, neccessarily, but because they were different with what you usually heard. they didn't go along with the song, they would almost lead the song. really, though, all of the members of the band genesis make it such a great band, which if you haven't caught on by now, is my favorite band. i'm getting a little tired and i have lot more reading and some homework to do. tomorrow is monday and classes start up again. fun.

"well i guess my first thought would be that i don't think the assignment is really fair. i don't really mind it but the fact is that people who type faster will in fact have to write more. i type quite well so this applies to me. i don't really know what else to say so i guess i will just talk. i am 18 i don't like things. i don't like a lot of things. i am very judging of people and things. everywhere i go i am sizing things up. i don't know why i do this, perhaps it is some sort of defense mechanism that i use to protect myself. i don't know once again. i have a girlfriend of seven months who has actually helped me with this very much. just the thought of her brings me comfort and calms me down considerably. i don't sleep very well anymore. i used to sleep quite well but now that all of these changes in my life have occurred i am having trouble adjusting. one thing i have noticed about myself just now is that i complain a lot. well, i noticed it before now but this helps. i will try to be more positive for the rest of the time. i like things. i like a lot of things. i like music, especially the dave matthew's band. i am going to go to a concert of theirs in dallas of friday. i am really looking forward to it. i come from a great family. my parents are one of the few couples in the world today who are still married. i like other things too, just let me think for a second. i like birds. birds are the luckiest animal on earth. they get to fly around all day and laugh at people. my philosophy professor stated a quote from a book about utilitarianism. it said that no intelligent human, no matter how unhappy he or she is would rather be an animal with infinite animal pleasures. i would have to disagree with this statement because i think if given the chance i would be a bird. maybe i would even be a flying squirrel. i also like movies. i watch them all the time. i used to rent like six a night from the video store but i am really lazy. i sleep late and don't return them on time. i therefore incur late fees. i know what is going on though with this whole return them by noon bit. they know people like me won't wake up by twelve so they will rake in the late fees. they pawn this off as a bonus because you are getting twelve extra hours of movie watching time when in fact all you are getting is twenty or so dollars in late charges. i am aware of many scams. i don't really want to go into them right now because i am afraid of what the proponents of such scams will do to me if i reveal their secret. that last line wasn't true. i made it up. this is a trait i picked up from my friend who moved to texas tech. we would all sit around talking and making up elaborate, obviously fake stories just to make each other laugh. so in the memory of my old friend i hope that made you laugh. my twenty minutes are now up so i hope you enjoyed my train of thought. i'm not sure if this is what i was supposed to do but i guess it doesn't matter since it is a completion grade. so i must say goodbye for now. peace.

" well, my first psychology writing assignment, actually my frist real psychology assignment ever, in college. so technically this is my first assignment in the major of my choice. stream-of-conciousness. like weird faulkner stream-of-conciousness. that was weird. hopefully my thoughts arent as weird as that character, well i can't even think of the book or the characters at the moment. so it didnt make that much of an impression upon me. i really am mad that i can't use my own computer for this assignment. smoothies on keyboards don't make for easy using of all the keys. so here i am, in this girl across the hall from me's room, using her computer, trying to focus upon my thoughts and whatnot while people are playing loud music, opening boxes of poptarts, slapping me for writing about them in my first psychology assignment, etc. i can't work when its too loud. of course the main problem with this whole stream-of-conciousness assignment is that now i am think about what i am thinking about. take a minute on that one. am i really writing what i am thinking about or what i want you, whoever is reading it, to read. ok now to focus more. this is one of the weirdest assignments i've ever done. but i will confess, i've thought about writing a book in stream of conciousness style before. faulkner, joyce (he wrote that way didnt he?) and russell. it can't be too hard, but to be honest when your thinking about the things your smelling and feeling and seeing, its not just whatever on the paper. ) ahhh, the smell of poptarts wafting through the air. definately chocolate, maybe s'more. it smells so warm, and inviting and delicious. it even makes the delicious stir-fry in jester. i had stir fry today. the chicken was gross, the vegetables stale, almost a chore to chew it. so i did what all reasonable people would do, threw it away. despite all the starving children throughout the world, etc. money is going fast here. faster than i thought, its going to be a pain to call and ask the parents for some more cash. but its not like it will be the first time, or even the last. theres just some things in life that are expected, and one of them, is asking the 'rents for money. i hope my stream-of-conciousness writing is psuedo-interesting. i mean of course it won't be faulkner, but after all who is. would i want it to be too faulkner? i don't think so, i would probably become more of a study in psych than a student. i wish i wouldnt have known anything about faulkner before this assignment, because in the back of my head, i see his dashes, random . . things, and mine isnt looking like that. oh well. my hand is beginning to hurt a bit from typing non-stop. oh well, in the name of science! okay, people here are starting to talk to me while im trying to concentrate. talking about dust, and ac. and yes, of course when you use ac, dust increases. its a positive correleation. people are starting to laugh at me and call me faulkner. all in good fun, yes i know. i'll show them. haha. i want this girl to play howie day, and she wont. stubborn thing. music, its funny to think about, there are so many kinds. wow. i know about. 100000 songs. i think its safe to assume that. whenever you assume, though, it makes an ass out of you and me. my old psych teacher used to spit those sayings at us during senior year. she was a little off her rocker. she worked at dorthea-dix, but i think she used to be a patient there. either way it was funny to watch her. mrs. cheek, the cheekster, shivers. wow. she was wild. coco the gorilla. that's all the lady would talk about. it was like coco was her damn gorilla or something. haha, wow. everything related to coco. funny old woman. and she would knit, all day, during class during lunch. she was odd. but who's to say whats normal? im starting to think of this one time, when my mom told me that 6% of the world was sane. first off, that means there are a heck of a lot of crazy people running around. but then you start to think, 6%, holy mackeral, which side am i on? and then you finally realize, you arent one of those 6% whose 'normal'. either way, its fine. i love psychology. its bad, like cool bad, not bad bad. i worked two summers ago with a research psychologist in the va'baylor labs at the medical center in houston. i saw all kinds of interesting things. brain-slicing and the likes. this doc that i worked with, dr. kunik, was a card. i went with him to rounds. mr. rogers. the man, about 86, called me michelle pfiffer, and claimed that birds and horses around his house told him to kill the jews, and his wife. the thing was, his wife was dead. either way, it was interesting. there were so many like that. it was wild. then, came the multiple personalities. not for me, but i learned about them in psych class and read 'sybil' and then i was off. i read 'when rabbit howls'- whoa. how interesting though! oh no, i only have 2 minutes left, i want to keep talking about multiples. anyway, then i read 'i never promised you a rose garden', that threw me off. she was a little weird. but hey, don't forget about that 6%, we all are. this wasnt so bad after all. i didnt really focus on things i was smelling or feeling, well kinda. just mainly what i was thinking, which was enough for me, and i mean after all, i'm no faulkner, thank god.

"right now i'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. how can i find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. well i guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. that sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. which is i am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. this gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. so far since school started i have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. i have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. i want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in new york. now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. i got a girl that i'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. is it possible that i can expect our relationship to work out? i know i want it to, i know i want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something i can manage. are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. it just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. then i start wondering about my best friend who went to arizona and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. i miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because i feel i don't act like my true self around new people. i am not trying to be fake with anyone, but i can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and i don't like that. i just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because i would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. even though i got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that i spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences.

"college presents a life that is quite different from home life! having to adjust the many changes is both challenging and fun! doing laundry is a task that i am almost positive that i will never become accustomed to! it is boring and time consuming! when i visit home i appreciate the clean clothes in my closet even more, since they are clean and i wasn't the one to clean them! however, the independence i now have is unexplainable. i realize that i am in control of my life now and the direction i will go! sure i had control of my life before college, but my parents were there to guide me and make sure i made the right decision. now it's all up to me to make the right choices. i have to be the one to say, ""i don't want to go out tonight. "" and when my friends persist, i can't use the excuse, my parents won't let me, which makes it even more difficult! i know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that i will cherish forever. i am excited about my next four years here and am quite sure that with my determination and hard work, i will succeed not only at the university of texas, but in life as well!

"i'm feeling a little stressed right now. i have two tests coming up in about a week and i'm kind of behind on my reading. there is so much stuff to take care of now that i am out on my own. it makes me miss my family; i'm feeling kind of homesick right now. when i woke up this morning i found myself crying. i'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me. it just happens to be my friend's brother so i'm worried about what i should do. i don't really have anyone to talk to about it and i just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me. but, i did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, i'm glad i had someone to talk to. i'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but i'm not sure because i think i need to stay and study. but, i think i'm going to go anyway because i need a break and i need to feel more involved. hopefully some people will go. i wonder what i should wear. i want to go shopping, i'm getting tired of always wearing the same things. it kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room. there are still boxes everywhere and i feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but i just don't feel like it. i keep hearing door open in the hall, i wonder if my room mate is back. it's kind of awkward with her here. i don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative. i still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night. oh well. i'm watching this movie on tv about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing. i mean i know i'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often. it makes me feel out of shape, i hope that i don't gain a lot of weight because i'm not working out as much. it felt so good to be back in class the other day. i love the modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free. i guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and i'm one of the most experienced in the class. that kind of makes me relax because i don't get as nervous as i do around all the good dancers in the other classes. i get so nervous at auditions. i don't know how in the world i'm going to get into those major's dance classes. then what am i going to do? my ra just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie. i feel kind of stupid going because i've already been and my friends aren't going. but, oh well, i guess that i will just go. i feel like i need to meet more people. the only people i've have hung out with while i have been here are rockport people. i thought i was going to get away from all that, but i don't know. i don't know what to write anymore. i'm thinking to hard about this and i know i shouldn't be. i should just type whatever it is that i am thinking. the time is almost up. it went by surprisingly fast and i kind of enjoyed doing it. it actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. it's weird how writing can do that; professor pennebaker did mention that in my class. i guess it really is true. i feel like i should have an ending to this. but, i guess not. i guess your thoughts never really end. it kind of makes me nervous when i can't think of what to write. what does that mean? it's kind of like when i blank out talking to people which i seem to do a lot. i'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. i wonder what the point of it is.

"i returned to austin monday night at about 12:30 a. m. thinking i would be able to simply crawl into bed. wrong. upon opening the door to my room i was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. her name was sally and the source of her angst was my best friend sean. they, as i am, are both from houston. they had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for ut. unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory the castilian. unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and i being friends with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. sally declares she is ""so totally over sean"" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to sean, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in austin. she has a lot of frustration with sean, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. sean's feelings toward sally are fickle and skeptical. sean addresses some interesting questions sally is unable to answer. such as, why all of a sudden do you want to be ""friends"", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto bryan as a friend. sally's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to discuss any of the many issues at large. in turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 20 seconds of each other an awkward one. am i to take a side? most definitely not!!! i refuse! yet how can i befriend both sally and sean without functioning as a mediator. this is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from high school to huge ut college life challenging. thank you.

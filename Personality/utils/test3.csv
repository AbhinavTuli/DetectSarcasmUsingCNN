" i am really tired right now. i don't know why i am so tired. i really shouldn't be this tired. but i am. the weather outside is really dark and moody to me. it makes me tired i think. i am kind of mad at my friend because she told me that she was going to come pick me up and take me out but she bailed out. that is no good she is often times doing that. i can't help but think of what is wrong with me when i have to write for a psychological purpose. i think about what is wrong with me a lot. i filled out the pretest thing a little while ago and it was interesting to see where the questions were going. there is where the bias coms in i guess-- knowing that you are thinking for someone that is going to evaluate this eventually. i want to go running (there is a track outside) but i don't have the will power to do it. dieting is a lot easier than having to run. i like my dorm room a lot. it is very cozy and nice. my roomate is an okay guy so far, we have only had 1 run in so far. but there will be more i think. a lot more. we are very diffrent on how we approach things. i am a die hard liberal and he is a film major that just doesn't want to really take a stance. i don't know why that is. i have always been a liberal but sometimes i can be considered fiscally conservatice but incredibly socially liberal. i mean i am under the impression that one should let people do what they want with their bodies if they have the mind ability and ultimately the autonomy. i am really bad at grammar. i really really am. i don't know what i am so bad because i want to be an english major-- but alas i just am really bad at it. i really like being able to type really fast. it makes me happy. very very happy. i worked at a law firm taking dictation for a period of time and it was somehow-- in a masochistic fashion- fun. i am really nervous right now. this is college. the big c. this is what i have been looking forward to for my past 18 years of life. and now i am here. i am a freshman and sometimes it can be intimidating. i am the kind of person that likes to always be right, and always the smartest at whatever i do; but i don't know if i can be that here. there are so many people. it gives me a really bad inferiority complex. like a really bad one. and most of all-- that is what i hate; not being in some way special. i feel guilty at times because i think that i am being egocentric. well, i know that i am egocentric. my entire world is based upon my own little perceptions and the like. i don't know why. i would change it if i could. but it ain't possible. i hate being stupid. that is my biggest fear, well i guess it is, of being stupid. i would hate to be stupid. it would be bad. my roomate is talking to me right now. and i have to do this right now. but i guess it messes up an authentic stream of consciousness. i am also a bad speller. i remember when i was younger that i misspelled spell, and my teacher thought that i did it on purpose. very, very embarissing. i might want to be a poet. but really i know that i am going to be a lawyer probaly. i guess i will like it. i am kind of superficial at times and i need money to be happy. i hear people say all the time that they could be just happy as can be without money. and i don't believe that. i am just shallow. a poet makes no money really. notoriety is also big with me in my ambition, but ultimately money is what i need. i guess that with money, everything to me seems possible. i don't know why that is. when i was younger my family always had a fair amount of money. i got a lot of things that i wanted. i guess i am the anomaly to the saying, those that grow up with money; spite it. and those that have no money; crave it that really isn't a. what is it called. crap. . now i can't remember what it is called. it is a literary term. i use it a lot. ummm. . . okay. . a terse statement filled with wit. ahhhh. . this is really going to bug me. hmmmm. it is called a. well it starts with an a. . wait. i have to look it up. aphorism!!!!. . thank the lord. it toom me forever. very happy that i remembered. time is almost up. the twenty minutes is slowly coming to a close. i guess i wrote a lot. it wasn't constant there at the end. i had to look that word up. it would have driven my crazy if i couldn't have remembred.

"entering a big campus with so many different people, how interesting. this will be kind of a new experience, meeting other students just as smart or even smarter. i can bring ideas to this school and to others as well as the school and students to me. hopefully, i do well, or excel beyond my potential where i can feel proud and to just prove my abilities to myself. things now are a little different, where i live, what i eat, who i meet. but it seems that everybody has to deal with the same things or hurdles in that everybody are fighting, scratching, or just competing to be the best or is everybody just content to making to college? due to their being content, the race for those competing will be easier for them, but are we in a rat race to achieve greatness? there are also other things in life other thatn to prove that one person is somehow better academically because of a test made by some professor and to the subjects covered by what the professor says, there's to find leisure time when not having to study. school can be easily sluffed off, but students are paying for classes in which makes a person certified to do a job in which that person studied. money don't grow on trees; people gots to earn it, to feel good about oneself. but it's also the little things that can a person feel good like just getting together with friends and talking, to eat something that's very tasteful, to just observe how folks interact with certain situations and how watching or observing these things can help me without me having to go through, but somethimes some things have to experienced by oneself to fully understand. things aren't what they always seem just by loooking. college has too much to offer, where everything arent' feasible to understand, and just let things be.

"well this weekend has been really different. i guess that's because it was the first"""" actual weekend that my friends and i actually went out and """"explored"""" austin. i know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't """"explored"""" austin, but i think it was better this way. the first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. it was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us. she had in a way """"made new"""" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in austin. what was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. i don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving austin (the party was in san antonio) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. i was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. i feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. i guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. people are responsible for making their own decisions here. no one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. these people are adults now and can think for themselves. i also know that another reason i didn't want to or even want to go home until i really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family, especially my mom. i know that i'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time i talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last thursday, i felt like i needed to cry. i don't know why i felt like that. i know that we're very close but i really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. i also have another worry on my mind. one of my guy friends had be accepted to the university of houston and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. my guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. and this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and i, nearly every day together. or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. to me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but i don't know if that would be normal because i haven't really been in a relationship like that. well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the university of north texas in denton). every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. and my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. and of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. well the university of houston started two days before we did and that monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to denton. and he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. what we don't understand is why he decided that. this is his first relationship and they already have given each other """"a promise ring"""" or a """"promise gift"""" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. what my friends and i don't understand is what is going on through his head. well my time is almost up. i have like ten seconds left so i guess that's it.

" i really do not feel homesick at the moment. today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home. in a way i do feel like i miss my mom and my dogs and dallas in general but i am having too much fun in austin. more and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually i just got sick. literally. i felt like i was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second. as soon as i started feeling that way, i realized the true comfort of home that i do miss a lot. today i ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and i really wanted my mom to be sitting there. i felt really independent which i liked, but i also felt lost. i had no support and i feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom. on another note, i am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing. i am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night. it seems crazy to me. hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds. i feel so terrible right now. i am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry. the doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode. my room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as i write this. and all of her online music is driving me up the wall. it is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper. i am about to start getting ready for bed also because i am super tired. i really don't want to go to my 8 30 class in the morning. do you know how early that is? i am not looking forward to it. i hope the class is fun. it is about fashion design which interests me but i heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects. i finally got water. i am so excited. i really like the way my room is decorated. it is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute. ow. it really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes. ouch. the doctor told me to inform her in case of that but i had not had a problem really. my forehead itches. i feel like i am complaining a lot as i am nonstop writing but i guess it has just been a really rough day. i really love ut though, i am having such a great time. it makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until i am on my deathbed. that will be funny. i bet this writing is really bad but i am just following the rules. this constant humming is really annoying me now. i have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming. oh well, i can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all. this is going ot be an awesome year. i can not wait till the time gets rolling. i really feel like brushing my teeth. i can still taste my frosted flakes. gross. i have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night. i always forget little but important things like that. i also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out. my skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes. it kind of weird like that. well my time is almost up. i feel like even though i am thinking about things, i can not really decifer what i am hearing inside my head. it is kind of weird. my room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student i am, i am trying to resist laughing. well, i am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night.

"i am supposed to write for twenty minutes while i track my thoughts. i am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. it is 3:30, and unfortunately i have to miss my calculus discussion class at 4:30 due to a chemistry review for a test i have on thursday, the 14th. apocolyptica, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group metallica, is actually playing on my computer while i write this. i am also ripping one of my compact discs via my computer so i can listen to it while not actually having the cd in the rom drive. sometimes i like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. it is absolutely incredible. in junior high school, i had no idea what the internet was, nevertheless how to use it. now, i sit at my computer and i will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. how does the information get to the desired location? i suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 1s using the binary number system. still, the entire concept is simply amazing. what is in store for technology in the future? hover cars? now there is a concept. i come from houston, which is not only the most polluted city in the united states but also has a mighty big traffic problem. i think i will switch my music to beethoven. there we go. anyway, with the help of cars that """"float"""" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. however, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. this would definitely cause some major problems. maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. the song has now switched to holst's mars. my friend cody has the score to this piece at his dorm at the university of houston because he is a music major. a bunch of my friends and i are going to see the dave matthews concert in houston in a couple of days. i have seen the dmb perform two previous times at the woodlands pavilion, and they were incredible. however, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. they will be coming out with a new album very soon, so i assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. well, twenty minutes has just expired, so i will sign off now.

"i am not exactly sure how this is supposed to work, but i will give it a try. i am wondering if i am thirsty because i see the aquafina bottle on my desk. i know i will jump to a random thought soon. i just have not figured out exactly what it is. i am thinking about going to my next class at 5:00 for the cal discussing, and i am wondering if there will be any good looking guys coming today. there are a few cute ones, but who knows why they won't say hello. i myself don't think that i am totally unattractive, and on occasion i have been known to look hot. now one of my friends would think that she was cuter and had a better body than me, but i do not think so. so anyhow that makes me think of how we went bowling the other day and that she did look like she had lost some weight because her pants looked good on her. she also has great hair, that never looks clumpy, how does she manage that? o just go to the store and buy any shampoo that i want but not her she buys the most expensive thing at the mall, we are so different, yet so alike. maybe i just like to put on the image that i don't care when i really do, while she cares and she admits it. right now i feel like turning on the tv so that i don't fall asleep while i am typing this assignment up. i always get sleepy around this time but i feel so guilty taking a nap because i have so much work that i should be doing. right now i hear rosie o'donnell in the background and they are talking about nyc and now i want to go hang out in new york with my friends and i also want to go each some chocolate chip cookies. i am the biggest chocoholic. but my dad has diabetes, so i have decided that i would start to be cautious about what i ate. right now i am trying to keep up with everything i am thinking but my fingers cannot move as fast as all my thoughts. i just saw a picture of a finger cut open, and quite frankly that is one of the most disgusting things i have ever seen. i am not really sure if i like my nail polish color, it is a cool color, but i am not entirely sure that it looks good on me. rosie just mentioned dogs which makes me think of my dog, cleopatra, who i miss very much. she is a black cocker spaniel with white patches on her stomach and, she has beautiful big brown eyes. she is one of the cutest things i have ever seen. she waits for my little brother to come home from school at the window next to our front door. oh yah i want to download dr. dre's new song, but for some reason i cannot remember the name of the song. and i can't get napster, because of this stupid ut network, so i have to use imesh, which is not as good as napster, because i can't just write in the name of a song. i have had quite a bit of computer trouble lately. but luckily it is all fixed and set up now, due to many nice people who have helped me set it up. i am really not computer savvy and my parents always get on my back about it, and i used to not pay attention but now i am thinking that i should, because there are so many cool things that computers can do, and i don't want to miss out. i also want to go shopping, but i don't have money, i want to be like i dream of jeanie or bewitched and just be able to blink in and out of outfits. i saw a campbell's soup commercial that said soup only has 100 calories. now i am watching a bit about a wonderful guy who is very loving toward his mother, which makes me think that i could make more of an effort to be better to my parents. ok my twenty minutes are up so i will stop typing.

" so, i'm like, i have no idea what to write in a stream of consciousness for 20 consecutive minutes. so, i guess, i'll just start off with a recap of the week. nothing. you've got these 15 minute classes (woo-hoo), then a whole day afterwards to blow. that goes on for a few more days, then. hey hey! a three day weekend. blah, like i really have much of a life to actually spend those 3 days having much fun. but, it was a break, nonetheless. the last break i'll ever see in my given lifetime. well, i headed home. that was the plan. head home, leech off the folks one last time for a while, then i'd get back to my studying . well, suffice to say, i'm back, and i guess you could genuinely call this studying . &lt;changing mp3&gt; same auld lang syne . what an awesome slow song. mellow. sad. right, so. i'm boring you. a computer. a simple man-made machine apt in dealing with 90% of my socializing. thank you aim. i've got stupid art history to read up for. thirty something pages i do believe. god, i hate being sick. just my brilliant luck, i get home, and the sniffles begin. then a drippy nose. then the stoppage. ugh, vicks is my new best friend. this song is making me sad. i got to sne3eze. *whew* violent. gosh, i hope i can succeed in college. off to a pretty bad start. me, uncertain of what major i'd stay in. writer's block sets in, here. the song's almost over. hehe, it's kind of funny to think about. ever since i got here, all i did was sit in front of this computer and downloaded away at my heart's content. i got movies, i got jap crap (the beloved japanese anime), and i got music. did you know my music collection is about 2 gigs right now? i've got another gig stored away on cd. hah, i'm such a loser. my self-defeatist attitude can't be good for me, but it helps me get a laugh. you know, it really pisses me off when people have no sense of humor. &lt;song change, brb&gt; another slow, mellow piece, by jim brickman. he's an awesome pianist. i like to play the piano alot. when *secretly* i do it to please people. wahaha. my (un-)superior piano skills gets all the chicks. don't i wish. it's not like i'm that good either. i had what, 9 years of classical training (which by the ways sounds pretty good on a transcript), but it's not like the teacher was all that great. grr, i really hated her. she made piano the mainstay of what i should be doing. she really didn't care if i intonated that i had some project due the next day. i had to sit through stupid hour-long lessions, only to come home all feeling defeated. god. it's not like i ever really practiced either :). i lied a bunch when filling out practice charts. it's like: oh, yeah. i really did play those 50 minutes every day. what total bs :). oh, am i supposed to curse? can i curse? i swear to myself everyday not to do it, but it's really starting to creep into my vocabulary. hah, i've been typing so long, and constant, i bet my roommate is wondering what on earth could this guy be typing for that long anyways? hehe, oh well, he's cool, not much to worry about. man, i was worried all weekend that strangers i didn't know would pervade through the room and take my stuff. i'm paranoid that way you know? some unfortunate event from the past always haunts me. stupid burglars. they stole my stuff. i've been scared since. that's a story i tell everyone. man, i have some major psychological problems. hope this class sheds some light. you know, ever since i took psych in senior year, i've had this very strong fascination towards this field. heck, if i stayed on this course, i could become a doctor! study interesting stuff, and get lots o money! but, i guess, i shouldn't let my ambitions get too far ahead of other pressing matters. sixteen minutes and 30 seconds past. this assignment goes by pretty quick. this is really fun. you know, sometimes i really do do this. sit down, and just talk and rant about nothing for an extended period of time. it's fun. it's enlightening. sometimes it's downright hilarious the things i write down. hmm, i wish i were funnier. my friend jonathan has the best wit you'll ever see. awesome with satire and sarcasm, he's the best guy to turn to for a laugh. hah, just thinking about our antics i crack a smile. oh boy! an im message. too bad i can't answer it. ok, well, i'll take a peek. hey, we're playing basketball at gregory. i'm still feeling sick. i wonder if it's wise or not. i could just walk on the track some. i really don't feel like running around, aggrivating my sore throat. ok, ten seconds left. make the most of it. hah, cya later. sweeeeet! i can still write after the 2o minutes. but i guess that they'll only grade the first part. ahh, this assignment has really brightened my day. fun as heck. well, i'm out. later.

"well,after i finally figured out how to get into all of this computer stuff,i'm going to calm down by writing. the first thing comes to my mind is i'm wondering whether i should go out tonight or not. i'm determined to finish all of my homework for this week and i'm sure that i'll finish everything by ten or ten thirty. but' my body really doesn't need for me to go out, but by ten or eleven o'clock i get really antsy. i'm proud of myself today because i took care of a lot of stuff that needed to do. i woke up at eleven, which is later than i wanted but i got moving right away. i went to top and bought all of my pictures and then i went to my art history class. after class, iwent with my two friends sara and whitney to university realtors to figure out our living situation at villas next year. it turned out that the apartment we wanted had already been taken after the guy said he would reserve it for us. so we got really mad at him and we worked it oit that we would move into the six bedroom apartment rather than the five bedroom apartment. therefore, we had to get two more roommates. so we went over to joanie's place and got erin vaughn and joanie to live with us. it actually turned out for the better because the six bedroom place is for 8 people but since he screwed us over, we get to have nine people. with nine people, the rent ends up being cheaper. since i'm sharing a room with my friend jennifer, it'll be cheaper for us. i'm really excited about the girls i'll be living with next year because they are all really cool. my roommates for next year at villas will be anne, carolyn, jennifer, paige, sara, whitney, joanie, and erin. i also had ed on my mind today. he's my new boyfriend and i'm just crazy about him. everybody says how great it is for me because he is such a nice guy and a gentlman. we just met about two and a half weeks ago and we were crazy about each other right away. everyone is so surprised that i didn't know him before because we are so close already. everyone asks how we met: he is my good guy friend's roommate. my guy friend is will and right when will moved into towers, he wanted me to come over and see his place. so i went over there and i distinctly remembering ed answer the door and i had met him for the first time. i thought he was so cute and we just talked for alittle while and our personalities seemed to click. later that night, ed called and invited me to the football game. then we just started talking more and more and we just fell for each other. i've already screwed up a little bit in our relationship and i was terified that he would leave me. but, he forgave me and took me back right away and i'm so incredibly thankful. i never want to feel that bad again in my life. that's when i knew that i really was head over heels for him when i was terribly depressed over such a small mistake. i hope it works out for the future and all of my friends just tell me to grasp on to the now with your boyfriend and not to look ahead or else it could end up causing problems. i'm just so anxious about everything because this is my first real boyfriend ever. well, my twenty minutes is up. bye.

"well let's see, today was an okay day. psy class was pretty interesting. mr pennebaker is a funny guy. too bad i have a feeling that class will be hard. i hope i do good. i really want to make all a's this semester and my whole time here at ut. i'm listening to this new song i really like. i listen to it a lot. its by nasty boy clique and the song is called i want to love you. it is not a dirty song. it's really nice. the first time i heard it, it made me think of this guy i like. it's kinda our story. i like this boy a lot. and he does too. i miss him. this feels weird writing what i'm feeling to someone i don't even know. but anyhow he is 100 miles away from me. he goes to school in waco at tstc. i really hope he does well, and i know he is. as i look at the time its only been 3 minutes plus some. man this sure is going pretty slow. hmm. what else. oh yeah i need to read fast food nation for english class. i hate reading. i was wondering how i would do in college since i don't like to read. i'm doing okay so far, but i don't know. i have to take a quiz in that class tomorrow. i'm lost for words now. my own little writer's block. and a whole 15 minutes left. well no one is in my dorm right now. the 3 other girls are gone. this one girl she sleeps really early like 11. or at least that's early for me. but the bad part isn't sleeping early but she snores, and its very loud. gosh we all hear it. jessica just came in the door, and scared me cause i thought it was her. but anyways, i'm bored. i really don't want to do this for 20 minutes but i need to cause i want the grade. what else? oh i ate popcorn. it was nice. it was cheddar. there was an extra bag of cheese to add. yummy in the tummy! :) on my little desk i brought a phone right, and it doesn't work. the phone jack is whack. shikisha's phone jack doesn't work either. only jessica's. lucky her. now i'm looking around my dorm to see what else i could write about. i see the picture of me and brian. that's the guy i like. darn i wish he was here. he will call me when he is out of class. *smiles* hahahaha as i write this i was just thinking that the people who read this and analyze this get that females usually write about relationships, boys, and all that mama drama. mannnnn. i wonder if boys do that too? hahaha. crap i need to to barnes and noble and buy magazines for english. what a waste. all i need are some ads, along with that i have to deposit a check so i can have some money in my bank account. my friend danny keeps iming me, and his mean self warned me. i will warn him back when i'm done with this. and just now my sister imed me asking who warned me on aim. i think i should do something today, but i'm not sure. that party at the plaza thing is still going on. but all the organization people are gone. they had some basketball scholarship thing, putt putt golf, and other random things, but i didn't do any of it. i just passed by. my left back hand has *due writing assignment online. and the online is underlined. hehe that was my reminder to do it. i did it after i watched supermarket sweep. cause there wasn't anything else to watch. and i did this cause i had nothing else to do. i wonder if my buddies want to go and do something? gosh darnit i also need to go to that jester thing where they help you with homework. i need some help in math. i guess i just don't understand. woooo hoooo. like 2 more minutes to go and i'm done. in this counting minutes'seconds i will just say. holla [term used in houston. hahaha] a lil ghetto, since austin isn't.

"hi my name is brandi and i am writing this assignment, mainly cuz you told me too. right now i am really tired and worried about my grandfather who happens to be in the hospital right now. i feel stupid writing about absolutely nothing just what i think about and since that is what i was thinking that is what i typed. i am really wondering when this line is going to end cuz it is pretty darn long. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing at the university of atm right now. i wonder if he misses me or forgot about me. though i know that he didn't forget about me. i mean who would i am an unforgettable person. this apartment'dorm is so terribly hot. i haven't figured out how to work the air conditioner yet. i believe that it is broke, my room mate can't figure it out either. let's see i have wrote for about 5 whole minutes so far, and this is a lot harder than it sounds. let's see what can i do this weekend. hummmm. there is the football game, a party i was invited too, go home (which i don't see happening), go see my grandfather (which i am not real sure about doing), or study. i believe i will take options one, two, and four. i don't want to see my grandfather because i hate to be around sad situations. they depress me and i hate to feel sad or depressed. i figure i can make myself that way why put myself into that situation. i love my grandfather but i don't want to go there. there is also the fact that if i don't acknowledge it then it might not be true. that is the way i think. if i don't see it then it doesn't happen. illogical but it works for me. my friend just came over and i let her in she is now washing my dishes, she is one of my best friends and i have known her since kindergarten, but boy can we get on each others nerves. not kidding because we really do. we have gotten to be like sisters almost especially this past summer and we just were around each other too much. and when we argue it is usually over irrelevant things, or really really stupid things. we also argue over the race issue. she is black and i am white, that is one issue that can really tick me off. i don't understand how people can be so stupid and childish. why should we look at race instead of the people. that issue really makes me mad. i really have completely nothing to say at all. i did receive a letter well email from my boyfriend today and it really made me happy. he told me that he missed me. it had been awhile since i have seen him but hopefully he will be able to come see me this weekend on sunday since there is a stupid football game on saturday. i really miss him and wish he was coming here but it makes me happy when i hear from him and see him. i guess since i am a female one of the most lovable things i like to do is hug someone, but only at certain times. cuz when i am sad, it will make me cry in a heartbeat. kind of what happened yesterday. i told my room mate about my granddad and she gave me a hug and i wanted to just cry, but i hate to do that in front of people. lord have mercy it is hot. i am about to catch on flames i am soooooo hot. well i have typed for twenty minutes so i am leaving now. i sure am glad cause it is really hard to just wait until your mind has something to say. i mean when you aren't thinking about it you can think all day long but when you are trying to think of something to say you cant do it. never fails. happens to me every time.

"hi, i have no idea what i'm going to write but who cares, here goes. i'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of jester west, across the where i now reside, in jester east, doing a writing assignment for psychology on what comes in to my mind first. well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. i've been away from books and studying for 2 3'4 years now, and 1 week into ut and 5 classes and 16credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that i have to do right now. i've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. and the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! damn, now i know why americans are so rich. nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now i guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after i complete this assignment, and maybe the next. thoughts, ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. well i'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, i thihnk, i did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??jerk! now, let's get on to sensations. hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. a result of chatting last night with my roommate till 1am and waking u p this morning at 7. damn, really hate early mornings, i'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. but what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 20 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata!

"i am in my dorm lost in my own thoughts. my roommate went to houston so i am left here to do homework and what ever else i decide to do to take up time. the tv is blaring, however, i hardly ever watch it. the people next door are playing their music and i hear some bustling in the hallway. the air conditioning is making this high pitched squeaking noise. somebody just got off the elevator. my stomach is growling, i have been up for several hours and haven't eaten. i love my computer. i feel sorry for people who do not have a computer in their room. almost all of the classes ise the internet so it has to be difficult to do much work. i have a really short attention span. that is why i can't watch tv every thing i see reminds me of something else and i start to not watch the tv. i like it here(ut). i thought that i wouldn't like such a big school because my high school was so small, however, i found that i do like it. it is good to have a change. some people think that change is not good but i think even the best things need a change every now and then. i have to use the restroom. the light in our bathroom flickers every time you turn it on. it doesn't bother me i'm just glad that my roommate and i have a bathroom to ourselves. i don't know if i would have been able to deal with someone who does not keep their bathroom clean. dishes in the sink are kind of like that for me too. if there are any in the sink i always do them. i guess you could say that it's a pet peve. burger king ad is on the tv that sounds good. this computer light is giving me a headache. for the past couple of years my eyes have been giving me a headache. certain lights hurt my eyes. it is a miracle if i go a day without my head hurting. i like to drive standard cars. i really makes me angry when people buy a sports car that is automatic. it would be so much more fun if it was manual. i am the worlds worst speller. and i think i have dyslexia. i confuse my left and right especially when i'm driving. it's not that i don't know the difference i know which way to go i just say the wrong one. really i'm just a hypochondriac. my best friend came to visit me this weekend. i had a blast. now i have to go visit her. she lives in jacksonville, texas. never heard of it, well no one has it's just below tyler. basketball is now on tv. i don't know who is playing. my cell phone just rang. too bad they are just going to have to wait i'm in the middle of something. i wonder who it was. oh no my twenty minuets is up. it was nice talking to you. bye.

" well college is something i was definetly not prepared for. in high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the university of texas, i go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. so far in the during these 2-3 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. which leaves me to consider that perhaps i should buy one of those rolling back packs. the readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting. i really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. always relying on fast food is disgusting. a person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. i have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. the peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. all they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them. my classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. i believe i can do though. i have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. i wake- up at 6:30 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. she, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 7:20 am i am off to ut. once i arrive on campus the time is 8 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. our first class doesn't begin until 10 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. by the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 5pm and i get home at 6 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. but i realize i must read a chapter for rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 12am, and once again i only get about 6 hours of sleep. this system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. i see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. i don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. this makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.

"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like s&m. i came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers i have had correspondence with since i recorded my cd. the fraternity parties weren't that great except for a kappa sigma one that was pretty wild. i pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. i am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in bfe. i can't say it's all been bad though i did get a free t-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. i don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then i can continue to ramble. college is supposed to be the best years some say. i think i should of keep better stock in my highschool years. now except for parties i live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language i don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. i'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. so i'll let you off till i have to write the next one.

" the kitchen is so sterile and cold. i must say that this is a bit intimidating; writing your thoughts down on an electronic module for someone else to analyze and decide who you are. my mom keeps looking over at me. i can tell she wants to talk to me but i am avoiding her glare without trying to seem rude. it's really making me sad that i have to move back home from living on my own. i hate not having a space that is mine and i always feel like i am hurting someone's feelings with my disinterest in their daily lives. my dad calls like 5 times a day it seems whenever i am home and that creeps me out. i hope i don't end up like that. very clingy. my feet hurt. i wish i could go change shirts because the kitchen is so cold and this tank top is not doing it for me but i am filling out this what-ever-you-call-it. i wonder what people make of me in general. im sure their impression of me on paper is a bit different that in person. that makes me sad. i think i come off as more uptight than i actually am although i still seem like a hippy no matter how hard i try to suppress my bohemian leanings. my hair is so short i can feel the cold air on the back of my neck. it is so like my dad to keep the tempature of the house so friggin' cold during august that i want to dethaw in the heat. susannah seems to have gotten along fine without me this last week and a half now that she has moved into the co-op. it hurts my feelings that she only cares about me when she has no other better option. i am her best friend though but still, i hate feeling like the backup. i am not the backup for ian, however. he is so sweet. i can't believe he decided to drive all the way down from colorado to come visit me. i miss him so bad and it hasnt even been a month yet. i feel like a hormonal boy, this is how much i miss him. kissing is never the main part of our relationship definately but my body seems to be confused as to where he has gone. where has he gone? i really don't see the good reason for him moving off to colorado though and not even immediately starting college there. i know that whole band thing but i really think it has a lot to do with his family. between those two huge families, god, that boy doesnt stand a chance as far as an independant existance. his mom, kathy, is so fucked up though. i can't believe she left jay for that abusive asshole. i hate that guy so much; such an ass. i am tired and i will be pissed off if shyla doesnt call me back soon. she is leaving for dallas tomorrow and has put off seeing me for two long of a period. she is no longer my best friend and i am no longer hers but she, for some reason, cannot accept this and instead always makes it out like i am rejecting her or something when this is not the case at all. if anything it is the other way. she totally ditched me this summer and then has the audacity to claim i am pushing her away. ouch. good thing we really arent close anymore or else i would want to cry. i can't wait to see ian. saturday night or sunday morning? i wonder when he will come in. it would be so cool to have him come into the cafe while i am working and surprise me. well, i guess it wouldnt be a surprise if i secretly expect' hope for it. i was so nervous today in italian. god, can i type fast. my hands just can't seem to keep up with my thoughts. much like my short legs can't keep up with my stride and thus, i walk in fast short steps, very embarrassed. ian's long legs are a hoot next to mine. i think he is a whole foot taller than me. we also weigh the same. talk about weird. he is skinny and i am vuluptuous . i hate that clint thought that feminists were all whiney bitches. that's just like saying all christians are homophobes. simply not true. damn, the phone just rang and it was my mom. she calls me even on her errrands just to tell me that shyla called. how more nosey, clingy and in general annoying can you get? i am tired of mom and dad always calling every second they are away. those are two people who do not need cell phones. my fingers are cold. sometimes i wonder if i have bad nerves or something because my fingers and toes are always cold it seems. i am so nervous about my italian one class. all that pronounciation in front of strangers and an intimidating teacher. it freaks me out to an extent that i can hardly even mutter prego. i am such a shy socially inept dork but i love it all the same. okay, i was just imformed that the 20 minutes are up. goodbye. for now. until you enter my thoughts again.

"here i sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard. writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard. maybe because i feel partially tired and torn down from my long day. i am looking forward to tomorrow because thursdays are probably my easiest days because i will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend! although i have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am, which was time i had to arrive at school during my high school days. since high school just popped into my mind, i have to say that college is a major leap from high school. despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful. for instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind. not to mention your adolescence. i am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come. one of my """"bumps"""" that i am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point i enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice. another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that i am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices. i find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because i can make my future what i want it to be.

"today is the friday before labor day. my boyfriend is picking me up and we are going to drive back to houston. i am excited about going home. my suite mate is also going home this weekend. that is fun. her parents don't want her to come back so soon. in one way i don't really want to go home either. i am going because i will get to spend time with my boyfriend. his name is jonathan-by the way. my room mate is sleeping. i kinda feel bad about typing while she is sleeping, but i have things i need to get done. one of those things involves typing. she has been really mood lately as far as people being quite. she needs to understand that living with three people is hard. i have flower from bambi on my desk. i got her from my boyfriend. i collected all of the mcdonald's toys. i had all the characters from bambi except flower. i don't remember why i mentioned that to him, but he went to an antique store and found flower! it was really sweet. he gave it to me when i was sick. we have a really good relationship. it is really hard being away from him. we have only been dating for three months, but we have spent every hour of every day of those three months together. there was only one day we spent apart. he went to his dad's house. he went there early in the morning. i was really tired that day. i don't remember what i did but i was tired after. it was a long day with out him. i think my friends started to feel neglected because i was spending so much time with jonathan. most of them understood. i did make time for them-but just not as much time as i was spending with them before jonathan and i were together. my friend jessica and i got into a big fight because i was spending so much time with jonathan. that was part of the problem. the other part of it was that she stopped taking her prozac. bad move. she really upset me. we going in a fight at 3rd period and i was crying at 4th. i went to talk to a friend of both mine and jessica's about the situation. jessica showed up and started yelling at me even more. i was none too happy. lauren told me that jess was under alot of stress because of family problems and other things. i didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me. jonathan was my first real boyfriend. jess has gone through many. i am always happy and supportive of them and her relationships. for once i wish she could do the same for me. it has all worked out now and jessica and i have talked. we are friends again. that is good. i hate it when people are mad at me. i do not do well with enemies. my mommy always taught me to never make enemies. i still call my mom mommy. i don't know why. it is just one of those things. one of shoshana's friends would tease me about that. that's ok. i'm well over that! i have my next class at 2-3. i don't know what i will do until then. i think i might do some of my work-but that is not likely. i think i will return some e-mail and stare at the walls. i'm good at that! it's my hobby, next to sleeping! until next time i have to type-i think i will go now!

" i am very, very tired. i have not been getting enough sleep, i wake up too early for my eight o clock math classes, and i can never seem to go to bed earlier than 2 in the morning. i want to go to bed earlier, but for some reason i just can not. maybe part of the problem is that i am addicted to diet dr. pepper, and i even drink them late at night. it is probally the caffeine that is keeping me up. i am also feeling extremely stressed out at the moment. i went through rush and became a pledge in a sorority that i love. i went through the whole process by my self. unlike many other girls, my parents did not really help me, or even want me to. now that i have become a member, we are accpted to pay a lot of money and my parents are telling me we do not have it. it is extremely frusterating because they are being complety unsupportive. i told them that i would get a job and they said that if my grades suffered then i would have to quit the sorority and the job, but since they are not offering to pay much money towards it, what exactly is it that they want me to do?? i am also extremely frusterated that i do not have a computer yet. i am in the college of education, and i ordered an ibook from the ut computer store. when i placed the order, they told me it would take up to two weeks for the computer to be in. it has been a week and a half so far. i called the store today and the lady was extremely rude and said that it usually takes three weeks for a customer to receive their product. i am using my roomate's computer at the moment, and although she says that she does not mind, i feel bad constantly using it, and i would just be more comfortable if i had my own. i also feel sick. i have had a sore and extremely scratchy throat for what feels like weeks now. i never seem to get better. one day i might feel a little more lively and energetic but the next day i will just feel worse. you know, i am usually not this pessimistic. in fact i am proud of the fact that i am so optimistic, however at this moment, right now, i just have a lot of problems and a lot of stuff to be upset about. the whole cost of my sorority is really stressing me out. i know that my parents want me to quit, they were hinting at it on the phone last night, but i just do not want to. it is something that i have gone through, and it is something that i enjoy. i am the first person on either side of my family to have joined either a sorority or a fraternity, and i would like to uphold this. i would like to prove to them that their is nothing wrong with it. my family can sometimes be close minded and i would like to be the first one to open up their mind on this idea. lets see, so i don't sound like a depressed, basket case, let me think of the positive aspects in my life right now. to begin, i absolutely and completely am in love with college. i love my dorm, i like my roomates and my suitemates and all of the people that live in my hall. i have already established some awesome friendships and i know that as the year progresses, they will only blossom. i like my classes. i mean school is school, but the classes i am taking are somewhat interesting to me, and i do not really mind studying these subjects. i am in the college of education; i want to be an elementary school teacher, and i am very much looking foward to that. i can not wait to begin working with children. i love kids. i would like to have four someday. preferabally two girls and two boys, but it is not like i would not be happy with whatever i get. i am from austin, and my parents and my two younger sisters live about fifteen minutes away. i have not seem my family all that much since i have moved in because i am trying to get the full college experience of going away. i almost decided against ut because i thought it was to close to home, but now i am so glad that i came here. however, the point of this was, i am not homesick because i have lived in austin for the last 5 years. it is cool though because i never spent much time down on campus, so it is almost like i am in a new city. the guy that lives down the hall laughs at me because i am so bad with directions and do now know where the closest wal-mart of heb are from our dorm. but i always tell him that it is because i am not from this part, i mean i just do not know this whole downtown'campus area of austin very well. i am very excited because today i am beginning my diet and new excerise plan. following a diet and watching myself lose weight always makes me feel better about my self. these are just some of my thoughts and feelings at this moment.

" i am really hungry right now. i think i'll go eat lunch in about twenty minutes or so since that's how long i have to sit here. i hope my classes this year won't be so hard. i want to be somewhere tropical maybe cozumel or aruba. the weather here is ok but it's so hot. like the other day i think i was going to pass out because i had to walk like 2 miles across campus and then i found out i was in the wrong building. some of the people who work here are real jerks. the girl at the library was no help and she was rude to top it off. she told me to go to the help desk when i asked her how i got an if account. i dont' miss that many people in baytown. i do miss my parents and my dog frida. i wonder how tommorow will go since it's sept. 11. i hope no one pulls any stupid pranks or anything like that. i really wish i could be with my family but thats no possible since they live 3 hours away and i have classes. my cousins are so cute. i am looking at t picture of them right now. lauren is a so elegant looking and suzanne's the quirky one. i feel bad for nicole becau se she is losing her job. dynegy was bound to go under once engron did. i never kep up with that guy kenneth lay, the ceo for engron, or i think thats what he was. i miss seeing my dad and visiting him at his work. i wonder if i am depressed. sometimes it's hard for me to sleep at night, but who knows. i have one, two three four, five six pictures in frrames in my room. my roommate just left for class. she is cool, but we have some conflicting religious beliefs. being a mormon must be hard. i know the are ostracized alot. i justdon't get the spirit child thing about how we were spirit children in heaven with god before we were born. . or the part i read somewhere about how you have to wear holy underwear and things of that nature. to me,that's just crazy,but i have to respect other people's religions and beliefs because that's what i expect from them in return. i am so hungry. i want to go eat. i wonder if i have gained any weight since i've been here. when i played soccer in highschool i was so much more muscular and toned. now i have to find time to work out. where is sarah? i think is in her room or doing laundry. her room mate is so nice, but i feel bad for her because of that nick guy she dated who just broke up with her. she is too nice. she's to pretty for him anyways. some of the food inthe cafeteria scares me. i always hear horror stories about people eating food and finding things in what they are eating. ughhhh. now i'm not going to be hungry anymore. i don't have anything in here to eat except for fruit. i am sick of getting up at 8 in the morning to go to spanish. my professor is ok, but he can be too sarcastic at times and i just want to yell. yeah. so i am debating on whether i should do the diamond dolls. jenny is in it and she said it was fun. chris would get mad though. i don't know. he may play baseball here next year, or thats what i think now. but i hope he does. my cold is annoying. what time does the mean lady at the front desk work? she is gripey. jessica and her boyfriend fight alot. kalie shouldn't tell them what to do but ithink she just feels authoritative because that's how her stepdad seemed when i met him. where am i going to eat tonight? is uncle phil back in town. that birthday card kara sent me was really sweet. i'm glad we have become closer than we used to be. i used to think we would never be close because we don't have that many of the same interests. she has lost weight. i wish i could lose 10 lbs. i am going to work out at 3. then i will be back here at 4. take a shower, call aunt beth and see when we are going to eat tonight. mimi and poppa are coming. that's good since i never see them . how far is granger from here? there is a really loud annoying girl who lives in my hall. she talks about crude things. i wonder if you can tell how smart i am by reading what i'm writing. i hope i don't sound like a fool. who reads these things anyways. i like listening to enrique. where is he? when is lunch over? gosh i need to stop thinkng about food. that's not good. i don't want to be fat when i get olded. how many students does ut's law school take every year. i wonder if i could get in. i need to send those checks off so they don't expire. i am so wasteful sometimes. i need to get a book rack so my books and folders aren't thrown all over the floor. how fast does the fastest typer in the world type? i think i type like 60 words a minute. maybe i'm off. that was like years ago in bcis. tomorrow better be safe for everyone. i am cold. the ac is on high. . yeas ",1
"i live in amarillo and i can't exactly drive home to see them. i envy the people in my dorm who only live a few hours away from home. they can visit their friends and family on every weekend or weekday for that matter. i feel a little guilty because i miss my friends more than i miss my family. maybe that is because i had a better relationship with my friends than i did with my family. this is probably because i spent a lot more time with my friends during the past few years. it seemed i felt empty if i didn't see my friends for a day, but i could go weeks without seeing my family and i'd feel just fine. don't get me wrong, i love my family, and i do feel slightly homesick, but i have a stronger relationship withe my friends. whenever i spent """"quality time"""" with my folks, all we would do would sit on the couch in the living room and watch seinfeld; we would never talk, but it really wasn't their fault. whenever i would feel like talking about something important that was on my mind, they wouldn't have a problem with it, but i would feel awkward. it has always been that way, so it's not some kind of """"teenager"""" thing that just kind of happened during my rebellious years. my parents are the greatest, and so are my three brothers. i have one older brother that is about to turn 20, so the age difference is pretty narrow. we used to do things all the time when we were younger, but now we hardly talk at all. i also have two younger brothers, 8 and 14 who are also great, but they're not so easy to talk to. my brother, kyle, who is 14, has a lot of problems i think. he doesn't have any friends and he always just stays home and watches tv and plays video games. when i ask him how his day was, he just says fine, and thats all the conversation really consists of. i couldn't really talk to him because i felt so sorry for him. i also worry about my mom because she loses sleep trying to find ways to help him. my youngest brother, on the other hand, has plenty of energy and self-confidence and a lot of friends. i think he'll be one of the """"popular guys"""" in school, and i feel bad when my little 8 year old brother can outdo my 14 year old brother kyle. i also try to think up ways to raise kyle's self confidence, but i'm really not much of a help. i find myself making fun of him unconciosly just like many big brothers all do, but i really feel bad about it. i sometimes know how he feels because in junior high i didn't always have five or ten friends to hang out and talk with, and i sometimes found myself at home on the weekends feeling like a loser, but i eventually found my place and my friends in high school, and i hope that's what he does when he goes to high school next year. he is old for his grade because he was held back in the first grade, and he has some kind of a learning problem and when i try to help hime with his school work he gets embarrassed and won't let me. i just really hopes he finds his place in high school or if not, in college, like many people do. so, maybe i should spend more time with my family when i get home in a few monthes instead of with my friends ",0
" well for some reason i am stressing out about everything that is going on in the first few weeks of school! not only are classes overwhelming and so much different than high school because of number of students in each class, but i am in a whole new city! for the first time i am away from my family trying to make my own choices, doing my own laundry, making my own food, and trying to make new friends. i am scared about being able to study too! and i am scared about failing. i also just went through rush and i am in a sorority which is also very overwhelming. we just had a meeting and we have to keep a certain gpa, finish many hours of volunteer work and stay at the house for at least 10 hours a week to study there. we also have mixers twice a week at night. i don't know how i ma going to manage all of these things at once. i am also stressing about finding where to live next year. i had a deposit down for an apartment with a girl i met during the summer, but the more i got to know her, the more i knew i couldnt live with her. so now i am trying to find a group of nice girls and find a place to live before they are all taken. not to mention my ex boyfriend is here and things between us are very complicated. i wish he could communicate with me and tell me how he really feels because i am tired of playing all these stupid games! we keep trying to make each other jealous, but i really care about him alot. ohhh and i am getting sooooooo fat! i swear our older sorority sisters want to keep giving us cookies, cake, and candy to make us fatter! i don't have time to excercise. but i really love it here and i know i am going to have so much fun! i have already met several awesome girls that are so fun to hang out with. and since i came from a small baptist schoool its interesting to meet so many different kinds of people. i love how ut is so diverse. i love my roommate too. i went pot luck and was kind of nervous about that but we are perfectly matched. we are both neat freaks and have the same personality. i hope we become great friends, so far we have talked about everything. she is really smart too. i miss my best friends from high school. two of them went to baylor, i was baout to go there with them but i loved ut. it was a hard choice to make though. the only person i really knew here were a few older girls that went to my high school and my ex boyfriend. . who is frustrating me! i couldnt sleep at all last night because i was upset with him! i miss my mom and my family too. even my dog. i don't know when i will go home. . it seems like there is so much to do here. ohh i really want to see the movie swim fan and sweet home alabama. i bet i won't have time to see movies here and i don't have the money either! my money is all gone! i have no clue where it went, i never get to go shopping here. i also need to find a church to go to, just to keep me grounded. its kind of hard to focus here. but i am really happy about the sorority i am in. it was such an emotionally draining process, so many girls where heartbroken. but i just hope that there isnt a stereotype against sororities because each girl i have met has been truly kind and helpful and its such a great way to meet people and do stuff for the community too. i am going to the childrens hospital tommorrow morning to visit the children there. i am really excited about that. i love kids. i think i want to be a teacher, i just hope i have the patience for it and that i make it through college! its so weird to think i am in college right now trying to get a degree! i still feel like a little kid sometimes. hopefully i will be able to focus and get settled down and figue out my priorities!

" i really want to lose weight, i want rob to look at me and want me. i wonder if he does? he says he does, but i wonder if he really does because when i want to be with him, he acts like hes got to do homework, or actually im not really that i don't know. he doesnt put me first i guess. id skip out on my homework to be with him. but i guess since hes a freshman, he doesnt know any better. however i am a junior, so he has to want me. this is a hard assignment because right now my mind is not wondering off of rob. i think about him quite often. hehe. . i wonder if he knows that. his hair. i love his hair. . his body, damn. junior boys do not have bodies like his. . whoa. . i have to take of my bracelets they are annoying me. i can't wait til im 21. i wish i could be laying out right now, but the pool is closed on mondays. i really want my hair to grow out. i have been growing it out for hmm. . . lets see. . years? no matter damnt. i have been trying to get it to get longer for so long, and it doesnt seem to be happening. its not like i cut it to my shoulders and then am like, okay, now im going to grow it out. its been this length for a while now. i need to relax. i have all this tensions in my arms and hands and its annoying me. i wonder if its cause im typing or if its just because im like that. i wish i had a dog here at school. i want a pet so bad, but not all the times. i wish i could have a pet when i want one, and then when i don't want to clean up the shit, it just disappears. i wonder if something else will happen soon with the terrorists. i wonder if the whole a-bomb thing is going to happen with sadam h. damnit, i guess im ready to die, but not really. i am just now getting into the swing of things of life. i am happy living alone, and i just want to do well in school. before all i cared about was my social life, but i suppose its obvious i don't care anymore about that because i have a thing for a freshman. i hate boys but i love them. i know i can get whomever i want for the most part, but everytime i let myself be all how i would like to be, i lose them. i wonder if i have done something wrong with the boy. i bet hes wondering if im crazy because im a junior. he always asks why im with him, or why i would even talk to him or hangout or whatever. but that was before. now its been a month and perhaps hes not interested anymore. oh why in the hell do i care? there are so many guys out there. i am so boy crazy. i wonder if i am normal. maybe its because im a scorpio. i didnt believe in all that shinnanigans before, but i recently read something that said scorpios are more horny or more into relationships or the opposite sex or something. that is very true in my case. what you going to dooo. i go crazy on you. i go craaazzyy on youuu. . i love music. i wish i could write better poems so i could write songs. oh man now i have to pee. . i wonder what i did that turned him off. we used to be best friends. . i wonder if he thinks of me. probably, obviously not as much as i think about him otherwise he wouldnt have let things go to shit like he did. i hate mis. i hate homework. i wish they could just plug into your brain something, like a computer, like a little chip, so that learning or anything would be effortless because the chip would offer all the knowledge we need on a certain subject. like if you wanted to be a doctor, you just get a surgeon chip installed, etc. i want to be an actress. it better happen. i wish my parents could be happy. they don't seem very happy. i love to laugh. i don't wnat to get old. self control, self control. i wonder what is going to happen to me. what constitutes a slut? i know im not, i just kiss lots of boys, youre a slut if you sleep with all of them, and i don't do that. . . i hope i don't do that when im older. cause once you get started, its hard to stop. i wonder if shes doing coke? id hate to be her. shes so insecure and so untrusting, i don't trust anyone, but she really doenst trust anyone. id hate to be bipolar. gosh, i feel so bad, but i wish i could shake her and be like, snap out of it!!! quit it! stop! im getting hungry and i told myself i need to eat less, however, damnit, i would love to have some jalepano cheese rightnowww. . . yuummm. . i can't believe shes gettting married because shes pregnant. that sux. i would never do that. . well i can't say never because i have said id never do a lot of things that i do. i hate that. it makes me think i have no control overmyself whatsoever. i need to order some more zit medicine. 33, 34. . . i want to make a lot of money.

" well here i am, just sitting and typing. i've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - i've got class til 7, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week! hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me? thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 8 (or 9?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 05 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big l-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that maggie (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong! maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that i've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 1) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 2) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 2 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 1) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 2 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she has her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows! im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never ",0
"i just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. it makes me feel like maybe i made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. i didn't really have a good reason, other than i knew i wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. everyone asks why i came here. i'm sick of explaining it. i wish there were more out of state students here. i was really homesick the other day i just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. i couldn't sleep at all. hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. i just felt terrible. it was the first time i'd ever been that homesick. however, i've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time. i wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. it's only been like 5 minutes so far. i wish i typed slower. we had to do some kind of journal similar to this in my freshman english class. we would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. back then i thought what a waste of time, but now i wish all our assignments were like this. it's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or i am using works correctly. i'm not in my room right now. i'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. it smells really good. now i'm hungry. i tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. i don't know, i just get so discouraged because i have a really short attention span especially when not reading """"reader friendly material"""" i just can't concentrate on it. i've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while i'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. it just doesn't seem to work. don't get me wrong, i think this will be my favorite class this year, it is just hard to digest. i'm glad i didn't take psychology in high school. supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. instead, i took all hard classes. that's why i'm here. because i was one of the 69 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. i feel bad telling people that though. it makes me feel stuck-up. i don't want to be stuck up. i know too many people who are and i see others talking behind their backs. i really don't want that to ever happen. actually, i'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in illinois) i had a lot of really close friendships that i left behind. some are still kind-of open ended, i didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. i made my plane tickets today. i get to leave on tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 12th for christmas. i can't wait. i want to see how everyone has changed, and i guess, hope that they didn't change too much. some i was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. i just want them to be safe. tim just asked if i wanted any of his soup. i guess that is what he got for dinner. he's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. my roommate however will take some getting used to. she is muslim and i'm christian. we kind of clash with religious opinions. well, i guess i'm done now!

"well, my first thought is that i don't quite understand this activity. i'm not sure if you want me to tell you my thoughts, as in a journal, or just irrevelant thoughts that pop into my head as i type, therefore i'll just write a journal entry. well, right now i'm mad at my friend because she seems to be choosing her boyfriend over me to hang out with, so i guess that would make me jealous. and it doesn't help the fact that she and her boyfriend are the only two people at ut that i know. another feeling that i'm experiencing is sadness and homesickness. i just talked to my best friend, who is attending the university of north texas, and she was describing to me how much fun she is having and how many friends she is making-this makes me sad because i know that she is having more fun than i am. i think jealousy has a little to do with that also. i talk to my parents almost every day, and they describe their everyday life to me, and i feel left out almost, because i can't be there with them. i miss the normalcy of home. i miss waking up in the morning and knowing who my friends are, and what to expect in my classes. i know that things will change, i'm just really anxious for that to happen. sometimes i doubt if i made the right decision by coming to ut. would things be different if i were at unt with my best friend? i know things would be better. i was always afraid that if i went to unt, my best friend would think that i was going there only because i couldn't make friends anywhere else. i only decided to come here to ut because they have an outstanding business department, and i plan to major in management information systems(mis). i'm a little overwhelmed right now because it seems like there is so much to do. in every single class so much is expected of you. it will just take a little time to get used to everything. i don't adapt well to change-i'm very much a habitual person.

"i am in the library trying to get my work done but i keep on thinking on what else o need to do. i hope i get adjusted to college life quicker so i will not be as stressed out as i am now. i am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, i hope that they are all doing well. some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and i am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow i have to essays due for one of my classes and i kind of do not understand them. i will be glas after i take my first tests and ace them all. everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so i am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. i have been sleeping late and getting up early so i am tired for class but i have to force myself to stay awake and focus. after i am done writing this essay i have to start doing all of my other work so i can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. when i get home i have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. i have to watch what i eat or else i will put on weight and not be healthy. that will affect my studies and others. i hope that my family is doing well because i know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. she already has a stressful life working 50 hours a week, driving home 45 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. i can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that i have to do. when i get out of college i hope to accomplish many of my goals that i have set for myself. like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great gpa, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. i hope the relationship that i am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. i am greatly attached to my girlfriend and i hope that i will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. i will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well.

"today is only the sixth official day of class, and i am already stressed out. i know that i don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but i feel just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. i wish i was already set into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. i get nervous every time i think of what possibly lies ahead. i also have to start looking for a job. i feel i do not have the time to work, but i believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if i have set things to do. i guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. i mean 5-10 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job i could find. i can look in to this of friday considering i only have one class, although i seriously think i should take an extra hour or two to simply lay down and rest. i haven't done that in a while. what else do i have to do on friday? look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and whatever else comes up. let's see, saturday. the game is on saturday, so i guess i will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. at least i will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. so far, i guess i like it here. i mean i am having fun and enjoying myself but i just got use to doing nothing during the summer. no reading, no calculus, no tennis, no stu. -co. or nhs meetings. not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. yet, i do miss tennis. even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it was always a blast. i miss the team especially, and all my close friends. i am the only one of my closest friends that came to ut, but i guess it is all working out fine. if i went with them to college, i would be at a&m. naah, i'm ok here. i can always call them. i miss home. i knew that i would be homesick. even though i like being here, i sometimes wish i was still at home, in my house, with mom, dad, and even lori & angie. gosh, i never thought i would miss those two brats this much. oh, i miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. i need to call her tomorrow. it's already to late. i wonder what they are all doing right now. they are all probably asleep. i'm hungry, actually just thirsty. i could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. i can't wait for this weekend. hopefully i will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 10:30 am. going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. my legs are so sore from all the walking i have to do every day. i'm used to jogging and walking at least 3 miles most days, but walking here is exhausting. uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. just thinking about it makes me tired. i need to get everything i need ready for tomorrow, but i think i am just going to lie down and watch tv till i fall asleep. i am so tired.

"a picture of my girlfriend bri sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. she is beautiful in many ways. her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. i'll tell her that next time i talk to her. my cousin brandon is getting married in october. he is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. when i asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. it should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. it'll be awesome. the wedding will be a lot of fun. i'll dance with bri and such. and i'll have all my family there. well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. too big. 44 first cousins, etc. i remember when my sister got married. good times. i got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. my uncle (brandon's dad) took a cool digital picture. my feet are cold. i'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because i don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. david, my roommate is playing guitar. he is playing a solo that we recorded on trey davis' recording. we recorded and collaborated with trey. good times. i hope he is happy with it. i'll ask him next time i'm in lake jackson. bri is wonderful. i can't wait to see her next month. i hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. it should. and then i'll be able to embrace her like i did this past summer. what an amazing summer, all because i loved her like i should. honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. we're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. everything is willing. everyday i see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. but bri and i are so far past that. and we both know it. and we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. i love her. i'm proud of that because i know i love better than most if you even call what most do love. david and i are working on a new song. it's going to rock. david, you're distracting me. half over. 1:19 am. i need to read, but i'll do that tomorrow. he is still playing the guitar. he is asking me musical questions but i am busy. stream of consciousness! yay. homework. yahoo for school. yahoo for me. *shrugs*"""" - billy madison. great movie. i have it memorized and i recited it in front of rommy in 7th grade when he challenged that i couldn't recite it. good times. i wonder how rommy's doing. he is probably smoking or drinking right now. what an admirable class president. dustin was student body president. good guy. i'll see him on american idol one of these days. my neck itches and i scratched it. my calves are cold now. *stretching calves* mmm. cow. reminds me of steak. yum. i could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools* """"mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime"""" - homer simpson. it would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if i wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. but if i were a local vigilante, i'd hang out on speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and i'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. """"bicycle dismount zone, punk!"""" heh. that's be cool. then they would get up and beat me up. i remember when i use to spend the night at scott's house back in 6th,7th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. i never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time i saw one of those. they were ",0
"i have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. i am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. it was full though, so i signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled """"introducion to italian culture,"""" but i dropped it this morning, because i think it is so irrelevant to anything i am interested in, and i am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. i was signed up to take 15 hours, but since i droppped that seminar, i now have only 12 hours. anyway, i am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is """"interior design. """" i'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but i just thought that is worth a shot. i am sitting in my dorm, hardin house, right now, and i just figured out how to use their computers here. i did not bring my own computer, so i am having to use the computers here. i still do not know how to check my email yet, though. i just figured out how to be able and send email from here. my roommate does have a computer, but i can tell that she would prefer it if i didn't use her's, so i respect that. she has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. we knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. i was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but i think taht it will work out fine. one of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. she is the one who i am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. she got into that class. anyway, in the dorm that i am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. stacy, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. the part that i live in is bigger, but i kind of wish that i lived in the other part. the people that i live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. oh well, i'm over across the street a lot, so i guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. i am so excited that r. u. f. is starting tonight. it is a bible study that i am going to go to. i've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. i miss all of the christian based things that i went to bakc at home. i used to go to campus life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. i also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. she is not much older than i am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that i go through. not taht i have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. speaking of problems, i did get really homesick the other day. obviously, i guess you can tell that i am a freshman. anyway, i got sick , adn any time i am sick i always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. but, i managed just fine. i went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and i am feeling much better today. i still am really tired though. i think that might have been why i got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. well, i have finished the twenty minutes, but i'm sure taht this is horribly written, but i guess it doesn;'t matter.

" this summer has been such a burden on me. i am dwelling in it and it is eating me up. i don't know why exactly we broke up i just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected. i find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me. i just can't seem to let it go. it might be because we were together for so long and go so close. she was the best person god had ever put in my life. we seemed to click, it seemed so perfect, and she told me she felt the same. she told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes. she was scared. she told me i meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her. she had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me. something she hadn't let herself do with anyone else before me. it felt so right. i was at such a high, life was so good. i was happier than i had ever been. i became so dependant on her for happiness. i know that is something that was unhealthy, but she had gotten just as dependant on me. we had so many plans for the future. we planned out every step of the way. factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school. everyone is telling me to move on, but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us, for me not to let her go. she wanted to get through this hell or high water. nothing was going to tear us apart. during the summer we got closer than ever. we had many plans for the summer. we bought tickets to concerts. then she went off to camp. she said nothing was going to happen at camp. four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me. what the hell happened at camp. i go to warped tour and she with someone else. all i can do is give her a hug and say """"nice pick over 6 feet tall and blonde, just like i said. """" seeing as i was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same description. later she calls me and tells me it wasn't what it looked like. i blew up on her. it was a normal reaction. everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring, and then bang, everything comes crashing down. everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there. and i completely defended her. cause i knew her better than anyone else, not only my thoughts but hers as well. she was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past. every male figure in her past had let her down, and she couldn't comprehend someone loving her as much as i did. so because all the idiots in her past, i have to be let go because she can't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together. why did she have to go, we were happy. i don't know what happened at camp. it was more than seven weeks ago that i talked to her. i called this week and left a message she didn't return. i called again today. she picked up we talked for 18 minutes and 36 seconds. she seems perfectly happy, just as free as a freaking butterfly, not caring at all, it seems, about what i am feeling. how is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and i'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable. is everything that has happened a game to her. i don't understand how i can move past this. i can't. i don't what to do. i gave her everything. and it feels impossible to get it back. i still love her more than i love anyone, including myself. all i can do is sit and write songs about it.

"so this assignment is sort of interesting. it's like your thoughts go faster than you think regardless of the speed at which you type. oh, my, that guy in my keyboarding class during my 9th grade year in high school, so sad, i remember he has special assignments because he couldn't handle writing a paragraph. the teacher was lucky if she could get a sentence out of him. what was her name? . i have no idea, i remember seeing her at the mall one day during junior year, and she recognized me. probably because i was one of the only kids who took her seriously. poor gal, it had to be hard to be ignored like that all of the time. at least she was really sweet, so people didn't have real hate for her. ah, the days at hutchinson. i can't' believe my roommate is in the longhorn band, actually the flags. i wonder if she will quit. she doesn't seem to have the time to devote to it. yesterday a returning flag member quit for those reasons. i wish she wasn't so irrational. the day she said she was going to quit, and she got that jar of candy so she stayed~! what is that? candy doesn't make you have time. let's be a little more mature here. get your lips ready? what. it's posted on her computer, i haven't quite figured her out yet, i don't know if i ever will. my friends seem to hate her from the stories i tell, and i'm not sure if i blame them. ah, roommate hell, who does not' experience it. at least we aren't fighting yet. and her stupid camera. i can't' believe she complains about not having money yet she spent 300 dollars on a digital camera. so now she has something else to take up her time, learning how to use it. so so so unproductive. i wonder if she wants to study for the chemistry test together. i hope not, i don't think she is even started the homework and it's due tonight at 11, oh, well i should stop worrying for her. i haven't looked at our fire escape plan, wonder if it's ever been used. i would imagine so with the kitchen downstairs and all, at least the building is only two stories, i guess i have a better chance of getting out this way, in case of a fire. my closet light is still on, and i want to turn it off a lot, but i shouldn't get up from the computer so i'll just keep thinking about it for the next 14 minutes, oh well, nothing i can do about it now. and on the closet light, i can't believe we had to have a sticky note up by the light switch for a week signifying which switch went to what. cristina couldn't manage to remember that the room light was the bottom one. i guess i am just critical of her lack of comprehension and common sense. i learned where the word common sense comes from while reading the psychology textbook. i bet if i thought about if for a second i'd remember what it was. i think it was an incorrect believe that involved the word commas. i'll look it up when i finish. i think it was in chapter one. i have managed to read so much for that class, but i'm still a little behind, only halfway through chapter four and i'm supposed to be done by 330 this afternoon, i really should read like three chapters of that this weekend, i find it fascinating and i want to read it, but my friends have been getting in the way of my studies. that's probably a bad sign. i need to get through to them that i am here to learn. having fun just comes naturally and doesn't require the effort that learning does. i agreed with pennebaker in the handout that you have the opportunity to be in two classes if you read the textbook, and i want to. it's like i built up the desire to learn over the summer from doing nothing, absolutely nothing. i really should have had a job. i made a total of like 200 dollars this whole summer, probably spent like 500 or more. i'm so bad about that. hopefully i will grow out of that habit through the years of college. i haven't even written a paper in probably almost four months. i hope when i take masterworks of lit i don't have too much analytical writing to do (false hope). sigh, candy. i really need to watch what i eat, this whole freshman fifteen will really scare a girl more than people would imagine. i am not going to let myself get all blubbidy. well it's the word that came to mind and that is what they asked for. i wonder if they analyze this crap. like how though. it would be like measuring how many times people say i, or say something negative. ha, i'd take the cake on that one. i should work on my negativity. but that's not something that can just be changed overnight. i should just slowly work on focusing on things more bright and enjoyable. if you focus on the negative for too long you become depressed and nothing makes you happy. and i'm a little prone to that being as homesick as i am. i just miss the people. my best friends, people who's opinions of me are solidly formed and won't change overnight. screw paul! my stupid friend i met here who's already decided he doesn't want to be around me after being full-fledged into our friendship he tells me i'm fake and intimidating. buck up pal. my other friends agreed with me though, i really haven't changed much, he just works me up in his head and then i'm just regular old me in person and he gets himself disappointed. i hope we don't have any, or many, awkward encounters. we shouldn't. he is all into his liberal arts stuff. and i'll never be in that area. i love engineering for that. i don't have to take many classes in stuff that i am not good at or interested in. i don't want to sit around and think about the world and do it in the way i was taught. but i don't want to be a snotty engineer who thinks that i'm better because i'm studying math. aaaaahhh, i hate college politics already. the engineering dean is really really overconfident in the school. i couldn't believe he told us we were better because our overall sat scores were better, duh they were better, the school doesn't have to accept anyone in the top 10 percent of their high school. and the rest of the university does! bah. i can't take that sort of unfounded confidence and bragging. and i think i'll encounter it in many of my peers over the next few years. that stupid closet light is driving me crazy. i want to turn it off so much and i only have to wait another three minutes. my roommate's aim is still on, i bet her cousin, boobs, is thinking i'm her and trying to tease her about enrique. i wonder if there are possibilities of this paper being deemed not stream of consciousness and me having to redo it. maybe. i bet they take a random sample and so some people get caught turning in crap, but others don't, and that guy that pasted the manual just happened to get randomly selected. i wonder if they do the 10 percent thing, simply ten percent of the population, oooooh yeah, i learned so much in statistics. except i don't think i'll ever remember the details. mrs. perez was such a sweetheart, i hope she is doing alright. i miss my high school, for some reason i don't want to type the name of it. so awkward not knowing who is going to read this. hopefully i won't be deemed a crazy . haha, along with the clingies, creepies, doodlers, boppers,. factoids save me. and i'm just about done, sad that i kept watching the clock the whole time.

" i'm thinking about what i need to do before classes start again, but every time i get started, something interrupts me or i just don't feel like doing it. i'm sitting in my room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'wicked"""" soundtrack, it's amazing. my room smelled before, but i cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and i yelled at her because i am not supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. i'm feeling kind of gross, actually. i feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and i was out partying the whole time. i hate when people are like, """"yeah i party"""", but i seriously did the whole weekend. now i feel dirty and gross. i also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week i'm so healthy and so conscious of what i eat, and then the weekend comes and it's like i've never seen food before. what is that about? so now i feel gross because i feel like i ate the entire state of texas and i'm disgusting. i'll get over it. i kind of miss camp right now, even though i would never go back. i miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. i feel like i've been writing forever and i haven't. weird. so back to camp. i miss it because i was so comfortable and so happy. here, i'm not used to everything yet. and i miss those three girls because i know that they will always be there and i've known them forever. i'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because i love to meet new people, but sometimes i long for that feeling of comfort and not having to impress or look good for anyone. you know what i mean? and i also miss adam. this is something i could talk about for a while but i don't really know if i want to. it's our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that i sent him won't get there on the 8th, i feel kind of bad about that. what can i do? it was so weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? i'm running out of things to talk about. i love traci, my suitemate. i knew her from camp and i'm really glad we decided to live together. despite what everyone said, i knew it would be a good decision. we've been getting along really well. i'm thinking about """"friends"""" right now because it's my favorite show. i love it so much, and i'm so sad that it's over. but i'm excited to watch """"joey"""" on thursday. i'm definitely going to support him even if the show sucks, though i doubt it will. this is random but i'm going to run out of soap and shampoo soon, i'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and i need to return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that i didn't need. hopefully i'll get store credit, and then i can buy some stuff. that would be awesome! i need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. i found out that i was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that i'm the furthest thing from a science major. i hate science. well i don't hate it but i definitely don't belong in that class. so i switched into chemistry in context which is for sure more my pace. and i actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and i found out that i bought the wrong book. i just figured something out about me. i hate bad spellers. so random, i know, but i see myself typing and every time i'm about to spell something wrong or i mistype, i get so angry. i don't know how people can just leave words mispelled. i hope nobody reads this because they'll think i'm such a weird kid. which i am, but not everyone needs to know that. my brother, danny, always tells me i'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever i talk about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are surprised when i tell them that he's 16, because the way i talk about him, it sounds like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling us the """"brady bunch"""" because no one ever seems to fight in my family. i don't know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in a while, but she is absolutely the first person that i go to with a problem and she's the first person i tell things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. i'm kind of mad at him though because i haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and he didn't. i hate when people do that. i really don't know what else to talk about. i guess i can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then i'll have plenty to say. i hope that's still following the assignment. so i'll start with olivia geyelin. i don't even know why i'm writing about her because she sucks. i mean, i hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person i know, and she's always complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the dumbest reasons. ew. but i kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst family life ever. ok i'm sick of olivia, now i'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, i used to love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then i realized how selfish and dumb she was. i hate sounding like a bitch but i' m starting with the people i like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl, adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who i'll come back to later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and i hate how much time they spend together. i'm not jealous, i just know that hillary could do so much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and i feel bad for hill because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too, which is so not true. but i've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah salon. i used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as hell, but only if you take her seriously. now i like her a lot more because i'm not scared of her and i don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and i were always able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's always so much fun to be around. i like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she hated her. i'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because i really feel like i've been doing this forever and every time i'm typing, it seems like the seconds don't go by, but every time i pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my head, i don't know. but it's weird. i'm going to start looking at another clock to see how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, i only have favorites left. everyone else left, i genuinely love, they're my best friends. i'll start with lizzie albert. elizabeth chandler albert. i met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best friends. i'm not kidding, i loved her so much and we could always talk about anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, i swear and then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really long time. it really bothered me. i'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to talk to me and i didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now i think we're really close, like reverting back to three years ago. i miss her so much, she goes to wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. i can't wait to go visit her. she's so funny, i always have a great time whenever i'm with her. love her. ok after lizzie comes simone. i met simone actually a long time ago. maybe in 1997. she came to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped going to camp and i didn't see her again until i was in high school. then we became best friends. i love simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature, and it was the best class that i have ever taken. i'm so glad that we were able to be in that class together. i hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one i'd rather be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday, and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty close. her mom works all the time so i feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she goes to bradley which is so good for her. i really hope she's happy. she rocks my world. after simone comes marisa. love marisa. we always knew each other but weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone, lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. i love her family and going over to her house because i always have a good time when i'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what i mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone, never really had any rules. which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and i love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after dances and stuff. marisa and i went to breakfast every saturday morning of our senior year. that makes me so sad that i don't get to do that anymore. she goes to indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually underrated anal but i won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, i'll talk about hillary. i love her. i've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. i honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and didn't get in. ass holes. but i don't think she would have come here anyways. i can talk to hillary about everything. i love her. she goes to illinois. i can't wait to go visit her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but i also can't wait to just talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and i just think that she's great. the first time i came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. she was even my big sister one year. i miss poms. and i miss hill, i need to call her actually because i miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes i make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so now that i only have about a minute left i can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. i met the kid the first day of high school. i was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3 classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even i know myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and i know that i'm in love with him and that i will always love him. i miss him so much. sometimes i don't' know what to do with myself because i miss him so much but i know it's the right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's been great. see you later ",0
"this is a really strange writing assignment. it's hard to write to keep up with your thought s. the u. s open is on tv right now, serena williams is playing monica seles. i'm not really sure who is winning but they look like pretty even competitores. serena is eighteen and she is really improving while seles is getting older now and she isn't as good as she use to be. it's really hard to make myself do all of the work for colloege. there is really a lot of reading and i'm having trouble deeping up. my mythology class has a lot of reading and its pretty boring so i end up putting it off. i really just do the work that i know i'm going to get quizzed over soon like in calculus and eco. calculus is eadsy though because last year i learned al ot in mr. romano's class and the new teacher is just explaining the same old stuff. psy is really interesting in class but i haven't read much for it because i took psy last year in high school and we used the same book. so hopefully that will help me make good grades in it this year. i have so much reading to do for muythologe because we have a quiz on tuesday and it is going to be so hard because the teacher thinks that it is so interesting an that we remember like everything she says or assighns. the horse sale this weekend is going to be really fun. i hope we find another one like eden that will only sell for her broodmare value. i hope shug agrees to take cerise and souther n i've. but if he doesn't then i guess that cristophe will and he is a good trainer. it is so annoying that southern ivy's jockey didn't listen to us in the race. he should have held her back at the beginning but he had to try to be a hotshot. she should have won. oh well, she is only two now, i hope she has a lot more races ahead of her. she could be really good once she gets sorted out. i can't beleive that anita's foal has such bad back legs. it seems to happen every time when we breed to an outside stallion. i hope brittany isn't too mad that i blew our meeting off today. but i just really wasn't in the mood to hassle with all the traffic and everything, besides, i didn't even understand the directions to the place. oh yes!!! its already been twenty minutes.

"okay, i guess this is what all my english teachers described as """"stream of consciousness. """" i believe i did an assignment similar to this in 11th grade. i'm not sure. i wonder how long this writing assignment will be. how much can i possibly type for 20 minutes straight without stopping? what if i get a phone call? do i answer it? anyways, i cannot believe i am in my second week of college. it is kind of what i expected. the freedom can me nice at times, but i do miss my home. i do not miss high school at all though. i didn't like high school one bit. i am more homesick than i ever thought i would be, or could be for that matter. i never thought of myself as someone who would get homesick. but here i am, always wanting to call home. michelle's birthday is tomorrow. i wish i could fly down to spend the day with her. i hope mom remembers to give her the cd i made her. the cd reminds me of justin, whom i also miss a lot. i miss all my friends, all my best friends. one of which is at utd, one going to northwestern in a few days, and one attending texas women's. i really wish i could transfer, or they would transfer to ut. i miss them all so much. wow, it has only been 5 minutes. i don't know if i have 20 minutes of gibberish to write about. this stream of consciousness thing is harder than it seems. i know i tend to ramble on a lot but it is quite different when you are doing it for a class assignment. it is also hard for me because i am so used to typing with abbreviations every time i chat online, making this assignment a lot more difficult. after completing this, i am going to wait for a phone call from my best friend. then, meet up with someone at the library, where i hope to get a lot of studying done. i feel like i am so behind in all my classes. i have a lot of reading to do. senioritis has not gone away, and i have yet to get back into the """"homework mode. """" that's not good. i really would like to leave here with a high gpa. i know that is what my parents would really like. yet, it seems harder and harder as days go by. there are so many things to do here that it seems harder to organize my week. i am usually a very organized person but haven't been as of late. man, i wonder if iris is going to call me anytime soon. i feel like i haven't talked to her in forever. i would really like to fly down and stay with her for a weekend. i'm thinking about the weekend of her birthday. though, i'm not sure if that is a good idea. i need to get the money together first. oh yeah, i also need to get some money for lisa's birthday gift. it's her birthday tomorrow. wow, i wish my friends would chip in money and buy me a camera. that's really neat that ivy is doing that. i'm so glad i finally got my camera fixed. stupid battery. how does a battery die out so quickly? i haven't even had my camera for that long. i put up my collages today before lunch. they look really nice on my wall. i think i put them up crooked though. oh well, i will get used to it, i hope. i would really like to fill up my whole wall with it. that would be so neat! okay, 6 more minutes. man, i haven't typed this much in a long time. my eyes are starting to hurt now, and i still have a headache. today is monday. tomorrow is tuesday. tomorrow is going to be a very busy day, from beginning to end. i will probably be dead tired by the end of the day and won't have enough energy to study. that will not be good. i want to watch tv. i wonder what is on right now. lisa said she was going to watch friends and then roswell. all right, now i am running out of things to type. i don't think my brain works very fast. these last few minutes are going by very slowly. i hope i don't get hungry tonight at the library. i cannot believe i ate so much today at lunch. it is all leeting's fault. all that starch cannot be good for me. i really hope i do not gain a lot of weight while in college. i'm really scared that i will. i haven't been going to the gym as often as i would like. i think i might start going every friday or so. maybe on the weekends too, seeing as how i haven't been in austin for the weekend since school started. maybe that is why i still have not put together a regular schedule. i haven't really been here for a full week. well, this will be my first full week in college. not as exciting as i thought it would be. i think i might call home after i finish this assignment. i'm almost done, thank goodness. i really am running out of things to type. i think i am all drained out. i hope i do not fall asleep studying tonight. i really need to get stuff done.

"writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time, but i have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health. so, maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal. i'm listening to music right now while i do this and it is actually kind of distracting me. its for my history of rock music class which is actually kind of boring, but i heard its going to get better. as i write this i notice how incredibly bad at typing i am. other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 20 minutes. i am going to have like a couple of paragraphs. that is really sad. now, i am thinking all psychological though. i am like oooooh, they are going to read this and think that i compare myself to other people. """" i do compare myself to people all the time. i am very competitive. my arms hurt already. i do badly on computers. i hate staring at the screen. when teachers make you read articles off of the computer, i always have to print it out-which is kind of annoying. i also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when i am not thinking about making it good. i am kind of surprised i made an a in rhetoric. i loved rhetoric. it was really interesting for me. all my classes this semester seem interesting. tough-but interesting. geology is weird. hopefully it will get better. i found out today that i could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking psychology 301. i am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically. so i am sad, but psychology 301 will at least be a good introduction. and now i sound like a suck-up because this is for psych 301. and now i sound like i care about what people think. i do though to some extent. ooooooh fun song on. that swing swing song by all-american rejects. i like it a lot. it reminds me of the summer. i wish i would've seen american pie three. i didn't even see the first or second one though-haha. my room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here. she is strange and different, but she is really unique and i like her a lot. she is never here though. her boyfriend goes to a&m-just like my boyfriend. she always goes to their games and never has even been to a ut game! i told her she should come to the arkansas game with me and she was like """"oh yeah! we played them last week!"""" we. we. she said """"we"""" as though she was from a&m. she is crazy. my boyfriend lives in college station and you will never find me there. there is nothing to do. so, he comes to austin. i realize i have pictures of people in my room that i do not even like. i only have a picture of this girl jenny because she is really good friends with my boyfriend. she and i are cordial to each other in person. we hate each other really though. i know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. i hate that she hates me because i am usually nice to her. but , i hate her too. but she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. so, i think i have the right to not like her. wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. i still have 8 minutes left and i feel like i need to do something else. maybe that means i have add. i cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time. its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. i am behind in all of my classes. i study and read-i just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause i don't catch everything. like i try to keep up, but i can't. its bad. i need to study more but then i stress myself out if i don't do anything but study. i need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. i stress myself when i study 24'7. that is how it was over the summer. everyone else went to frat parties every night and i stayed in and studied. there were no organizations to be in. there were only frat parties. and i don't even like frat parties all the time. drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. and plus boyfriends do not generally like that. so, i stayed in and studied. i was so focused on my grades that i would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85. because i was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, i stressed out so much that i threw up. it was really bad. all of my friends were really worried about me. i passed out and everything. over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. i guess i am just not good with my time management. i don't know. something is really messed up with me i think. my boyfriend thinks i could use a counselor. but if i see a counselor i probably will not have time for activities besides school. and that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. i like that i am doing them. i hope i make lassos. i am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. we shall see.

"i am watching mtv cribs with chris pontius. today was hot and i'm supposed to go running with nathan but it's still too hot so i want to go later. maybe i'll get some of my work done before then so i won't stay up so late like i have been lately. i'm really tired so i took a nap today and slept like a rock. i don't know when i'm going to supper though because i don't want to eat before i work out or i'll feel sick so i might just get nathan to cook for me tonight. i am starting to miss everyone from back home because i'm not usually away from my family, friends, and sam for this long. i guess i will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. i want to go home to see everyone but i really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. i'm running out of things to think about because the tv is on and it's distracting me. the song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. i like all my classes so far but i'm still kind of scared. especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. i'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but i can't get tired and go to sleep now because then i won't get anything done and i won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night i couldn't fall asleep forever and then when i finally fell asleep i kept waking up so i felt like i didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. i'm kind of hungry but lately i haven't felt that good so i don't feel like eating. maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so i'll have someone to sit with. i hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then i sit with people i don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but i want to meet them and not be rude. i'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well i have way too much school work and other stuff to do and i know if i would have rushed i wouldn't have time for anything else and i really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. my back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but i can't get into a back specialist for a while so i kind of just have to live with it. and i love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. i decided that i'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because i really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in lubbock at texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so i went and got him a present saturday with my mom at the mall in san antonio. she wanted me to go back to hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but i wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but i really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake austin and it was really good like seafood'mexican food. i've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while.

"well, lets see, what am i thinking. all i ever really have time to think about is school. i am so stressed out, since i changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, i'm reading for hours each day and i'm not a big reader"""", i read very slow, and i have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. to top it all off i have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and i have another one the thursday before that. talk about brain overload. one thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff i'm reading in all 3 classes and some of it i'm finding in my psych readings too. it's all just overwhelming. this week i have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. i was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but i had class from 12-5 so she was home when i was done with class, so i'll be doing that later and i have to buy all this stuff for it too, i don't have a job, i don't make money, and i don't feel like i should ask my parents for more. the big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $700, that's a lot of money i could really use. i could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, i have all this other crap i have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. he is not in school, he should a job, why to i have to loan him money, well no more-ever. well at least not until i get my money back. to top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, i don't a boyfriend who's in jail, i want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 5-10 years. but it's so hard because i love him, or at least i think it's love, it has to be or else i wouldn't put up with all his crap. it's not just all that, i'm somewhat of a neat freak and i like things to be clean and keep things the way i have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff i've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because i'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that i would even get upset. now he keeps saying are things going to ok when i get out blah, blah, blah. i don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than i can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what i get from school, i don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. i should probably end it, i know i won't cry-i'll miss him but i've already cried enough for him. you know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. i don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. one good thing that came from him is my kitty, bailey. one of his friends couldn't keep her so i took her. she is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. i feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. she is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but i still feel bad, i didn't do it to hurt her but i know sometimes she is in pain. that was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing i have to do for her. she is about 6 months but she is still relatively small, i'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. the world's biggest cat weighed 87 pounds, i can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. i just think that's incredible. wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done.

"pretty much, i have enjoyed my time here at ut. i am taking all my classes, and i am doing reasonably well in them. my calculus class does not seem to be too bad except for the fact that the professor pretty much gives us the book word for word in the form of notes except with indeeds and such that is thrown in there. my sociology class is pretty good, the professor is a nice lady and is very enjoyable to listen to. we discuss all sorts of interesting topics and the favorite one of hers is that there are more than one genders. my chemistry lab is a 5 hour class and it is ok so far, but we have only done a basic lab to measure the density of coke versus diet coke. i still have to write up the lab report but that would not be too difficult to do. my chemical engineering class is very laid back to the point where it is disturbing. we have 1 class meeting a week for a 1 hour period with many of the classes not being taught by the professor, but by other members of the chemical engineering department. there is no final and we end the class in november. to me that just seems a little disturbing. my psychology class is not too bad except for the fact that it is in a huge auditorium that for the most part is very dimly lit. the atmosphere in it is not very helpful to students who are tired after all there classes because it does seem to make falling asleep a whole lot easier. the material covered in the lectures is all very familiar to me as i did take psychology ap in high school and i have kept all of my notes from the class. unfortunately i only managed to make a 3 on the ap exam so i did not get credit. one thing i am contemplating right now is whether it is wise for me to be taking two social science classes when my degree plan only requires me to take one. i have taken psychology before and i found it to be very interesting, but right now sociology is coming out to be much more entertaining and the homework assignments are to watch two good movies (one flew over the cuckoo's nest and empire of the sun) and to write a short paper on them regarding the sociological ideas in the movies. currently i just got off work from the blockbuster on guadalupe street where i had a nice night except for the fact that my brother called me on his cell from houston saying he had run away from home. that was pretty weird when i found out he had run away and what was the cause of it. i did find out that it was all about an assignment that his lacrosse coach had given him and the assignment was an extremely religious one (my brother is an atheist). the coach said that the players were free to give him a book to read on a conflicting point of view, and my brother chose to give him a book entitled atheism, the case against god"""". my parents were extremely mad at him and called him an intolerant asshole. my brother overreacted and called them assholes and said that he did not need parents anymore since they weren't really helping him out. my brother's views on god are basically that there is no god and he doesn't really care what others think about his views on religion. he also doesn't try to convince them of the fact that there is no god, he is merely doing as his coach suggested, providing a book with a conflicting view (my brother hasn't even read the book). i pretty much told john to take a walk and go get a soda so he could cool off for the evening and then head home if my dad hadn't found him yet. one thing about my family is that we are all very stubborn and don't back down from the views we care about. it leads to a lot of fights. after i finish this writing assignment, i have plans to play this really addictive computer game called civilization iii. in the game, you build an empire from 4000bc and research all sorts of technology, manage cities, wage war, and survive. in the current game i have going, i am playing as hannibal of the carthaginians, and my enemies are alexander of greece, caesar of rome, and cleopatra of egypt. currently i am at war with everyone and in the process of wiping out greece. my armies have been battling greece for the past 5 hours of game play time which in years of the game is from the period of 1776 approximately to 1991. it is only since 1980 that i have managed to conquer many cities. egypt and rome were at peace with me until i launched two tactical nukes at the greek cities. the declared war on me and i am not sure why. i did make an official declaration of war against greece and then they attacked me. so now i am building modern armors (good tanks) by the hundreds, working with a communist form of government and i am going to eliminate greece before i wipe the rest of the world out. the only reason i am doing so well is that i have better technology than the rest of them and superior numbers. the can just move faster in their own territory, but i will conquer. i even have a nuke prepared to fire on rome when i start to take them on. farewell, i am off to conquer the world.

"wow! time goes by fast. here i am doing my college homework and it seems as though just the other day i was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in college. time flies and friends come and go. i have met so many people since i have been at this enormous school. i have come to realize that you must take initiative in order to succeed. for instance, i am currently majoring in theatre, but i don't know if that's what i really want to do with my life. if i don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far i can go, i will never figure out if theatre is the way i want to go or not. then there's the question of what i'd do if i didn't major in theatre. i know that i wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time i've had to write this since i have had many computer troubles. i accidently erased the first one and my friend's computer froze when i was writing the other one. i am using my friend robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. right now i'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ut, and they're talking about ross's hair. some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he doesn't want his hair cut. they think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs to differ. anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. i just remembered that i have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my room. i hope it's not stale. maybe i can drink it with my over-do milk. it's past the drinking date. this gum is very stale and i am getting hungry. if i were in my room, i would eat my muffin or the chips that i didn't eat last week because i had to get to class. you see, i feed the birds my second sandwich because i'm full. then i still have chips left over. oh, well. the joys of wednesday sack lunches from towers. i'm used to sack lunches because i've eaten a sack lunch every day in high school. the reason is that we eat in the greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. some of my friends have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers get mad. ah, the good old days. robert and ross and kristi want to order a pizza. that sounds like a good idea. it's late and i have to get up early for my intro to media class tomorrow. college is a time when it seems hard to get any sleep. there's always something you've got to do, or just good old fashioned procrastination. i mean, i don't procrastinate. this isn't even due for another week or so, and here i am, already typing it for the 3rd time. adam sandler is on tv right now. i just learned that his cds have a parental advisory due to explicit content. isn't that interesting. funny how society tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these days. like my friends. they're crazy. children are exposed to so much, like from tv. i never had cable growing up, so i don't know what it's like. we did have channel 13, kera. that was nice. now, we're listening to the doors, which reminds of a midsummer night's dream because my high school did it in the 60's and that was the music we used. well, at least, we used some doors music. we used great 60s music. then i was in a midsummer night's dream in the 90s, and we used original music written by one of the cast members. he wrote the tune for the wiz, and tranfered the words because of course shakespeare didn't write like the music in the wiz. robert just called a guy because his number was on a dollar bill. he's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. then there's ross with his mushroom haircut and kelly, who some say looks like tom cruise, but in reality, he looks nothing like tom cruise. no more than the pizza guy, who looks like a clown. i am afraid of clowns and i haven't even seen """"it. """" however, i did see a stephen king movie on new years a couple years ago with 2 girls from scotland. new's years day was 32 hours for me because i was traveling back from israel. that was a great trip. well, it's been 20 minutes and i feel like there's not much else needed to say.

" well i finally found the website for this place, and now im not really sure what to say. im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. im also very angry at my roommate katie right now. sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. i signed up for an experiment thing in my csd class, and i have no idea where the room is! all it said was totten and the time and i have no idea what that means. i hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. oh i also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. i almost forgot! the ink on my hand is already wearing off, i should go write down the time on paper when im done with this. i really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. but its cool because i want to major in communications. the lady from there never called me back! i should call her again soon. well maybe i can get the application online or something. i wonder whats going on with the guys next door. they're always coming over here to say hi. i think im going to ask vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. poor kris. i can't believe hes sick now because of me! i hope hes feeling better. this chair is really nice! yesterday was pretty scary, i get really nervous about stuff like that. the bells at the tower were really pretty though when they were playing god bless america. i guess its a pretty historical moment, and im glad i was here for that. even though this wasnt my first choice i guess its ok. its kind of big, but maybe i need that. wow its been 8 minutes already. i don't know if this is due by 5 today. wait what is today. ok i ha 3 classes so its thursday and oh ok sept 13. thats tomorrow. this is crazy. i should get started on that map too. i wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. yeah i bet it does. why else would i be writing it. i think it said it was going to give me a printout of what i wrote and something else too. an analysis? i don't think a computer could do that. wow tomorrow is friday already yay i get to see all my friends back home! i have to go see peter and see how forbidden gardens is! he said hes still going to work there until the end of the year i think. i wonder what college he'll end up going to. he could get into princeton, i hope he does. if not hs coming to ut so that'll be cool. uh i can't believe this morning! im so mad at her! i wonder when shes getting back! should i act mad or just let it go? its probably better if i tell her. yeah i will. i think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. i guess im doing that. kind of just whatever pops into my head. oh feelings. wasnt i supposed to write about my surroundings too. i hate messing up and having to backspace! well i still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because i had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. i wonder what chapter im supposed to be on for this class. oh man chapter 2. ok well i have 1 done so that shouldnt be too hard. those notes took me forever! i need to think of a faster way. well i could highlight like in my geography book, but i think i might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. i hope nothing happens today! thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. its hard to type out all my feelings because i think faster than i type, so as soon as i think something, i start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. plus i think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe im not really recording exactly how i think. hmm. gosh im hungry. that breakfast was really good this morning! i thought it was going to be weird since i went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. thier theirselves. that doesnt look right. hey i have 45 seconds left. uh! as soon as i finished writing that the time was already off. this is annoying. ok well i guess im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what i actually wrote nonstop for 20minutes.

"at his time i am at the lab listening to everyone in here typing and some coughing as well. the laser printer doesn't seem to stop printing. i am at the communications computer lab doing this assignment. i am wondering whether or not i will be going home, dallas, next week on friday. i am hoping my friend will take me. i also hope i can bring back my sister, who is presently in dallas, so that she can live with us. that way i don't have to worry about cooking or getting food for dinner. i am glad my pre calculus professor gave me permission to take my midterm on monday, the day after i get back from dallas--if i go. i just looked at the proctors. they are helping some people out with their passwords. i wish i could get a job as a proctor. i think that would be an easy way of getting some money. most of them don't even know what they are doing. i just thought about my major. i hope i can get into the texas creative department in advertising. that would be really neat since i like to do stuff like that. i just read that a lot of students in advertising have earned awards. but i just looked at some of their work and i don't think it would be all that hard to do. i just looked at my watch, i have about fifteen more minutes before i can send this message. a lot of people are leaving the lab know. that stinks, i wish their was a better computer when i got here. right now i'm stuck with this old ibm comp. --the only one in the lab that's still using windows 3. 11. i wish i was home with my family right now. especially since they left for denver today. if only i didn't have school right now, then i could live at home and help my dad with our family business. a lot of these computers in here are down. it sure would help if someone would fix them. jesse holman jones--so that's who this building is named after. who is he? i've never heard of him. the sign on the wall says, """"lumberman, banker, publisher, statesman. """" what does that have to do with communications(except """"publisher""""). i still have to do my rough draft for english. oh well, i will probably do it tonight when i get home. not like i can get any work done their. my brother is too loud and annoying. he doesn't let me study in peace. he is pretty stubborn--likes to have everything his way. just because my parents aren't here, he thinks he's my guardian or something. i wish i lived in a dorm instead. that would have been cool. that way i could have met new people and friends. not only that, it's right there on campus and they have cafeterias. that would help a lot. now i only have six minutes to go. this thing is taking a pretty long time. if it weren't for this assignment i could have been working on my english paper right now. i hope that paper turns out good. at least my professor liked my proposal-he said i did an """"excellent job. """" in class he was saying how rare that case would be. hopefully, i'll do well in this class. i really don't like english classes. their so boring. all you do is discuss a lot of things, write papers, and practice grammar. i thought my english class would be very large, instead it ends up having only 25 people. i hate small classes. at least all my other classes have over one hundred people. well, i'm done. i guess i will send now.

"tomorrow i'm going to go back to my hometown of grapevine, texas, where i get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. i guess i'm looking forward to the weekend, however i realize that i am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at ut. currently my roommate is pondering why i listen to so much music all the time. to tell you the truth, i really don't know why i do. one of the reasons may be that i grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. i just saw the mtv music awards, which was ok. i mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. some bands these days i can hardly consider a """"band"""" in the least sense of the word. i just remembered that i missed my si meeting tonight. that which i am not too happy about, but i shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. sometimes i wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. i mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent that bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. i've been to other places and apartments, and i think i still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that i recieved. i hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. i get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. i'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, i'll be up for a while. sometimes i wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. in this summer alone, 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 2 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. i guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. it's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. luckily i was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. i never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. i mean what can you say?? i'm sorry? you'll do better next time?? hardly. it feels like i'm typing into a diary or something. which i don't keep. i really want to go see some live bands here in austin. i mean it is supposedly the live music capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 6th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else i could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really really cold. man is it cold. i wish i had something to eat as of right now. i'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. i hate doing laundry. i especially hate ironing. but i guess they're something that i'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. i think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. it just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right? some people i know take it way to the extreme. i wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now i'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl? who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy'girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. i guess it wasnt """"weird. """" just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool i guess. now i also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that i would be detained by the fbi for some criminal knowledge that i may possess for some odd reason. who knows.

 right now i am sitting at the computer feeling very good that i am finally doing this assignment. it had been on my mind ever since it was assigned. i can't wait till i am done. because i know i will feel a sense of accomplishment . ever since the lecture on tuesday every time i think i can picture that video we saw in class where the part of the brain was warming up or so called cooking. i imagine my brain is cooking right now trying to think of what to write next. earlier today i found my emotions changing alot today and i tried to figure out why they changed so much at one point i was extremely shy and the next minute i was outgoing. right now i feel very comfortable with myself and extremely confident. my thoughts are going every which of way right now. because i feel pressure to do well in school from myself and my parents. i really would like to please them and show them i am responsible and smart. i feel as though it is not me right now. i find it truly fascinating that my mind is coming up with some of these things right now. i find it really intriguing. now even after going to class i really feel like hearing the lectures really has made me realize alot of stuff i had not noticed before especially trying to feel what i really feel not what i just think i feel. it just occurred to me that i have not looked up once to see how much time has gone by. i could write this for a while just tracking my different thoughts and feelings and emotions. when i mentioned something earlier about my parents and how i wanted to impress them. i pictured my parents and started having feelings of love because i know they are there for me if i need them. i never have stopped and traced my thoughts before until now. i am wondering now if the tests are going to be hard in this class. i feel pretty hungry right now so i can imagine my stomach relaying something to my part of my brain telling me it is time to eat. i wish i could get controller the part of my mind that controls addiction because i sure would like to quit smoking. i feel as if i have no control over it anymore. when i smell cigarettes smoke. i feel my mind say wouldn't it be nice to have one of those. i guess quitting smoking is telling that part in your mind no and to be stronger than that. that was weird how my mind suddenly brought up smoking i guess because i know i have to quit because it is so bad for you. well that's time i really enjoyed this assignment. ,0

"i just got back from math class, and surprisingly, i feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 2 weeks. or i should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. but anyway, i'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. i like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining'comical, unlike my economics class. i dread that class every monday, wednesday, and friday, and i would not be surprised if i fell asleep in that class today. but there is one advantage to going to economics salina, or should i say natalie. i got to stop calling her salina. i wonder if she gets offended. i hope she knows that i mean well, and besides, she's so cool. not to mention, fine as all hell. i wonder what i'm going to do tonight, i hope i see amy. woooooohh deeee! she is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl i have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. and yes, i am keeping annie in mind. annie would be a close second. i wonder how annie is doing, i miss her. i should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 2 weeks ago! that's alright, i can just come up with another excuse, like always. that could be the problem with me. i just put things off and blame it on laziness. but i don't want to go into that right now, because i would need 20 different 20 min writing sessions. that sucks that i was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because i was about to be on fire. i wonder how many words per minute i've been typing. pretty good, i'm sure. it's surprising that i haven't mentioned jared, or dom i don't give an f about those guys anymore, and i wouldn't be one bit discouraged if i never saw them again. you better believe that. i could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. anyways, i believe that it will catch up to them someday, and i'm going to let nature take it's course. i know for a fact that miles doesn't have anything going for him, i mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from subway! not to knock subway, but i would expect more out of him, or maybe not. dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. jared, i hate to admit, is smart, for now. but oh yeah, it'll catch up. all those drugs are going to bake his head, i can already see it happening. sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. usually, i would wish for their wellbeing, but i have been through far too much. right now, i seem malicious towards them, but in 2 weeks, i'm sure i just won't care. has it been 20 minutes, because it feels like about 2 hours. i'm going to check the time, i know, i know, that's cheating, but i have to! here i go. i'm back, i've got 4 minutes left. so, there's this kid i used to know from middle school, his name is iraj. he's iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. i'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. he's got pink hair for crying out loud! and i think he's the only kid that i have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. i think it suits him, and suits him well. i'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. he actually told me that i used to look more iranian in middle school, which i think is just crazy. i would say it's the other way around. basically, he's really cool, and i wish him well. i just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. it's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. alarm? oh yeah! i guess i didn't have to check half way through. i don't think i can stop typing, it's like i'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and i really like it. it's like i can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. however, feedback would be so beneficial. i'm going to force myself to stop right now.

"ok, so i guess i am just going to start writing about anything. today has been a busy day, i got a lot of things done that i needed to so that is kind of a relief. i am really stressed out right now so i am trying to organize what i need to get done in my head. i finally get to move into my new home tomorrow after class. i have been homeless for the past month. the past few weeks i've been staying with friends but it really sucks not having a place of your own. i feel really disorganized right now and i hate to start the school year out that way. the next few days are going to be busy moving in. i got ut vs. ou tickets today. that's one thing i don't have to worry about anymore. but now i need to get that trip organized. casey, karoly, austin, and c. j. have all committed. i need at least one more person to commit so the hotel room won't be too expensive. that shouldn't be hard though so i am not going to think about that now. i really want to go running right now but it's the middle of the day and really hot. i think i might go anyways. then i'll come back and shower, pick up casey from class at 5:40, and start getting ready to go out. the band we're going to see starts at 8. that is going to start the night out early. but, i guess that is a good thing because then it will end early, which means more sleep before class in the morning. i am listening to some music right now that makes me want to dance! what sucks is that i can't dance though. i wonder why god gives some people rhythm and some not. i hate not having rhythm because i love music. people say that everyone can dance, just do it, but i am proof that that is not true. oh well. i need to get over that. my neck hurts, i guess i slept on it wrong. i hate it when i have a crick in my neck. i really feel like running today. i wonder why. running dancing where is all this energy coming from? i haven't gotten much sleep in the past couple days. i think my body does better when i don't get as much sleep. when i sleep late i feel depressed that i wasted part of the day and i am still tired. today i woke up early and i feel productive. let's see what all i did. i went early and tried to draw football tickets. they told me to come back later so i went back to my friend's place and called my mom. i made a dentist appointment which is long overdue, drove to my storage place and paid a bill, found out i could move in tomorrow at 3:00, bought a few cds i've been wanting, went out to eat for lunch, and then went and got the football tickets. now i am doing some homework. next i am going to run, hopefully not die of a heat stroke, then tonight i have a ticket to see a band play i have been wanting to see. that will be fun. i thought about taking a nap but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. i guess i'll just have a couple cups of coffee before i start drinking some beers. well, it looks like my time is up. this assignment reminds me of my emails to my friends. i just sit down and type whatever comes out and they end up being really long, boring, and pointless. kind of nice i get to do it for a grade and not annoy my friends. peace out.

"i'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing. i don't know why i was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because i'm subconsciously afraid of what i'd write. but my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 20 minutes and i'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to mozilla calendar. i'm already typing more coherently than i thought i was going to (caffeine, maybe? doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 1:56 already. if i get to the cafeteria too early i'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because i ignored the castilian food service schedule. i guess i'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from austin. roommate's explaining the facebook to suitemate right now. his music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety. i've heard beenie man and uhhhhh young buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me. i was expecting my writing to be more ulysses-like; that's a great book: i even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that i did at home, either) there's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like james joyce, down to the facial hair and everything. god he's annoying, sucking up to herr doktor and asking questions that --- a nerf basketball just hit me. damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious. not that i have anything against him for looking like james joyce. i picked my glasses because they looked joycean (my dad has the same glasses as noam chomsky). the tiny old vietnamese woman (7:23) at my optometrists (all the employees have been vietnamese. ong, doan, tran, quach, nguyen, &c. ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'. it sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy. (8:39) suitemate probably thinks i'm vaguely antisocial because i'm typing furiously instead of playing nerf basketball with him and my roommate. the ball just went under my bed; there, he got it. missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again. i was tempted to bring ummmmm not ulysses. finnegan's wake (no apostrophe, i remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that i already have too lofty of literature here (i was afraid of seeming to effete if i was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from college station, but it's fine) but i already have enough unread books on my shelf. not that i don't intend to read it all sometime. last time i checked i was on page 168 which i think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all. somewhere i read that joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision. which would make strauss happy. it's funny what you learn from harpers magazine. apparently the record at shots at the nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 4. or maybe 8. maybe adam made 8 and david 4? i wasn't really paying attention, but ooh, my sister just signed onto aim. we need to try that mediterranean restaurant on 24th sometime. i occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that i'm paying attention to their little basketball game david made 3 now. adam's trying from distance, missed. standing right next to me, apparently i'm 3 point range. when i grow up i bet i'll have to patronize my kids similarly. 16:14 i can eat before too terribly long, then i'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar david just backed into me. ewww this 50 cent song is so violent. at first i thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy. 17:41 he's putting the onion volume 14 back on my shelf, upside down. they're leaving for dinner, asked me if i wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment. he doesn't think he like's quesadillas. they're ok, but i prefer them without too much stuff in them. which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that. so i'll be down in a few seconds. unless the elevators take too long which they do. what else. aim. got my course packets today. it was easier to find but abel's i had to search for. done!

"boy bands they suck big time. i'm listening to the radio right now and one of the 50 is on. i do not see the huge interest in them. they all seem fake since new kids on the block. they were the original hotties! i can't tell if it's my allergies or if i'm getting sick, but my nose has been running ever since this past weekend. i got to go see my niece and nephew this weekend. i really enjoyed that. for once i got to go out of town on labor day. my parents always said next year, or later this year. i'm amazed we got out of texas this year. we were supposed to go to italy this summer, but that fell through. then we were supposed to go to new york, and that didn't feel right. then we all finally decided on orlando. my brother was going to bring his girlfriend and we were all going to have a great weekend break from the routine. that didn't work either. we ended up cutting that one to. finally we decided that it was our turn to go to california to see my nieces and nephews. it was fun, but they sure are weird. i have an older half brother, an older half sister, and an older halfhalf sister. we really aren't related, but we are still pretty close. we have a lot of fun together. i don't talk to my half sister anymore. she's a bit. sorry. she's mean and selfish. she told me that i stole her dad from her. she has some serious problems. she has to be the center of attention, and she's always trying to be better than everyone else. if something good is happening between two people she has to stir things up. she's a complete brat. she's too used to getting everything her way. i hope my roommate can't see up my shorts. i don't know if this is something that happens with time, but i really don't like underwear anymore. i don't understand how some people can wear the granny kind of underwear. sorry if i am offending you. but hey, this is my stream of consciousness. i'm really looking forward to this class. my mom had a lot of fun teaching it. i've always wanted to be like her in some way or another. i've always looked up to her. somehow she is always right. there are the few occasions, but for the most part she's always right. sometimes it makes me sick. i'm running out of things to talk about. hmmm. i miss my friends from wimberley. i'm a freshman. so many of my friends went to different schools or are still in high school. i was the oldest in my group of friends. my parents keep telling me how some of the girls are looking up to me, and want to be like me when they get to college. i love to hear that kind of stuff. it really keeps me in check. yeah! one of the songs i always sing with a girl i hung out with all summer is on. it's weird, but it seems like juniors and freshmen always hook up. i don't mean like going out, but also in just hanging out. it seems like there's always two years in between close friends. i have a friend who just turned 16 and she is so pumped. i feel really bad, because her mom and step dad are getting divorced right now. she just moved from her last home. i'm pissed at her step dad. he said that he wanted a divorce because he felt he wasn't providing enough for his child, which is crap!. he gave her everything she ever asked for, plus some. so now he has put my friend, her mom, and her brother out in the cold. he's a jerk. i'm not going to go any more into this subject. i'd get too heated. this time has really passed pretty fast. i'm surprised! i don't get why people drink alcohol. i just don't get it. i have plenty of fun sober. sometimes more fun than my friends have, and they have hang overs the next day. it makes no sense to me. being sober's the way for me! well, this was fun. i'll chat with you later!

"i am going home for the weekend, and i'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. i miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. i mean, i'm not sad or anything, but i really cannot wait to get there. i'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at ut. memories of high school, things i did, things i said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, i often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. i think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where i want to be right now, most of the days, that's where i'd like to be. i think about the solos i took on various songs, the ideas i came up with, and the ones i'm coming up with now; i wish i could be in it to play them, i whistle and hum the different rhythms that i would play, my friend and i try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. i also am thinking about my family and friends, how i miss them, and how i'm going to them this weekend. i think of how i want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. i'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not i will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, i think about my sister in houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how i'm going to corpus this weekend. but i know that we'll see each other soon. i think about my room at home. the food i'm used to eating in corpus, how i really want to eat there because i'm tired of this dorm food. i try to remember as much about home as i can, but there always seems to be more that i think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when i was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. i just can't wait to be there, and i can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. i also think about my classes here, how i'm wondering how i'm going to do in them, if i'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. i hope that i will do good on my first tests, and i hope that the semester is not too hard as long as i study and keep up with everything. i think of my classes at high school, whether i was that smart or not, i wonder if i'm smart enough to be an engineer, i hope that i do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like i'm stupid or something. i think all of these thoughts right now, and like i said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like i'm thinking about everything at the same time, and i guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while i think about everything i can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph.

"okay, i am very frustrated right now. i just tried to complete the pretesting survey and i was unable to get on to the web site. i tried for a long time and it still wouldn't work. anyway, i have so much work to do and i don't feel like doing any of it. and just thinking that i have my economics class at 8:00am tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better. i can't wait until my weekend comes. this past weekend was awesome. my friends came up to visit me for the whole weekend and we went out and stuff. my boyfriend, who i haven't seen in about a month, also came up with one of my best friends on sat. i was really happy. gosh!!! i am really uncomfortable in this chair at this desk. i have to put the keyboard in my lap because we don't have anywhere to put it. my back is hurting. my roomate looks like she's really comfortable in her bed while i'm here all twisted in my chair trying to type. i wonder why i'm having trouble thinking of things . it should be easy to just type whatever comes to my head, but, it's like my mind is not all here. i can't believe that i almost lst my key today. i got home after being gone to two cclasses and i realize that my key is gone. i don't have fifty dollars to just throw away. i wish i was kind of rich. no, not rich just better off than i am right now. i would just like to live comfortably. with just a little extra cash in my pocket. ouch ! my back is really bothering me right now. maybe after i finish this i should go and check if i can get on that pretesting thing again. waht is i keep haveing trouble with it? and, what if i never get it to work? then what? well, maybe i can go to somebody elses computer to do it. i wonder if it's the computer that is not working. i don;t know . but then again, i'm also computer illiterate. i can't bele\ieve that 20 minutes have not gone by yet. ohhh, i;m so tired. i still have to do more homework and i'm sleepy. i'm also getting kind of lazy to go work out, but, i have to go because i missed this whole past weekend. i feel like i'm getting fat even though i eat salads and baked potatoes every day. the jester food is gross. ooh, that late night food last night was so gross. it was extremely greasy. eating that stuff on a regular basis can make you really fat in no time. i hope i don't gaing those freshman fifteen . that would suck. i don't' want to gain any weight at all. i've seen too many peaple come home really fat after just a few months of coolleege. i'm really tired of typing already and i really want to stapo. i can't even spell anymore. i really hate thursdays. i have too much stuff to do on thursdays. my day is ruined at 8:00 when i have to go to economics . from then on it's jsut hell. then biology is really long. it's not a bad class it's just really loong.

"i wonder if jeff will like the game. it is a shooter type game and does have a fun factor that is pretty high but will it last us until playstation 2. maggie. i want to see her again. hopefully a couple of weeks from now. i am starting at 4:23 so 4:43 is when i will be finished. this wristband is the most stupid idea and it sucks that i can't take it off. i have to get up really early on thursday to get my tickets to the game. jeff and i will go to target well maybe not. we will look at the magazine for a while or on the internet and see if we can find some games. why the hell did i turn the fan on it is so cold. i don't know what to do for dinner maybe i will read before hand so that we can watch highlander. i should ask grace if she wants to eat with us. damn only 4 minutes have gone by. that whistling noise needs to be fixed but i guess i'm already used to it. mike i must call mike about the dbz movies. maybe when i have some money duh. why the hell did i bring that statuette. i could easily fit it in with my stuff. i want to be laying next to maggie and want her to be with me all the time. this cell phone thing is going to be expensive. good the light is still flashing. man its really hard mapping your own thoughts. once i find a thought to write about my mind concentrates upon writing it down instead of just free thinking. carpet is nice. it would suck not to have it the room would be colder than it already is. i probably need to wash my clothes soon i am running out in my drawers. why is my keyboard making this strange thumping sound when i hit the space bar. it never did that before. maybe because i am alone and there is no other. what's up amar. amar just came in. someone standing behind you is really annoying. ha ha. jeff will be back at five. we need a new game. sleeping with my girlfriend was great. damn my morals! windows sucks my ass. sit down and play some games. 4:38 sweet! yes my air vent is really annoying. pool would be cool. yah i played pool in a while. not really that good. you have your own stick bastard. i didn't know you have to have your own here that sucks. come back soon. oh well at least he is nice. i so badly want to have sex with maggie but my religion and morals, life tells me not too. it would ruin both our lives. we could do it protected but there is too much risk. the amount of pleasure is not as great as the amount of possible pain, suffering, and problems we could incur. yes its 4:43 i am done. out.

"metallica. some of the old stuff so its a lot more music and fewer lyrics. but really, now that i think about it, twenty minutes is a long time to write. at some times, my head is full of random thoughts i can write about but there are not too many tonight. i think part of that is because i am tired. i knew mondays would be long when i registered for classes and ended up with a lab from seven to nine on monday night. but today seemed long. at least my classes are manageable except for calculus. i think i will have to work harder to keep up in that class. actually work hard just to stay with it instead of working to be far ahead. well maybe i won't have to take too many more difficult math classes after the next couple of semesters, especially if i transfer out of elec. engineering and go into the business school. but i heard the other day that not many of the classes you take in the engineering courses transfer well to business so i may have to start over. i know that the computer science course i added will not transfer but i decided to take it anyway because i would like to know how to program at least in a general way. never know when that could come in handy. it sure has been hot the last few days. weeks. months. i have also had to walk all over campus just to get all of the administrative stuff out of the way like paying my add bill today and getting the sports package over at the stadium. i got a lucky break and got to pay in the ugl instead of having to wait in the very long line for the cashiers in the main building. a lot of stuff has happened in the last few weeks. i wonder how tricia is doing. and daniel. and chad. he really had a tough week last week. i feel bad about writing that screwy email. it just reminded him that he didn't get to go to the college he wanted. i wonder what caused the extra fees? too bad he won't get to play football for them. that reminds me that we are going to the game saturday. i need to go get tickets tomorrow. in the morning after class. the food has gotten bad over the last few days. maybe it comes in cycles of the stuff i like. or maybe they just serve the good, fresh stuff the first week or so to give the impression that the food is actually good. that is the funnier one to tell. it is always good to have a good cafeteria joke for all of the family and other people back home. sterotypes of college. most are at least partway true but sometimes it gets tiresome trying to explain the real so you just let them believe it and so forth and so on this paper is dragging on i really don't think they mean to read them all. should i include all of this stuff or just do some selective deleting? i guess if anyone reads this they will never know anyway. what do you think? do you think i deleted anything? that will remain one of life's little (very little) mysteries. that about does it for the twenty minutes. only a few seconds to go. i wonder if i will finish with this sentence or if it will go on until the time ",1
"well, i don't exactly know why i'm doing this, but i do enjoy the idea of trying to figure out what's in this head of mine. sharon's checking her email, but she will be leaving soon to go get a bagel. i'm not that hungry because i had a huge breakfast. there are a lot of people in this library. i wish i had internet connection at home because it would be so convenient. i wonder what my parents are doing right now. i wonder if their business is doing well. i wonder when they will be able to retire. i wonder when god will essentially allow them to stop working. god works in mysterious ways, and that's what makes him god i suppose. i'm really glad i got to talk to paul last night online. he is a nice guy. i got to talk to carol too, but really didn't have much to say, which is not surprising. there's a lot of interesting different people here at ut. such a contrast from plano west, where everyone wants to be popular and only buys the best things in life. but are the things they think are the best really the best? don't think so. i miss home, but i really do enjoy it here at austin. i haven't been homesick at all, which might be a good thing or a bad thing. i feel like i abuse my parents so much, verbally. i don't ever take into consideration the fact that they have feelings too. i just say whatever to them and never think clearly. in a sense it is good to be comfortable with people, but being completely immune to their well-being is not good at all. why am i such a malicious person? i think sometimes being malicious on purpose might be better than being malicious without even thinking, because then that means that being malicious has become second nature. i really need to work out more often. i've gotten so freaking lazy, and as a result, fatter, or ?healthy? as my parents call it. why am i so frugal, actually it shouldn't even be considered frugality because it's to the point of stinginess, like scrooge. i don't get it. i try to not think about how much money i spend, but i get so greedy and selfish. i seriously think that if food wasn't so essential to life i would probably not eat and horde money all day. why god? actually i shouldn't be questioning you. i'm sorry. it's my fault. i am just an evil person. that's it. we are all just naturally evil. well, that sounds too hobbes-like. we do have good in us, but we are all sinners no doubt. but i seem like my sins all go unnoticed because i do them so often and i don't realize it anymore. i've got 10 minutes left on this. shar's going to the restroom. i have so much reading to do. and sometimes i feel like i read and read and read and study, but then when i get to class i feel like i did nothing at all. wow, 10 minutes is a pretty long time. not when watching television or a movie. i guess time does fly when you're having fun. i wonder who thought that one up. i haven't seen a movie in the theater in awhile. i wish there was a dollar theater close by. i wish i could get a job. i wish i could manage my time better. i should really take into account opportunity costs of everything i do or buy. sometimes i wish i was more economically conscious but then i feel like sometimes i'm too economically conscious. i do too many things for my own good. i never think about other people. instead, i think how much of my own money, energy, etc. is going into making someone else happy. that's so wrong. man, i have psych in about an hour. i wonder what we will talk about. i wonder if i read enough. i wonder how my first quiz in college will be like tomorrow. i really need to stop eating so much and work out more. i cannot possibly rationalize all my eating by my walking to and from school everyday. 5 more minutes. i wonder what god thinks of me. maybe i shouldn't wonder. what else is there to say? i feel like my brain has been racked and pried. is that how you spell the past tense of pry? i have so much reading to do. did i mention that? by the time i get home, i will probably be so tired. but i need to read. shar's going to her echo meeting so i will be home alone with no internet access. man i am so spoiled. as early as 1-2 years ago i didn't depend so highly on technology. but look at me now. well, i guess we should look at ourselves now. what to say? i wonder what my parents think of me. i think too much about what other people think of me. i need to stop and think about what i think about myself. i thought that girl looked familiar. hmm. i'm almost done dude. almost done. only 1 minute left. i have written a lot. well at least i feel like it. now that i'm almost done i feel like the 20 minutes went by really fast. so i guess this was both enriching and entertaining to see what's in my brain. 10 seconds. done!

"ok. so i am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing i don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although i don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, i have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when i sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. i'm hungry. but i don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, i can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that i am hungry now. i want to eat now. maybe something small when i get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. i can wait. i guess. i wonder if they think its cheap that i'm inviting them over on monday. this way i order the cheap monday madness pizza. but i guess its not really a big deal. i was going to invite them over soon. i want my computer up and running asap. i can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. i hope bilal and them come tomorrow. i mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. i smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, i guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. i mean, lots of people do smoke, but i just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. i don't think i was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was i? oh well. that's what i'm doing. haha i can't believe i was so stupid today. i have been going to urdu class at 12 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if i had gotten there right on time, i would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing i went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! i really didn't think that she would let me sign in. i came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, i have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. i have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. i guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. i don't think i have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as i had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. i like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and i'm upset with raza. i didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. i don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. i'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like i have been typing for twenty minutes straight. i guess this wasn't so bad after all. i wonder what happens after my time is up. will i not be able to type anything else? well, i will find out in 40 seconds. now after this, i got to pick up my i'd from the business school, then. then i dunno. i could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or i could go home and study"""". but that will never work. hmm, i think i just answered my own question.

"at this moment i,m really thinking about what i'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. i missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. i'm munching as i do this assignment, but i don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but i don;t know why. what is it with these computers anyway, i've been screwing with mine for three weeks and i can't figure it all out. i hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. no where can i find my freaking e-mail to check it. i don't even know if i really have an address because i registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. i figured out why food and computers don't mix. my fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. i like this assignment- i'm getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. i knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. now maybe i'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. it must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but i would probably have fun because i'm a camera hog anyway. i should have paid more attention in typing class. i know i'm not using the right """"home keys"""" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. i hope i don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because i'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. i feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but i doubt that they are home and studying like i am. my mom didn't call back from work. she may not have even got the message thyat i called. mail takes way too long to get here from dallas. i thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. today's the eighth and i just now got stuff from tyhe second. tomorrow is jenna's birthday. i guess i'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. if i was her age zi don''t know if i would want a big sister. i guess it might be neat. i hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. i don't know what she does withall herw time. she always studies but she never gets anything done. i don't do much of anything, but i always getstuff done. i guess it's time management skills. i sleep too much. i think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?

"i really wish i didn't have to do this. actually i don't want to do homework at all. i don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing. i actually didn't even start reading any of my books until i knew i had to for an economics quiz. this weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and i really didn't. i did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class i'm taking. i am really disappointed that i didn't get to see my friends in arlington, but i did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice. i miss them but i love college and austin. i also hope that i get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better. unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so i don't mind that. cat's here and she's talking. jessica is here and she's messing with channels. earlier we watched the u. s open after she got home and we watched justine henin-hardenne lose. yay. oh, i really have to sneeze and i'm kind of thirsty. i really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco. one time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke. today i talked to alicia's mom more that i talked to her. i actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on. i hope she is doing ok at unt because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when i have talked to her. i talked to amanda today too and now i'm so frazzled and distracted. cat and jessica are loud and i can't even complete a train of thought. it's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer. is william faulkner the dean? i don't know but i'm so excited about ut. jessica has a lot of clothes, food, and books and i think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff. today i bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to kinsolving. later, i tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and jess made fun of me because i couldn't put it on. i just told cat that she couldn't have a kleenex and it was pretty funny. i really like college and all the people i have met so far. they are so nice and i love them.

"right now it is 7:30 and i am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. i'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so i may make some references to what he is saying. today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think i just over slept. i was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when i go home this weekend. and i need to go shopping for my brother before i get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what i need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but i want to get him something he will really like. my dad and my brother came in this weekend and i was so happy to see them. i only wish i knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because i wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope i didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome god is. he has done so much for me. and i just wish my dad would let god bless him as well. all i know is that without god. i would not make it through every day. i'm really blessed that the people i hang out with are strong christians. i just hope that i am a strong influence on those who don't know christ. i'm really glad i get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. i need to start managing my time better soon. or i am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since i last ran. not good. i have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope i'm thinking but what i'm writing is all i am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that i am in college and as stupid as it sounds i don't have towels coming out my ears. and i have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which i love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know i'm listing to this guy whose room i'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow i start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than i thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and i'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over.

"well i guess i can start with my dream last night since that is what i've been thinking about all day. it was so crazy. i had a dream that i was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. i open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in. well she walks i and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear. i don't know what she was saying but at that point i wake up in my dream as i'm struggling to move my body. i couldn't move until i realized i was out of my dream, which was maybe 3 seconds later. how creepy is that. when i woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then i completely forgot it. i don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me. i've felt ghosts before but i never felt a bad sense coming from them. weird. i always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean. i mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? i am a little worried about that but i haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone. that i can think of. oh well. anyways i have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if i want to enjoy the weekend like i should. hopefully i will be studying on the beach saturday night. not that the south padre beach ids that beautiful. after going to cancun for a week though i guess its hard to actually top that beach. that was the best time i believe in my life so far. it is good to know that i will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip. saving the money was super hard but i feel like if i really want to do something i am capable of making that happen. i hope this weekend is as good as last weekend. i am going back to san antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit. i really love the night life over here though. maybe because everything is so new over here and i really love change period. i am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter. i came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city. now i know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale. i really miss my best friend a lot though. her and i hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter. she was all i needed and i was the same for her. now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children. its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time. her relationship with that boy is so lame. thank god i have no time for stuff like that right now. i cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time. hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her. man. this is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer. everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much i am typing. they keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me. hahahahahahaha! lets see well i've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find. but unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal. this life sciences library is really nice. i think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here. there are always open computers in here as well. well my time is almost up. my experience in the psy class is very important to me considering i want to be a psychiatrist one day.

"at the moment i'm sitting in my room enjoying a 44 oz. slurpee. a cherry and coke mix, which is my favorite. i have been relaxing after another crummy cafeteria meal thinking about the days occurrences. tuesdays and thursdays are rough because i have to go to class all day. classes aren't really that bad but they seem to put a large strain on the mind making a body feel worn out. the course load for me this year is tuff and it seems that i have little free time left. this is a very strange assignment in my mind. i can't see what y'all can get from hearing me ramble on about nothing, but if it helps then i guess its worth it. chapter two in the psy. book is very interesting in fact i have found the course to be interesting. to bad it comes after an hour and a half of chemistry and the most boring class i have ever been in. the selection of girls in the class isn't bad either. so an interesting class combined with good looking scenery is a big plus in my book. whoa brain freeze. damn i hate those. well after this i have to start on my m 408d homework. now that is one hard class. that one and chem 302 are going to be the death of me this semester. it seems like a 20 minute free flow writing assignment seems like it would be hard, but once you start it just seems to flow, kind of like a good rap song. i really like rap the combination of a good beat and a master on the microphone to me is really fine music. however, i love oldies too the beatles, mommas & the pappas, the monkeys, and so on are really good listening music. kind of like returning to my roots i guess. well that was twenty minutes so i'll shut up now hope this was enough to fulfill your requests.

"there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well i guess it'll give them more to think about. there is this song on rt now i think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot. i love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest british accent. i've been to britain well i mean england. either way i want to have a friend who is british like a guy friend i guess because i don't think id want to date a british guy, they all have gross teeth, i don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something. oh i don't think i've ever seen a british person with braces either i guess it has to be something to do with the dentist. i just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, i have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending. i'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person i am talking to will be like wait i thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then i'm like well yeah them too. well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, i don't think i have a fav that everyone else like and i don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way i absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and i bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you. i've lost my train of thought, what i was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense. my roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, i don't know if i could deal using one of those for everything, i couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever. i think i should get my blood sugar measured, because i think since i have been at college all i do now is eat, and not healthy foods, i have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure. i was just thinking about how i looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, i'm not as comfortable being in one as i used to be. oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team? and i was like no but i think i want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh aren't tryouts this weekend? and i was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you're really really good, i was happy to hear her say that, just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend, i got back to my dorm room and i was so happy, that can also be because i talked to david rt after my class, we are really doing well i think after this weekend, things have steadily been getting back on track with us, i really think i am in love with him, i think the whole break up only made us stronger, that happened the first time we sort of broke up, i wish we could just spend all of our time with each other, i really do miss him a lot, and the thing is if we hadn't broken up this summer i wanted to break up with him before we started college because i wanted to date other people, but the truth is i've only been comparing other guys to him, i guess that's what happens, i mean i have seen cute guys but i haven't really met any yet, so i don't know if that's a good ting or not, anyway david wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because i can't really trust him and neither can my parents, so that really sucks because i really do still want to be with him but my mom is like seville your a fool and blah blah and sometimes i feel like i kind of am because i start to doubt myself so much about the decision i'm making about us, its like would i follow my heart or mind? it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that's really how i feel, i think things are looking up and i think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind's ",0
" there is to much traffic in austin. i am ready to see my girlfriend this weekend. i am glad it is almost the weekend. the buses outside are to loud it is annoying. i guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. i'm thirsty i think i will get so water. i like this deja blue container it works good to refill. on yea that nice and cold. i guess i need to study my spanish when i am done with this. i wonder how my parents are doing, i guess i should call them pretty soon. five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. tomorrow is friday horray. i am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. it probaly isn't in the dictionary. there are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. that would suck. i like my bob marley poster it is interesting. i guess i should go work out a little today before work. i'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. that water tastes good. this psychology is kind of interesting but i still don't know what i am going to major in. it really does bug me i wish i could figure it out. oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye i should just have fun. i need a different soap i don't really like this dail. i wish i wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it. it will take forever for me to use it. i wonder whats on tv. it would be kind of hard to watch will i am typing. i want hook up my speakers to my computer, i need to find that damn chord. i need to find someone with a printer for biology homework. what am i going to do when i am done with this i don't know if i really want to study. i guess i have to since i have to work tonight. wow it is eighty degrees in here. i wonder how acurrate that galelio theremometer is. it seems like it would be pretty acurrate. galelio was a smart guy so why not. looks hot outside im glad i don't have to go out there till later. although it still won't be all that cool.

"well, here i go writing a stream of consciousness. i am starving right now. all i have eaten today are cookies and queso with chips. the timer clock at the top of this page is bothering me, i don't know why, but it is distracting me from writing. my boyfriend is going to his ranch tomorrow. i wish he did not go every weekend because it sucks for me to be here without him. the electric bill is so expensive that we received today. i am out of money. well not out, but out of money that i can spend on random stuff. i miss my mom. i hope my grandpa is doing ok, he is very very sick. my eyes hurt. i don't like wearing my glasses. the fan is also irritating them. i am glad that its the weekend. i want a cool front to come through. i am so tired of being hot outside at school. i think i have a obsession with correct spelling. i know that this is supposed to be informal, but i cannot let a misspelled word go uncorrected. capitalization does not bother me, however, nor does some punctuation. i am the same way when i type online to my friends. i wonder if that means anything significant. probably not. i want a dog. i wish i lived in a complex that allowed pets. next year i will get one, hopefully. i want to adopt one from the spca or the pound. they are just as nice as ones from breeders, as well as cheaper, and they need a home more than the others. geez, this timer makes the time seem to go by more slowly. its like that saying my mom always says, 'a watched pot never boils. ' similar at least. i want a good book to read. i hate how i have so much reading homework from my classes that i do not have time to read for pleasure. oh well, maybe i'll find the time once i get more settled in to the routine of school. i need to do laundry. i have no clean clothes to wear, and i dropped grape jelly on my favorite jeans yesterday. i hope that it does not stain. i don't know what to day now. its so weird, i know that the brain never stops working, but if you try to identify your thoughts sometimes you draw a blank. its like you caught your mind off-guard. like when your boyfriend asks you what you're thinking about, and its really only what you had for lunch that day, but he is expecting something more romantic than that because he thinks he is being romantic and sincere by asking the question. so maybe when you have to say immediately what you are thinking at that moment and you don't have an answer, maybe your subconscious is just embarrassed because it was just thinking about something insignificant. ok, that whole little tangent probably made no sense to anybody except myself. oh well. i am tired of typing. my hands are out of shape. how sad. my whole body is out of shape. i hate living on the third floor of my apartment complex. the stairs are killing me. i didn't realize how out of shape i was until i had to move in and carry all my stuff up a million flights of stairs. my chair is too low and i can't figure out how to make it go up higher because there aren't any knobs or levers. its hurting my wrists. well, my right wrist to be specific. i hate it when people have something they want to say and they just don't know how to be direct about it. 'beating around the bush' that is so annoying. just get the words out. mmmm. i am so hungry. i want a burrito. or some queso. or both at the same time. i love mexican food. its good stuff. i would like a margarita too. that would be nice. i hope that i can transfer into the college of communications. that would be awesome. i hope that i succeed in advertising. i think that i would do a good job, but there are so many good and creative people at ut, all wanting to do the same thing as me. i hope that i have a fighting chance. i know that i have the work ethic to do well, but as far as creativity, i am uncertain if i measure up to the industry standard. wow, the time is up. that went by fast.

"well as i was clicking on the button that allows you to begin, i noticed that i forgot the last digit of my social security number, aka, ut eid. well for whoever care, it is 7. my i'd number is 449712047. there now i can get credit for this assignment. anyway, i don't know what to write about. i'm sure that after a while your stream of consciousness"""" i totally spelled that wrong, will take over. i bet everyone writes this at the beginning of their assignment just because they don't know what else to write about and aren't bored enough to be honest yet. so i am really mad about my laptop. last night is just turned white and shut down. i tried turning it on this morning and it wouldn't so i took it to the its or something like that. it is the place where they are supposed to fix your computer. well they didn't. nope they just gave ma 1 8oo number to call which took me 20 minutes and i still didn't talk to a real person. i always type didn't instead of didn't. that is annoying. so i took the battery out of my computer and it works now but i still need a new battery which better be under warranty because i just got the thing in may. so i go to check my e mail and what do you know, i have another freaking virus on my computer. i am about to scream. seriously, i am using my roommates computer right now. it is the second one since i got here in june and it is pissing me off. i mean i am not even one of those internet surfing kids, i just use it for research and e mail and papers and stuff so i don't even know how i got the dang thing. so now i have decided to type with the correct hand position so my typing is considerably slower and my spelling considerably poorer. ya screw this. i wish i would have paid attention in keyboarding class. man, i am only half way done. so this is my roommate's computer. she is sleeping right now. don't get me wrong, i love the girl to death but she is freaking emotional. it was her and her boyfriends 1 year anniversary today. i don't think he is good for her. my arm is starting to hurt. i know why it is because here in jester you have no freaking desk space and the fridge is shoved into your back. in kinsolving it was heaven. i miss it there a lot better community. my professor was talking about freshman insecurity or whatever today. he was right. i don't consider myself to be an insecure person but college will do it to ya, especially when you don't know anyone. i bet there are people like me who can just sit here and type crap, never letting on to what they are really thinking about. i obviously already have a little, but to tell you the truth, i am really thinking about how bad i am at typing. i don't know why i think i have to type fast for this. it isn't like you are counting my words. actually, it is just making it harder for me to continue my bullshit, excuse the french. why do people say that? i think my dog back home is depressed. i know she misses me, i'm the only one she liked. she is always at my neighbor's house because they let her in and feed her. the sad thing is, i think my neighbor is trying to replace her husband with my odg. they just got divorced, one of the super religious couples you would never expect to. she is such a softie anyway. ya i def think that she is using my dog for company. i don't know why though because she already has two dogs of her own. ok well i have this meeting to go to tonight. it is for the lassos, no wait, the lonestars. i can't forget to call my friend lindsay or is it lindsey so we can meet to walk there. ya i am about to nope, i just did sneeze. god bless me. i think everyone should believe in god. he is great even if there is no proof, that is where faith comes in right? right.

"i am beginning to write this assignment and i'm thinking that is a pretty big waste of time. i'm already bored and i don't like it. i can smell the bread i got at la madelines and it smells pretty good. i don't normally eat there so it was a treat and i was there with a good friend so it was pretty fun. my friend'roommate just flushed the toilet and i think it sucks down pretty hard. alright only eighteen minutes to go. the more i smell the bread the more i want to eat it. it smells really good. the tv is on right now and it is on mtv, the voice of our generation. i was watching a show on christina aguilara and realized how gorgeous she really was when she dresses normally. man i'm hungry! i got to say i want to pierce my lip. the more i think about it the more i want to do it. i think it would so cool. and i want a tattoo. too bad my dad is anal about stuff like that. oh well, one of these days. we better beat the hell out of arkansas next saturday or i'll be pissed. my friend made me laugh because he heard this commercial for the dumbest movie ever, malibu's most wanted. i could go for some cereal. my mom's in europe on a cruise right now. queer eye for the straight guy is the dumbest excuse for television ever. what a waste of time that was. they don't even dress like straight guys. they are really gay and there style sucks. jimmy fallon is a funny guy i met him in new york. it is weird how peoples minds drift. i wish i could be a professional assassin. not even a ninja assassin, just one with a cool silenced gun. i don't know why. it just seems cool. to take care"""" of evil men. like in the boondock saints, the greatest movie ever. i hope i get to run track in the spring and i make the team. that would be like a dream come true. i would be a college athlete. that would be neat. and all the ladies love that. i think music is a great thing. i hope i find a bassist for my man while i'm here and we can play a show here at emo's. this is taking a lot longer than i thought it would. beyonce knowles is a good looking' woman. i don't know why she likes jay-z. to be famous would be nice, but to be a doctor would be nicer because i earned that. good charlotte sucks. they are terrible live and i don't get why people like them. the guitarist isn't even good. i'm half way done. that is nice to know. my mind is being strained. the texans one today and they beat the dolphins. that is awesome because some thought the dolphins would win the super bowl. we'll see about that. texas football rules. my old high school one its first game of the season yesterday and they did well. my little brother one his first high school of his career and he was pretty proud. he is on the a team and that is a big deal. blah blah, that is what my mind thinks. its neat to see what people can think of. i need to buy some milk for my room. i could go fro some cocoa-cocoa dyno bytes. they are so good, and chocolaty. mmmmmm. delicious. instant messaging is an interesting concept in these connected times of ours. that would suck to be a worm. have no legs and what not, i need to get xp for my computer so i have word, excell and power point. that would be nice. only six minutes to go. i don't know why people love asses so much. its kinda gross when people think about what they really are. chris rock is pretty find. he just has a really big mouth and i'm surprised he hasn't gotten beaten up. it was jack black's birthday not too long ago and he is really funny. i just started showing my friend how to play the guitar and she is doing pretty well. probably because she knows how to play the violin. david blaine is the most amazing street magician ever. the olsen twins are worth over a billion dollars. rock music is the best sort of music because i can get into it more i think. rap isn't real music. just like good charlotte. i like evanescence because that girl is hot and linkin park is good because they are different. the white stripes suck however because that girl can't drum to save her life. it is interesting to see how people interact. i don't know why. maybe that is why i want to be a psychiatrist. i'm trying to spell correctly on this and i don't know why. maybe so you can understand what is being typed on this crazy assignment. linkin park won the best rock video award. it was interesting. i don't know why. that band has a lot of asians in it. metallica is a well received band because they are good. i could never be a typical rock star because i can't think i could be that mean to people.

i am at work right now but i don't start to work until about 30 more minutes i wonder if any one is going to if anyone is going to ask me what i am doing oh well there is this person that i think is real nice so i cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so i guess ill start to press enter when i cant see the words i am typing i feel like laughing i don't really know why well i do but it would be to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see i wish i could go home i just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. i still like the class though cant wait fort he day to be over. i is supposed to rain today i want it to but i don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard i cant type as quick as my mind thinks i'm not sure i like this computer either well i'm still skipping my thoughts on the next assignment i think i better write it down instead. ok the truth i did erase something from the beginning of this document. i'm at work for goodness sakes. why do i keep putting periods down i guess it is hard to write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok i've got to stop that oh well i didn't know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what i was doing i wish i had more time to write some more poems i will though i really want to perfect the one i wrote about the tanut this i going to look crazy when they print it out. i like this assignment though i never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn't have enough speed to get everything on the net on my computer i rally want to buy some more software for it but i don't know if i can afford it so this guy that i was telling you about is so fine i feel like i want to jump his bones i even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn't even sexual so i wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings i hope my ta gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy i have a boy friend thought it will be five years in november i don't believe it i love him though ok my mind has gone blank i cant think of anything i wish that when i write paper that the information i need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so i could write a complete 12 page paper in one day i guess i would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday i should have been writing my thoughts down i actually because aware became aware of what i was thinking it was kind of weird why to i keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow i bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment i wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if i did know. naked why i don't know so one to the next topic my the way i wasn't taking bout the winston cigarette ads you know i don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until i have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that i do i won't be doing it for the rest of my life though i do know that for sure actually i'm not sure i know what i want to do bye.

"i don't understand how it is i'm supposed to write this thing when i can't even type as fast as i can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think. at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller. i have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right? it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. i hate when people call me smart because i don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really don't. i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them. they were so bluh. i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never i'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. i think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month i had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. i didn't even realize i had talked that much on the thing. now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can i cuss on this thing. i don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree i'm not and early i did say i wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. i wonder if i can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i can't speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it. and i normally understand it too. but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor. i want to be a teacher too but i'm afraid because i'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal i dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. i think i'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem. but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer. i am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. i don't even clean as often as i used to. i just want to be lazy and go out. i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict. i never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which i did. but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. i'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but i'm not about to complain anymore because i'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes. i want to keep writing but i'm supposed to do my pre-cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i don't have.

"hi, i'm sitting here in the computer lab at the fac, and it is dark outside and i'm a young attractive female. . i'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home. home, that's what i call my dorm these days. it's just easier for me. i want to have some established place to live and stuff that way i'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle. i used to laugh at lt when she called her dorm home. i guess i am following in her footsteps. although her strides are quite different from mine. and talking of strides, i miss cross country and all the guys. it was so much fun. i enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it. i wish i could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should. what went up came down and so on. i wish i could just see the fruit of my hard work as i did in cross country. the family atmosphere that i ridiculed and even took for granted at times. how could i have been so? i who loves others, i who cherishes all my friends. they were all my friends, all 23 of them. some more than others, but we all had that common goal that i find characterizes friendships. we were a sister hood. gosh, what a mourner i am, lamenting over the past. but they were good times. i'm sure, and i hope to god that i'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come. but this i can only hope that god gives me. for who knows tomorrow may never be. perhaps this is all i have. i'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet. i don't think i've done what i was purposed to do. therefore i'm not ready to go yet. in fact,,, i don't even know what it is that i was purposed to do. perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that i should be doing that i was purposed to do. who knows? who cares but me and my maker? anyway, i guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it. i guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do. i don't think planning is such a great idea. i don't think mlk planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college. i guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader. or so i guess. and whatever it is that i'll need to do will find me and use me for what i am worth. when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution. but it cannot be. mankind is not a prostitute race. or is it. i don't know. sometimes i think it is . other times i think it is a dignified race. but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration. too much more than it deserves. mankind is a fallen race. lower than the angles -which we should have been higher than. but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of god with the ability to tap into the supernatural'the unknown unlike any other creature. there is no intelligent life in other planets, we are it. now, i don't mean to say there is no other life forms out there, but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind. but then again what do i know? i who was born only 18 years ago? i don't know much, but then again, i have know a lot more than i credit myself. i have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry. there are things, great mysteries, that i knew even before i was born. but how is this?. oops my 20 minutes are up and that popup really disrupted my stream of consciousness!!!! what an ass!

"my feet really hurt. i wish i would have made that dance team. if that stupid bitch lina had made it, i wouldn't feel so bad. i have always hated her. she is a stupid fat whore who i hope does not succeed in life and ends up as fat as her mother. having an abortion and then denying it, what a lying sack. i hate people like that. i want my computer to work all the time. i am so sick of it being messed up all the time. tracy dropped psychology. damn. i was hoping we could get to know each other by studying together and going to class together. that would be really nice. i need to meet more people here. i like hanging out with all my old friends, but i need to meet some more. those dance girls were all airheads though. maybe it is a good thing that i didn't make it. i would have to around all hose goof ball people all the time. that would kind of suck. man, i wish i could loose some weight. i am not going to if i keep eating all this shitty dorm food. with as much as i work out, i should be loosing weight. why not. mark wants to loose weight just as much as i do, but i guess it is just as hard for guys to loose weight as it is for girls. whatever. i am already tired of this assignment. i guess it is better that having some tight ass paper to write. my rhetoric response paper sucked. i hope i get a good grade on it though. i have to make good grades this year. i will die if i don't. i want to, and my parents will kill me if i don't. not enough time for sex though. i guess when you first start having sex you want to do it all the time. too bad mark doesn't want to. i wish he was just a little bit more of a horn ball. what a weird thing to say. i girl wanting a guy to be a little bit more horny. isn't it supposed to be the other way around? whatever. i really want to have sex now. look what i d id to myself. that girl on the south mall was really weird. there are no hot guys in any of my classes. well at least that i can see. i can't see anyone in my huge ass classes 200540 people. what bullshit! this is such a huge school. it's ridiculous. my hands hurt because i am typing so fast and so much. whatever. need to pop my knuckles. there. i can't believe that ken reynolds died that is crazy 42 years old. that really scares me. if matt calls in the middle of the night one more time, i think i am going to throw the computer at the wall. i love this song """"falling from grace"""" it is awesome. it makes me think of a movie. i'm not sure which one though. maybe some drug movie or something. all that reading i have to do. college is way harder than i am wanting right now. i need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. i think tomorrow after mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. i don't know. we always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. i am so excited about the football game. i get to sit with who. let's see. lindsey, mark, and ian, is that it? i can't even remember. oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. man my neck hurts. i need another massage. that felt so good. i can't believe that lindsey has natalie in her rhetoric class. i hope i get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. i need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. this is really not that bad of an assignment. i can handle it pretty well. i wonder who is on the phone. it must be ian. what a weird kid. he is cool though. i am glad to have him as a friend. i wish wes would be a little more open when i try to talk to him. he is nice and i think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. then we are like old friends. who knows about that boy. he has a complex mind. it was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. i'd be his for sure. he was drunk when he said that though. i hope he meant. most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. i don't, but i know some people do. i just want to have some new friends. i think i am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time i see her, we talk for a while. today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. all the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. that sounds like fun. i kind of wish i was in a sorority, but i guess i will live. oh well. there's twenty minutes.

"my life is an out of control freight train. i know not where i am going or how i am going to get there. throw a match upon me and i could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. but for what reason do you do this? i hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that i pass the question. why am i all of the sudden asking myself why? i know where i came from but does this mean i cannot know where i am going? on i travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. this gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. this is why i am grateful that i do not have to face the world alone. my life is full of love and hope. my hopes of myself are to touch some person the way i have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. this ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and i can see through your blurry sight. and i can see through you! your rules mean nothing to me and mine. i live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. i draw so much upon my music that i sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. my life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings.

"college is awesome though, there is no doubt about that, but it is a little hard to handle well, but sick is an even bigger challenge. i never knew how fun college could actually be, it is crazy. there are so many new people to meet and make friends with, some are nice some not, but hey that is always how it goes. i grew up in austin so finding my way around campus is really no big deal for me. it actually is really nice, because i know my way around the entire city, and plus my parents are here just in case i really need them. plus the fact that it is easier for me to get money that it is for most people. another bonus about having grown up in austin is the fact that i don't have to change my doctor or anything like that, which came in very handy this week, with me being sick and all. the one thing that bothers me the most about college is the pressure to fit in. i'm in a sorority and absolutely love it, but what i don't love is the fact that when we go to parties, every guy there tries to hand you a beer, and for someone who normally doesn't drink it can get kind of annoying. but even worse is the fact that i start to feel like there is something wrong with me because i am not drinking. like i should be and because i'm not that i am just the weird girl. it is hard for me because i don't want to compromise my moral and religious beliefs, but i continue to find it harder and harder to say no when someone asks me if i want something to drink. it is a very weird and torn feeling, and when i do drink i feel really guilty about it. the one thing that i don't understand is why people think that they need to drink in order to have a good time. after all, most of the time they don't even remember to good time that they had. i myself know that i am having just as much fun as everyone else when i am sober. i am continuing to struggle with this subject daily. i am out of the comfort zone of my high school friends. friends who believed the same things that i did and that didn't feel like they had to drink to have a good time. i miss them so much, even though i am making new friends here, i still wish that i could see my old friends every day, because just by looking at the expression on my face they can tell when i need a hug because i'm having a bad day or that i just need someone to talk to. it takes a while to form deep relationships with people because no one wants to open up right away and let themselves be vulnerable, they are afraid that if they do it will come back to haunt them, i'm guilty of the same things. it is just going to take time to make really good, deep friendships here at college, but i think that i am on my way. i often wonder if other people are feeling the exact same way that i am. if they are nervous, timid and scared. i guess that is really stupid to ask because i know that they are. i find it so strange how life takes turns that you never would have expected. it is never predictable and never quite goes the way that you have planned it to go. when i first applied for college i swore that i was going to go out of state, but low and behold i changed my mind and here i am at the university of texas. god himself is just incredible, especially when he throws little things into your life, weather it is for the good or the bad you know that it is in his plan. if you ever really stop to think about what would have happened if you didn't meet one person, how many other of your friends would you have never met. i just don't understand how people can think that there is not a higher power looking over us, because from where is sit today, everything that has happened in my life, and the people that i have met, i know are more than mere coincidence, much much more.

"i have a campbell's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder (a tribute to andy warhol) and i am watching it now. my desk is a bit cluttered. purses, markers, papers with assignments that need to be done, a dr pepper can. i am unsure what to write. i began a painting today, and did not finish it. my dorm doesn't feel as though it's a creative environment, but i suppose the dorm won't change. so either i have to change my perspective, or not paint at all. my eyes are heavy, and i am cold, because my hair is wet and squeaky clean. my hands are warmer than usual (they are usually as cold as ice, or very near as such), and i shall have to remember to tell my mother, because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating. it is ten to midnight. my mind is active, but i lack in motivation. i am excited about this new life i have, as a college freshman, but i am also extremely nervous. i must do as well as possible this year, so that i won't have to return back home to a run-of-the-mill local college (as my dad has threatened if i don't succeed in producing a pretty-looking gpa), and also my future as an architect (the career which i would like to pursue) is depended solely upon my performance this year. i did not get into the architecture program this year, and should like to transfer in as a sophomore. i have run out of things to discuss. i miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home. i had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that i have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat. i brought only the bare minimum of books with me, my art books, of course, and my absolute fave novels, one of them being a wrinkle in time. i am fully aware that it is a young adult novel, and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite, but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless. my room smells of the body wash i use (energizing citrus, i love it) and stale mr. gatti's pizza. there is a faint tinge of acrylic-paint smell. my roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit. my bed is full of pillows, two black hearts and a red furry one, and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me. i am, for once, not hungry. but merely satiated, as i feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger. i have less than seven minutes to go! i wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo. in what way do you benefit from reading this? i can't imagine how anything could come of this, except perhaps extreme boredom, or maybe resentment. there is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend's subdivision in georgetown, holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such, and every time we drive by her, i think: that has got to be by far the worst job in the world. she stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on, holding a bent sign and a jug of water. and i can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is: i am a pole. """" yes, ladies and gentlemen, with one simple gesture, a stick could be stuck in the ground, and the sign pasted onto it, and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job, and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up, and it just kills me. and i am glad i am not her. i am glad i am not a whole bunch of people. the end.

"well, since i don't know how to start, i'll start by talking about my weekend. i just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. we started saturday. buck, carl, dylan, kevin, crystal, and i went to lake georgetown with my new boat. i made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. i actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. the only problem is that it hurts when you fall. i broke my nose the first time that i fell because i kneed myself in the face. i spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. the only problem with saturday is that crystal and carl got into a fight. they've been dating for a couple of weeks now. anyway, we went back to the lake sunday and i kept trying different things and now i'm pretty good on one ski. and it is a blast, i'll never go back to two skis. sunday night i played the role of mediator for everyone. i talked to crystal about carl and i talked to carl about crystal. they are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. then i talked to danielle about buck. danielle is one of crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. she liked buck a lot. buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. this is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. at least as far as i can tell. but i did a lot of talking and more importantly listening sunday. i think i helped smooth everything over with them for now. carl and crystal seem to be getting along better. i missed classes monday because of injuries that i received over the weekend. i broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. i couldn't even get out of bed monday morning. i'm starting to recover though. i had to go to work tuesday. i work at internet gateway in georgetown. i love working there except that i don't get paid near what i should be getting. i make $9'hr. that should be 23 times more, but i only work 2 days a week anyway. i was working full time but i decided that since i have to go to school, i should make it my top priority. i didn't want to go to college, i'm not sure that i want to now that i'm going; but i know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. that's really the only reason i'm going is because my mom wanted me to. actually my whole family was pushing me to go. this is ok though because i know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. especially when i start looking for a better paying job. although, college has been really fun so far. i have had my own house since this summer. buck and i are roommates and we are renting a house in georgetown. it is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that i have my own place. buck and i met at work. his dad owns the company where i am employed and he started working there during the spring. we have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. he is a good guy. we have a lot in common too. i've been lucky in that regard. i have a lot of good friends, and several that i can depend on for anything. it is a really good feeling to know that i can trust someone like buck with my life. i've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. my stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. well, i've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and i have to go back to work now.

"why am i being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how i feel and know it to be. because i have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that i am mistaken, but i do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this i know. what to do about it? i don't. these negative things come to mind whenever i am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. i have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of """"natural"""" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. i don't appreciated being forced to submit and i emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. i could and do this often on my own time. but i am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? i don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. i have few things of value in this world, but i do have my mind and my intellectual property. i do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a phd. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a """"serious"""" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, i suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? i don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if i don't think in language? what if i think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how i think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. i suppose i should say that i've never met a psych major that i liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, i suppose i am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, i have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. i will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, english major. i have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. i suppose i should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell i want to do this all over again. oh look time is up. i guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer.

i am in this big state of confusion. everything toward school work right now is going easy but all my feelings for my friends and my boyfriend are burning inside of me. i feel as if my classes are going to turn right around on me and kick me in the butt. i don't know if i should stress out about them or later. carlos is starting to act like a jerk. i hope he hasn't found someone else. i broke up with him last night because of the way he has been treating me. i regret it but i feel as if i did the right thing. i am so confused! eventually i will get back with him. boy do i miss him. my legs are very sore from lifting weights yesterday i hope that my legs get in shape. i really want to lose weight. i feel very fat sometimes. well my cousin danny is coming down from the army this weekend. should i go home to see him or stay here? i know if i go home i will probably call carlos and we will probably call carlos and we will get back. i guess my cousin going home can be an excuse for me to go down and talk to carlos. another reason to go down home is for melanie's license plates. again that is another excuse. lately melanie has been on the phone all the time making me mad because i want to use the phone also. g-whiz my legs are hurting. i really need to find a job here around campus. i want to work in the library but hopefully there won't be any hassles. jason my neighbor is crazy. him and his girlfriend are really cute together. why can't carlos and i be like them. both jason and irene love to work out. whenever i go i go with them. well actually i have been going everyday with them. i need money!! this show that is on is weird. i have listening to it while i am writing. it is making me sad. well i better go my time is up. ,0
"it is now 12:32 and so i cannot wait until 12:52 because at that time my writing will be done. i type slowly anyway so i shouldn't have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. i am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact i am hungry and stressed out. the first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. i am in college and at this point i need to get my priorities straight. i am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. my mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. i need a job, but i'm so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. i am not the proudest to be in a sorority. don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but i don't like the whole association that comes with it. my whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. in fact, i like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me? i love austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between smu and here. there are so many interesting people and i want to get to know them all or at least try. wow, it's already been over 10 minutes and this has not been too hard. i used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven't had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why i have been able to do this, and express myself so well. i enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why i write so much-journal, letters, poems. it helps me gain a sense of relief and since i don' express my feelings out loud too often, i need to do this daily, if not more so i can release all that i feel. i am excited about doing psychology this year because i hope to decide between the two majors i am struggling with. i am at the moment down for premed'nutrition and i really do want to go into medicine, but i've also always been interested in criminal psychology. it may be a little depressing, but i find it very interesting, and definitely want a job i love. a few months back, i read helter skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so i am hoping this class will help with my decision making. i guess we'll see. it is 12:51 now and time for me to stop.

"well, i don't really know what i am suppose to be doing, so i'll just do the best that i can. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind right now. i feel nervous, yet excited to find what college life has yet to bring me. i feel that i need to manage my time more, because i am so scared that everything is going to catch up with me. all weekend i've said that i need to do something, but just can't seem to figure out what i should do. i talk to my mom everyday, and it makes me really sad. everyday i think of my family and how much i miss them. we are so close and my nieces and nephews mean the world to me, and everytime i talk to them on the phone it makes me cry. i even felt like just leaving, but i know that i have to stay here in order to succeed. my boyfriend doesn't really help out much in making me feel better. he just doesn't understand how it feels to actually miss family. he gets so mad at me just because i call her and he says by me doing that it doesn't make things any better. it's just that she is so sad because i am not there and she's all alone. she thinks that i won't ever come home again, and i know that's not true. i just wish there was a way for me to let her know that. she thinks that just because i left i won't ever see her again. i know that i will never move back home after i graduate, but it will always be home, and i know i will visit her. i also feel so pressured, in soo many ways. i just worry that i won't make it here. i just want it to all end soon. i want to finish school as quickly as possible, because i feel that i need to begin my life. i mean not begin my life, but actually start my own. i need to get out and see the real world on my own perspective. my mom has held this shield over me my whole life, so being here has opened my eyes a whole lot. i've learned so much, but know that i have so much more to see. i really wish i could experience more things though. i mean having a boyfriend holds me back a lot. i haven't gotten to experience all the things that i should. sorry i don't know if this is going to work, but i realized i didn't put in my social or name. 462898153- virginia moreno ",1
" i am excited about being a columnist, not because i like the daily texan particularly, although i do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since i can go on to write for the dmn or the statesman once i am out of college and i can get internships at newspapers during the summer so it will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, i'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, i don't know if i can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, i don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but i obviously can't leave them behind and i think i want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean i actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but i still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but i can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all i can do is leave my options open so i can make good decisions later, so basically all i can do is write as well as i can and make good grades, i don't know exactly how to do either but i do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means i need to go to the utlc finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well i can do on my own, i'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, i'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as i love going to ut home games, an away game means that i can eat while i'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, i can watch it with whoever i want and i don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, i would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, i don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so i don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, i'm a little worried about what i look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot i can do about that before the next game but i'll do what i can, i'm bored with classes already, i havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since i am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so i can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more i do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, i've never lived by myself before and i havent lived away from home for that long, i've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since i don't live in a dorm anymore, i miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so i guess the solution to that is to get things done while i'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, i need to get some groceries, i don't think i know how to shop yet, i still havent made a grocery list longer than 12 items and that's not enough when i go to the store once a week at most, i'm sure things will get easier once i get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but i'm anxious to get to the point where i am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management ",0
" i am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, i'm still going to think as i write this intro. you see, it's my birthday today, and so i could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. i'm taking a girl i like to a party tonight - i guess that might be more interesting. or maybe i should just talk about how my parents really piss me off. since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. but before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. they would bitch about anything, seriously. i mean, i had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. my friend jackson once told me i should get in a lot of trouble. then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. for some reason i never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. but, he was right. when they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year. okay, new topic. when i was over at my friend alex's house one day, this kid pulls out alex's . 22 rifle. i'm like, dude, don't point that at me, turn it away. he listens, and he starts pointing it at alex. alex is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. this kid is pointing the rifle at alex, making shooting noises, while alex is playing a nintendo game. for some reason, i had a really bad feeling. this was not a toy - it was a gun. pop! all of a sudden it went off. the thing was, the kid was at such close range, alex couldn't even feel the blast. i had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. i ran to call the ambulance, and i think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), i've never liked guns. my phone's ringing right now, but i'm not going to pick it up since i'm doing this assignment. you know, i bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. that's so boring. i like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. i'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. but thanks for listening and i'll catch you on the flip side.

"ah! 8secs! o no 16 sec! er. er. what am i supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi shawn! er. talking to shawn. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. ah! 2min 17 sec! hang up shawn! hang up! eeek. panicking! talking about tomorrow's chem exam. man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when shawn called to remind me. hm. i should start studying right after i finish this. i got to get more organized and responsible. i wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, i watched what women want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. i wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. i would like that power, i can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. i think it's called kare kano or something like that. reminds me of fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe i should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. i miss something. i don't know what. i should call an-vi earlier today, i think she was kind of disappointed that i didn't call her the other day. i wonder how college is like for her in utsa, she says it is nice and all, but i bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am i talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. i wonder. don't know what i'm wondering, juliet's thoughts were much better i think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? i don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. i miss hugging her. i feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in ut austin, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in ut. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: i would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, i would like to spike it like goku but not as short as most guys nowadays. 14 min. i wonder how much i've written, i should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. i've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, the hills are a live with the sound of music!"""" heh, don't know why i just thought of that, 15 min. hm. :looking at finish button: i wonder if i'll be able to print this out. i feel like i'm not thinking deep enough, i wonder why. should i go back this week or no? i want to because my parents probably miss me, and i want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, i'm not really thinking any of this i think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. i don't know, i can't explain it. i can't sleep well. never could. wish i could. then i could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by aya matsuura. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, i wonder if i can ever become really important, eh, i think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 55 sec left. i feel like i should type something more meaningful, i've pressed backspace a lot. i wonder how my sister is. i want to go to a party. and meet more people. i wonder how daniel is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. juliet is cool, she likes some things that i didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. i've coincidently met people i've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like grace and lila and some other friends. i think i'm getting better at talking. i want to get smarter. i feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. i like to dream. i'm ambitious. is that bad or good? i have no idea.

"i'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring, i wish i had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe if i turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. i don't know how i'm going to be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. i can't help but stare at the posters to kill time. i'm particularly fond the print of monet's sunset at venice. there are so many things i'd rather be doing right now, like watching tv or sleeping. well i'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 6 minutes has lapsed. i wonder just how many of these the professor'ta's actually read. i know i wouldn't want to have to read any of these. hopefully i did well on my biology test i took today. tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. i still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which i will more than likely put off until sunday. only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. i thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. i can hear people talking out side. normally i would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. i wish i had a laptop so that i could type this elsewhere, and i think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. i wish i could go to the game saturday, but i didn't get a ticket. last week's game was really exciting. only one more minute. i just wish this were over with. i can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. i can hear music playing in the next room. i wish my stereo system was that loud.

"i have a headache i took some excederine a few minutes ago i am tired. after four days off i was out of the habit of going to school. i feels good to be home. this assignment is odd. i am full. my head is hurting again with a dull pain this time. tuesday night, nothing good comes on tv i have to watch satellite shows. some people did this assignment in the first day of class. i guess it is hard to find anything to do when you move away from home i am glad i decided to live at home, but i am afraid i am missing out on meeting new friends. sometines i feel like an outsider on campus. but i wouldn't have made friends easily either. i would just sit around, study and be bored. i wish i was more outgoing. i want to speak to people and make new friends but it is one of the hardest things to do speaking to strangers. i want to but my own inhibition stops me. it is funny how you can want very badly to do something but someting inside you stops you from doing it this is really helping my typing. like in high school typing class high school was generally a good time i had trouble meeting people there also. i was time to graduate, more would have been ridiculus. i waited until people would make an effort to meet me rather than be proactive i should approach people myself like i intended to do today but couldnt ut is a big place i have a lot of concerns i like chemistry and welch hall but i am a business major business majors earn more money i want to buy a house and a new car on my own break away rom my parents but i am not ready to leave home. starting high school depressed me i am afraid i will hate business i think god's plan was for me to be a scientist but i am taking all the wrong courses common sense tellw me to major in business but my gut feeling is science there are no easy answers i can be a judge, which is cool i don't think i think fast enough on my feet to be a lawyer drafting documents i can do a masters in business would provide as many opportunities a law school but with law i get a license and a doctors degree. is prestige that important. sometimes lawyers carry a stigma i don't want to seem overeducated to work in business, but its now or never. it is too hard to decide what to do in life i am afraid i am making all the wrong decisions. time is up i like this assigment ",0
"it's 6:48. i think i'll type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top. as i sit here, looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard, i wonder what my girlfriend is doing since i am using her computer. can't wait till monday! i finally get my own internet set up at my apartment. i feel like i'm getting sick. i was sneezing a lot the other day, now i have a slight sore throat. i wonder what the purpose of this assignment is. is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work? gah! i hate this runny nose! my girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me. a little too many? hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now. i need to find more time to go to the gym now. going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isn't that good, right? wow. i feel like my ex-roommate. all he ever did was study, go to the gym, and hang out with his girlfriend, too. i wonder what i'll do for dinner tonight. i should eat healthier. learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help. i hope i'm doing this assignment correctly. oh well, if i'm not, i can just ask a ta just to make sure. it's only been 6 min and 15 sec? wow, this is going to be longer than i thought. oh look, it's bloat (a toy from mcdonalds that was in the movie finding nemo). what a great movie that was. best children's movie i've seen in a long time. i'm feeling more ill now. this can't be good. maybe i shouldn't go out tonight. ugh, that's right- i won't be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over. oh well, i've been spending a lot of time with her recently; it's understandable. i need to find some tissues. there's a roll of paper towels and toilet paper. i think i'll grab some toilet paper. hahaha- it's just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes; the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper. *sigh* i miss those good old simple days. a lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then. it was good to be young. i know what i'd like to do right now! i want to play counter-strike! too bad i can't install it onto her computer. i wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she"""" is. should be obvious, so no worries. what homework'reading assignments do i need to take care of this weekend. hmm, i'm taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now, i still need to do that one experiment (which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and i can't go any further!), leb, fin?, maybe a little cms reading? i think that should take care of it. oh wait- got to do the eco self-homework tomorrow. look, she is back! aw, she is tired from working out. what?! she just told me how """"everyone"""" has commented on my latest pictures on her board! apparently, people think it's a good picture of me. i guess it is. i actually like those pictures of me (which is kind of rare). i wonder if i can type like i do when i'm online- grammatically incorrect! that would speed up my typing. look! i'm at 19 minutes now! 19 is a great number. all done now!

"well, i guess this is the first time that i have ever done anything like this. i mean, the first time that i have talked about anything to anyone. what i'm really thinking about right now is index cards. i need to make flash cards for my introduction to medical and scientific terminology class, and i don't have any index cards. i feel like i need to complete that task now. why is it that i must always do everything in one day? i just can't ever seem to take my time and relax. i guess if i had any form of ocd, that would be it; i'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule. now, if i wait until this stream of consciousness writing is over, it'll be like almost eleven thirty at night before i'm done. should i really go out and get my index cards then? i need like a pack of 200 of them, but i really need more for the future. i guess i could wait to get more index cards when i get home to houston this weekend, then i would know exactly where to buy them, or i could even get my mom to get them for me in houston, that would be very convenient for me. i miss my mom most. she does everything for me. its not that i miss her just because she did everything for me; its just that she is this really great person. she is so genuine. i know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy. why can't i meet more people like that in my life? i hope i marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can. man, i miss my dog, too. i guess i am a little obsessed with my dog, but i can't help it. she is so cute. and she is been there ever since i was like 12. we're inseparable, and i wonder and worry about how she is doing without me. dogs are great aren't they? they never get angry at you or make you upset. they always are loyal, and give love one hundred percent. i wish that people could be as nice as dogs are. i wish my boyfriend would be happier. he is the main reason why i worry so much of the time. i really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen, until i met him. i worry a lot about him, not about our relationship, but about him. i wish he would be happier, treat himself better, love himself more, and feed himself. the man's the pickiest man i have ever met! i have never made one thing that he thought was yummy. i have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good. everything is always decent. """" decent? i know he doesn't mean to be condescending in any way, but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending. i know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, i don't know if he will ever feel that. that's one thing about psychology. my boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when i try to give it to him. i believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything i do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. his mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. it's all in the mind. if he told himself to like it, he would; but the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. all right, i'm going to shut up about him all ready. i think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. it's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show """"sex and the city,"""" except that these thoughts are really not very private because i guess professor pennebaker or one of the ta's is going to read it, but i'm really okay with one of them reading it. it's not like i have anything really vulgar or nasty to say. i'm so full. i don't think i should have eaten all that kraft macaronni and cheese, but hey, on the bright side, its a great source of calcium, which is something that growing women need, so i guess its kind of a good thing. hahaha. i can't believe that i just tried to justify overeating, at least i don't have to worry about getting fat over it. nobody in my family is fat or even chubby. i don't think i've gained any weight here because i do so much walking, so who cares if i ate extra macaroni; i used skim milk instead of whole milk, and i added salt to it instead of butter, thus i feel no guilt. dude, i could really go for a coke right now. coca cola is so good. its so expensive though, and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys. what makes it taste so good? i think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it; not like that nasty gross diet cola. diet cola is disgusting. i don't understand why people drink diet when there's real cola. i'm sleepy. i don't sleep much here in austin, because all i do is go to school, and then i come home, eat, and then do homework for the whole rest of the time. it's a bitch. i need my sleep man. i don't get more than 5 hours of sleep at most. i had four freaking classes today! can you believe that? from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon, i had class. and get this, what really made today bad was that while i was waiting for the bus, a huge, green, black striped, spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face! i thought i was going to die! i hate spiders! if i had any kind of phobia, its spiders. i don't like any bugs, but spiders are the worst. they're so ugly and creepy and scary. i thought i was really going to cry. it made me so anxious and nervous. i went home and showered. my writing assignment is almost over now. i feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time, how pathetic. hahaha. i'm kinda sad because i like writing all my thoughts down, but i'm relieved because i have a lot of other stuff to do still.

"so i'm sitting here typing about whatever is on my mind. well, a whole lot is on my mind right now, like what the hell am i supposed to do about my car. good lord, that's all i needed, my care to really mess up on me. but anyway, right now, i'm really missing my girlfriend. she is all that consumes my thoughts, so a random progression of my subconscious thoughts will most likely be all about her. i really know how much she means to me now that i went back home to see her. enough about liz. thinking consciously about her will just make me very sad. i was thinking about acid the other day, you know, lsd. i was told that lewis carroll, author of """"alice in wonderland"""", was having one hell of a trip when he wrote the book. that would explain some of the messed up things that he wrote about, but i think that if he had tapped into his own subconscious, he would have been able to write about the same stuff. i mean, lsd allows you to see things that you normally would not see on your own, but i think that deep within your own consciousness, that is what you would really see. for example, i have a friend that said that the ceiling looked like it was dripping, due to all of the little bumps on it from paint. if you look at a ceiling like that long enough, with a clear head, i believe that you would see the exact same thing. i guess that the only reason this kind of pisses me off is that there are so many people that believe that really messed up art, music, and literature can only be created by some one who is having one really wicked trip or who is on some drug or stimulant of some kind. that is complete bs because when i write, or draw, or create music that's really screwed up, i tend to always do it in a clear frame of mind. it really makes me mad that some people believe art comes from being fucked up when all the time it comes from the heart (where it should come from) or the inner recesses of one's mind. i don't want people to think that all the art i create comes from drug abuse when it really comes from my own tormented mind. the absence of the love of your life can lead to some really messed up art. i've written some of the most depressing work i've ever written lately because of that absence. if it were humanly possible, financially etc. , i would marry that girl in a heartbeat because i think the only way for me to be completely happy is to be with her. the drumming in my head is beginning to start. how quaint for the artistic flow to arrive just as i am planning to leave the site. the drumming will continue the rest of my evening.

"i am feeling kind of nervous today because i only have one class and i am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. i also wonder why i have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges? in any event i know that i have to go over there and it will not be fun. i am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time i have physically seen them since i moved down here. also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit ut and i am excited that i will be able to see her. people told me that i would be overwhelmed when i came down here but i haven't felt that way yet. things are getting harder by the week, but i think i am handling it well. my room is a mess and i really need to clean it up and do the laundry. i guess i will today since i will have maybe a little free time.

"i cannot believe that i am actually writing and doing my assignment on a saturday. i am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying to talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and i got nowhere with my friend. i feel so bad for my friend, jimmy. he is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. i feel like i should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. i guess that i should talk about myself and not about other people, but i am just so worried about him. i have been so extremely busy today. i woke up at 7 this morning. and i had to go to a basic meeting, which i am very involved in. i just happened to be 2 minutes late, and now i have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next friday. i guess i don't mind if i do it to learn not to be late anymore. then i had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. i didn't want to go, but i felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. i am glad that i went because they are my family and they helped to support me when i needed them most. actually, my friend jimmy, which i just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when i asked him to help me move b'c he had a truck. i asked way in advance, and i called him the night before, and i even told him that he could back out and i wouldn't even mind. he actually said to my face i don't want to do it when i had driven all the way from houston to austin. i couldn't believe that he had said that! i was so mad! i mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. i got prideful, and i said that i would take care of it myself. then i realized my pridefulness, and i prayed to god to break me down. he definitely showed me how i need to be more patient these days. i then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. our mutual friend had before, but jimmy somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. i don't know. i then thought about and then prayed some more, and then i realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. i went to california on vacation, and i had bought him a key chain b'c i knew how stressed he was. i put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. the fact was that if i wasn't living by myself, then i could have gotten more help. and if he said that he was too busy, i would have understood, but he said that he could. everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. but he is so depressed and distraught and etc. i wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. i know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. i just don't understand why he is acting this way. i also have a feeling that he likes this girl who was an old roommate. everyone knows. for some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. i hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. she doesn't happen to know, and i don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. i just hope that everyone gets better.

" i always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that i am asked to write about them, i can't. i wonder where the printers are. its already 7:40. its so quiet in here. i wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print. it looks like she's buisy. this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press. i shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie. its so dull in here. its already getting dark. i hope i'm spelling okay. i can't wait until tomorrow. """"and i love you, and its more then i ever knew. """" (i'm singing in my head). its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing. i'm so glad i learned to type. i hope i can download my calculus homework on this computer. i hope i understand it. this weekend i go home. but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend. he's great. and i love him more everyday. i hope this feeling lasts. i would love to marry him, in like 6 years. he's great and we're great together, i miss him. i just saw him yesterday but i miss him. i'm hungry. i think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate. i wonder what i'm going to eat today. i had a sandwhich yesterday. i should eat something hot. hmm. i guess i could have chicken strips. or vegetables. oo, and a salad. is that how you spell oo. oh, eww, uh, oo. ? oh well. now its 7:48. i wonder if i need glasses? this watch is bothering me. ah, there. my foot hurts so much. i wonder when the swelling will go down. i should email my dad. i hope my string doesn't come off. i forgot to put my rings back on. i hope i don't lose them. tomorrow i have an easy day, and i get to see fili. yah. yeh. ya. whatever. my head hurts. i should eat. what did i eat today. cereal. soup. hmm. i should eat dinner after this. i have so much reading to do. but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend. wow, my time is almost up. i hope i'm doing this right. hmm. i think so. i wish i could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and i don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, i need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. i don't think cell phones are allowed in here. i need to write a letter to danny. i wonder if hanna plays this weekend. i know they do. but where? hmm i need to find out, but soon. i wonder if i should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. i don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. i don't see any printers. hmm. i should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. i need to read. i wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question.

"well, first i'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment i have ever been given. i'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom i'm very in love with, but i really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. my roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and i really wish i was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but i guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. which is what i am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that i have to do! i think that if i can just do that then i will be able to keep with all of my work and get grades in my classes that i will approve. i also need to get into the college of communications so therefore i have to keep my grades up. i really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, i'm very excited about that. also, god willing i really do think it would be awesome to go to the university of iowa for their graduate program in speech pathology. they have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if i'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus! ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and i'm sure whoever reads this is going think that i am a weirdo, but i really don't have much else to talk about. hmmm. i am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family! i think we will have a lot of fun and i'm excited that i get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. i'm having loss of words at the moment. and someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on! ok i did. lets get back on track here. i'm curious as to who gets to read these because i bet that would be a lot of fun. i'm sure that there are lots of different things said on each persons assignment. gosh only 8 minutes of typing! is this ever going to end! (hey i'm being honesty here!) i bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than i am, but i really am typing my thoughts and feelings. actually i'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making no sense at all. i think that sitting here and typing out what i'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what i would really be thinking about, because i'm trying to find something to think about that i can type about. wow that was a confusing sentence. i'm surprised at how much fun i'm having here. i honestly thought that i would become homesick and miss everything back home and i also thought i would miss ryan a lot more than i am. i mean i do miss him, yes! but there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things. not complaining because i'm glad i'm not sitting around moping about him, i need to enjoy life, especially college life! i really can't wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls. the girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you, but i'm sure if i was a guy i probably would not mind. sitting here wondering what i'm going to type next. i'm not supposed to be planning anything out, which i'm not, but sometimes i just don't think about anything. i don't always have to have something on my mind do i? much less a feeling"""". feelings are sometimes so over-rated. simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. well i just re-read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought, so i had to type it. ok 5 more minutes to go, i'm almost there! gee i didn't realize how often i just don't think about stuff, but i usually do think a lot about different things, i guess just not now. i consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker, and have more mature thoughts than other people that i know. take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm """"yeah theta!"""". very loud, annoying, and obnoxious. yes these are the people i am living with, sweet girls but nothing like me. i don't get into all the sorority stuff. times running out. whoo hoo! now i can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment. which is, i must say the easiest graded assignment i have ever done! so i think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this. good idea huh? now i can think about is how i want this to end. i have about a minute to go. so i will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and i hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and """"feelings"""" for 20 minutes of my life. sorry if i bored you, which i probably did. but its ok, i'm really not a boring person! well have a good day and goodbye!

"looking at this assignment i'm trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that i want a good grade. like every other student, i don't like doing homework but i writing so it is okay. i have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend. i know i should have done this earlier but i am a procrastinator and i often wait until the last minute. i am slowly changing that habit because i know i can't procrastinate if i want to do good in school. my feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because i don't know what i am suppose to be feeling. i am just writing what comes to my mind. honestly i don't even understand the topic. all i know is that i'm suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind. i know this has nothing to do with school but i keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston. i was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldn't let her come up to austin. it is okay because i know i'll see her next weekend. i was going to write this earlier like on friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so i didn't find time to write this assignment. so far i like the class because it is the only one that interests me. all my other classes are boring. the is the only class that i enjoy the lectures in. i'm not saying this just to make the professor happy. i'm saying this because i mean it. i am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now. oh yeah, i think the experiments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade. i thought about writing the research papper because i think that might be easier but i think the experiments would be funner. i have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice. i also met some of my friends that i already knew who came here from houston just like me. i have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it i am. i don't know how long i have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind. i thought i would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that i am not. i just keep writing until i don't know what else to write. well things are starting to stop coming into my mind. all i am thinking about is how i can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop. will i think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting, anxious, lost, suprise, and not understanding. this has been a interesting paper because i have no idea what i have been writing. well i guess ill push the submit button now.

" the library is so boring. i can't stand more than two hours of library a day. daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. it is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. there are too many distractions and i believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. time is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, i divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that i have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. i wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, i mean location of the computer, i have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. i have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance i may be watched. i am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. it is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother ",0
"right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes. but i'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet. ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things i don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. i think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad i think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. he's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. i'm going to be so behind in economics. i tell you. i really like that class though. so anyways. i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. a very few. whatever. i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. i just put """"so anyways"""" instead of """"so anyway"""" i think that sounds as dumb as """"laters"""" when one really means """"later"""". that is really very jr. high. i miss those days. i wonder how cindy is doing. ugh. i really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again. i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. damn that sounds really conceited. maybe i'm a little of that too. i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. it's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. within reason that is. so anyway. i am these things but i feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted. i know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. i am so proud of myself lately. i am being such a good girl. although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway. i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. i'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. i have been developing such good habits. i make my bed everyday, i wash my face twice a day, i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early. o shit. i just got a little flash of procrastination. that sneaky devil. no go away!!!. i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. i just don't have the time for that. i run every day . mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. damn that dinner. ugh. what else do i do. o yea. i didn't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too. i haven't been drinking. i haven't been too flakey. with the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. anyway we are good terms at the present. i'm being a pretty good daughter. i finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. i want to write about something cool. no luck. i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes. bad flutes in lol. i'm probably really bad by now. i wonder if there is practice rooms around. i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. i thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. and then i would act all shy and innocent. it's just how i act. natural reflex to wanted attention. sometimes i think i'm so stupid. and then they would flatter me and ask me out. and i would act like i wasn't really sure. i little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so i imagine) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. this has been a pleasant venting experience i tell you.

"i don't know what i should be doing right now. i mean life is so complicated and strange to me. my father says i can do whatever i want to at university and he will be happy with it, but the thing is if i do what i want then he would be pretty upset with me. hell, he would disown me. i don't know why i have to do things in order to please him but i have to. its like i have no choice. i am just starting to get his trust back and i don't want to lose that little bit that i have. you could say that i'm destined to do what other people want me to do. that is the way that society is these days. we are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow; and if we don't conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society. the """"norm"""" they call it. why does there have to be a """"norm"""". i don't see why we can't live the way that we choose and be free. oh well, back to happy thoughts. amanda. there is a happy thought. i wonder. i wonder what? i don't know. i guess i wonder if it will work. i'm nuts about he she is nuts about me, but we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. i guess that is true about a lot of couples. but i still don't know. what i do know is that i want to stay together, even though everyone is talking about us. i don't care how old she is. hell, she is only 2 years younger that me so that doesn't matter. people are just making a big deal out of it because i am in college and she is a sophomore in high school. she is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me. she understands a lot of things. i guess that is because she grew up in saudi. people there are generally more mature than people here in the states. we are forced to grow up faster than people here. we lose our innocence faster, and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker. lets leave it on this note. these are strange days that will challenge our true selves. i wish i could go deeper than that but i'm not going to spill all of my guts to a computer. later babe.

i am wondering why i am doing this writing assignment and if i really have to because i am doing the research also. the music that i am listening to right now is very loud. i wonder if i should go to class today. i am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that i didn't know about. the test coming up on the 15th worries me because i am not sure what it will be over or what to study. my forearm is already beginning to cramp up while i am typing. my leg itches. i like this song that is coming on now. my eyes are very tired. my head itches and i have to scratch it. i think i need to stretch my neck. i really need to start getting more sleep since i have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. there is something under my foot that is bothering me. i wonder how long i have been typing for. only five minutes. now i am feeling like this is going to take forever. it is kind of dark in the room that i am in. i'm thinking about pizza. now i am thinking about the girl who's room i am in. she is in the shower. i ate pizza with her for lunch. she is very beautiful. she sure has been in the shower for a long time. dave matthew's songs all sound alike to me. i can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 90's or something. my mind has gone blank for a second. what time is it now. only 8 minutes. how come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. if i was a girl i wouldn't get one. that would hurt and why go through that pain. i think the music is getting louder. cell phones! everybody is getting those too. and they keep getting smaller. that reminds me of lethal weapon 4 when chris rock complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. i can't think of anything. i am wondering if i really have to do this. time check. 12 minutes. it is hot. it smells like austin water. the water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. i need a chair in my room so when i watch tv i don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. my back is hurting right now. basketball caused my back problems. i should be playing basketball right now. everybody thinks i am obsessed with basketball because i talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. i want to be a basketball coach. i can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where i can't play or coach. i have to be a coach or i won't enjoy my job. this girl kim drops everything on her feet. i swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since i have been here. she just interupted my train of thought. i kind of like this stream of thought thing because i am realizing all the crazy stuff i think about in a given time. this song satellite. i mean what the hell is he talking about. it doesn't make since. time check. one more minute till i get to hit the infamous submit button. this was kind of fun. my arm is kind of tired though. ,0
"today i woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. i just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, wow! i hope she knows that made me feel special. i hope i make her feel special. because she is special to me. joanna what a unique name. it is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool i am typing on a laptop, i wish i could have my own. maybe i could save some money some how. i wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. god really blessed me. i worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. i got all the classes i wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. god is awesome. i am so bless through his love. i pray i make the most of it and continue be focused. i have so much time and yet i always want things faster. i seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. sweetie wow i just can't get over it. i am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. i love getting lost in those eyes. what if i didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? i hope not. does she feel the same way? if she does is this the one? or maybe it is another i have not met. i wish i knew. i have to be patient. all good things come in time. i wonder if she knows that i wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can i see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder i am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things i notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe i thinking too far ahead. all i now is i like it. i like joanna and she likes me. that is what i know. i know i want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why i am here in austin. maybe over christmas we can see more of each other.

"i don't have enough time in my day for important schoolwork, studying, work, rest time, and enough sleep to make me feel good. i haven't even left myself enough time on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays for lunch. what was i thinking making those work hours for myself. i gave myself 30 minutes to get to class. i have to wake up in the morning and work from 9 until whenever i get off to get to class in 30 minutes. that's no time to even stop and think or do an errand here and there. i had to go home this weekend to get a bunch of homework and studying done. i have one of the busiest weeks this week. everything seems to be due on the same day, but thankfully not the same hour. when can i sleep? i have to write four menus for four dinners of twenty people and write the ingredients list and have everything organized and typed. at least i can type and work here late at night. it is a getaway from my hot house and hot room. i should stay here all night one night. it's so cool and comfortable in here. i have to clean sometime today in between classes. the only reason i have time for anything now is because i didn't work today. i had to wake up with not enough sleep and i didn't even work today. i guess it's good though because i'm getting this and the pretesting done and that's important. i wonder if we get some sort of receipt for doing this like we are supposed to in the pretesting. i hope so it would be my luck that it doesn't get submitted. if someone is reading this, it was submitted. i wonder if anyone is actually reading this. it makes me so mad and frustrated with the mail system. it's always the really important letters and mail that gets lost. why did it have to be that letter that got lost? i have to go to some building to get my password for receiving email because i can't remember my password. i have to also pick up my financial aid check. maybe it's in the same building. i can't help correcting my errors as i type. it's a habit thing. my finger automatically goes to the delete key when i see an error. at least now i can what was i typing??? i think faster than i type and i type pretty fast, but as i type one thing i'm thinking of something else. it's weird to write down what you think. i don't usually think """"oh i'm thinking about this"""" i just think. thought just go through my head. usually the thoughts that i really hear are the worried and stressed out thoughts because i know i'm slacking already and what is it like the 3rd week of school? has it been 20 minutes yet? when you watch the time, it goes so slow. maybe that's what i should do to savor my time. just watch it. if i could watch a clock as i sleep it would be perfect. my sleep time would be good and long. well it's been twenty minutes. it makes me feel good that i got this done. that's one thing on my long list of things to do. what if they don't like my menu for the week? it's too boring. the menu for this week has so my variety. oh i don't care. i have to stop thinking or i'll never stop writing.

"i feel tired. a lot of school work. too many distractions yet no love, the one distraction i want to find. yet sometimes i don't want to find it. sometimes i just like to have fun and not get tied down by a relationship. but most of the time, when not with friends, when not with family, when all alone, i feel like i want to find the right chick. i feel hungry. won't eat though until i finish this writing assignment. started at 9:34. it is now 9:36. i have 18 minutes left. that took a while to think up because i hate math. i am not taking any math in college because i don't need it for predental. but i have a lot of chemistry. again, i have a lot of school work. never really worried about it until now because i procrastinated. the next two nights are going to suck. 9:37. damn. only a minute has gone by. really hungry now so i'll take a bite real quick. but i'm still typing with my right hand. i'm also really annoyed right now. i can't stand my roommate. he's a total loser. i can't wait to move out of here and get my own place next year. there is no way in hell that i'll share a room again for the rest of my life. i hope married life isn't going to be like this. like i said earlier, i really want to find """"the one,"""" and i feel like i need to in the next couple of years because that's when most people do, but the whole sharing a room experience has got me wondering. if marriage life is going to be as annoying as this, i'm going to be pretty disappointed. i mean, i never get as annoyed by chicks when i'm in a relationship, so maybe there's hope. roommate just came back. made a lot of noise so i lost my train of thought. it is 9:42. i started at 9:34 so 8 minutes have gone by. i'm amazed at how much i can write when i just write what is on my mind. roommate still in here making even more noise. roommate sighing and shuffling feet hoping to get attention from me because he sees i am doing homework. now he is ruffling potato chip bags and being louder hoping to annoy me even more. i'm still ignoring him, but now he has gone over to his computer and is blaring out music. again, he leaves to the sink and makes more noise over there. i'm still ignoring, but i'm getting more and more pissed off. now he is talking to himself aloud and coughing and typing extra loudly to again draw attention to himself. how childish. now he is tapping loudly. like a little kid trying to get attention. he is really pissing the hell out of me. i swear, there is no way in hell that i will ever room with someone in the same room for the rest of my life. damn, i just got a phone call. i'll have to call him back. man, i haven't talked to him in a while. he wants me join a frat. i wonder if that's what is call is about. okay, 9:47. i got 7 more minutes. well, my mind is pretty blank right now. i'm just thinking about what went on today. i went to lacrosse practice. and i bought some beer. my roommate thinks i'm an alcoholic because he doesn't drink so he doesn't know what an alcoholic is. at least all my real friends don't think i'm one. i miss my best friend hilary. she's at a&m right now. i've always had a crush on her. i remember daydreaming about getting married back in elementary school. she was the first girl i saw when i moved down here to tx. she never knew who i was until high school. then we became best buds. even though we're best friends, i think, actually, i'll be honest, i know that i still have a crush on her. pretty middleschoolish, but who knows, maybe one day, she may be """"the one"""". at least i wish she was. i can't wait to see her again. i never clean my room, but she's coming down in october so i'll be sure to clean it by then. girls are my weakness. i love chicks. thank god there's so many here at ut. its funny that i feel lonely sometime, even though i've met so many girls here that want to hook up with me. its just that the chicks that want to hook up with me are so plain. i dated beauty queens in high school and maybe its immaturity, but i can't date anybody who doesn't fit that beauty queen mold here at ut. although i am wanted by some chicks, i'm still lonely sometime because they're not the chicks i had in mind. i guess i'm too choosey. plus, i guess i like feeling sorry for myself every now and then. i used to like to cry at night when i'm alone, but now, knowing that i'm wanted, that's a thing of the past. well, time's up.

" well i am sitting in my apartment thinking how weird it is to live by myself with out a roomate. i stair at my fish, and don't know many of my neighbors since i am new to the austin area. my room is a mess, i am a total slob and hate to admit that. however, i would clean it up if i had a guest or to. but not during the week me and my friends are busy doing homework and trying to inteact with orginizations around the ut campus. i still miss my dance at blinn. i worked so hard for that team and myself finally made friends in that little town. i am happy to be at a new school though for a new fresh start. tryouts for the ut dance team are on thursday and i am debating back and forth if i will make it and how bad i really want it. i know for a fact i really want that spot on the dance team it would be a complete honor. but then again i have this attitude that if i don't care the dissapointment will not hurt as bad if i don't get the spot. i am just so use to being on a dance team and belonging to a group. everyone knows me as the dancer. so what am i now if i don't make the dance team? i actually miss home its been about a month and a half since i have seen my parents and i miss my 2 cats soo bad! i miss my ex boyfriend terribly and wish i could see although he is 3 and 1'2 hrs away at sam houston university. i miss those hugs he would give everyday even when we were friends they honestly made me feel good inside. i am acutally quite bothered that my boyfriend won't call me back. i haven't seen him in 3 days and just wanted to see him for a little while. everytime i ask him if i can see him and have to ask still after 5 months of going out he always answers with a i don't know. i feel like i need a lot of attention and hurts my feelings when he seriously does that. not allowed to hang out with my best guy friend because these two don't get along however i don't agree with that and hang out with him anyways. i don't feel as i have to clear everything with him. i am happy that i have my two best friends here though quite close on campus. one my bestfriend from highschool didn't see much of eachother there for a while because i went away to school for 2 years and she stayed home. alice and me have been roomates for 2 years in a tiny dorm room and decided that we wanted to live by ourselves for a change. i actually enjoy it and can do as i please. i am aslo worried about finding study buddys for my classes because i am sure my grades will be better if i study with others. its hard to just start talking to people. when i am new i can be a bit shy. but once you get to know me i am a quite talkative person full of energy but people don't know that unless they approach me. i need to dye my hair red again becuase my mousy brown hair is starting to show again and i hate it. . glad i don't have to go to work today becaue i have soo much to do this week. i should really clean up my apartment because i have a major ant problem going on here especially in the kitchen. its one of my best friends birthday's today i called her up and shes going out tonight wish i was here but i'm not in houston. wish i could be home. my dad just lost his job but has been wanting to leave for awhile. and does have a back up he has his own business called inland homes . now i am glad he can dedicate all he can to his dreams which is having a successful business of his own. i am worried about him though he has been very stressed out latley. i need to call t. c to get help with my homework. . i will pass that darn t. a. s. p test soon! i don't have any other choice i am eager to get out of math and graduate college.

"i just ate brisket, rice and kimchi. it is a very odd mixture but it was really good. i can still smell the barbecue sause and taste the sause on the corners of my mouth. i can't believe how much things i want to accomplish this semester and everything seems to go slow. it is difficult making friends because i'm not used to ssing so many students in one class, and everything time i have a ifferent group of people i sit with. i feel lonely and a little bit frustrated sense i am not really sure what would make me feel alittle better. it is friday and it seems like it is the weekend, it is a bit odd because i am not in school or in class. a few minutes ago i came back from barnes and nobles, and i attempted to study biology, chemistry and alittle bit for this class but i only managed to study for biology. mitosis, what an interesting process. it is still boring because i know all this material from high school. i get so bored of learning the old material over and over again. however, this chapter did continue on with the enzymes and other chemical components it needed. i am so tired right now. i had a very nice sleep, maybe a little over eight hours but i am so tired. i kind of dozed off at bn, and i stopped reading. instead i picked up a harry potter book i haven't been able to read and started to read it. i think i wasted more time reading that book than reading one chapter in biology. i got into that book quite quickly and i wasn't able to put it down. i started to have a headache and i got hungry. i don't have a headache anymore. gee. it's only seven minutes and i have about thirteen minutes left. how come everytime i stop counting or timing i end at the number thirteen? thirteen hours of classes, thirteen minutes left, thirteen this and thirteen that. my goodness, i must have tons of bad luck. or. is this my lucky number? haha, that would be very interesting. i feel quite happy right now i am still remember the events that occured last night. i can still here the the drums vibrating off the speakers and the guitars and the singers that i can barely hear. frequency. it was pretty nice for the first one i went to. it was so humid and i felt so sticky. gross. i dont' know what i am thinking right now. my train of thought seems to be discombobulated. i always go to one subject to the next. it seems that everyone does that, but it is weird. even when i talk to many people, i digress off the subject. i can not believe i am typing for twenty minutes. i've done this before, but i had to hand write it out. the good thing about hand writing is that it takes a longer time and you don't have to constantly think or what you are thinking next. my eyes are feeling alittle droopy now. should i close my eyes and type? haha. . okay i will do that. i might start falling asleep if i do this. maybe i should open my eyes again. okay, well, i wonder if grammar and punctuation and capitalization really matters in this writing assignment. what a coincidence. . it's been thirteen minutes again. why do i do this to myself. my hands are feeling a little numb from typing this, but my palms haven't become sweating, but my fingers feel weird. maybe it is because of the rubber band aroiund my wrist, is must be cutting off circulation. i am thinking right now that i won't be able to quit. i just heard my brother's alarm on his watch. my brother is still in highschool, i wonder how much torture he's going through. i hated us history in highschool, and now my brother is taking it. it's not that i hated the content, i didn't like the teacher. she was so evil. the clock rang that it is three-o'clock. my aim had shut the door telling me that someone went offline. wow, i am still going on. three more minutes left. my neck is hurtingn and i want to quit. i think this assignment is so long. i want to take a break, but i dont' think i will be able to. i think i am typing faster than i was in the beginning. i want this writing assignment to be over now. now now now now now now! i am just babbling out. i am looking at the xperiment record sheet for psychology. wow, five hours? yes one more minute left to do this. should i count down? i want this to be over now. i wish it was over not. why almost thirty more seconds. i am so impatient now. very impatient. very very impatient. almost done ten more five seconds. look like it is over.

" i went to church tonight. it makes me feel very calm and relaxed. it puts the world into such a different perspective. everything seems so simple. it makes me want to be a much better person. the television is on. i think it's on mtv. i'm not watching it though. that's annoying song on that commercial. i don't want to go back to school on tuesday. i have a lot of work to do including reading for this class. i can't wait till friday. i get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town. i hate commercials. i don't like eating college food. i really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat. my roommate went home for the weekend. it's weird being here alone. i have been going to sleep late this weekend. i turned off the tv. i went to the football game last night. it was fun. there was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol. it makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in. it's very quiet. i want to join clubs here. i really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center. i want to make a difference that way. i'm really hungry so i am eating burnt popcorn. i will prob. make some more after i finish this. i don't know what the point of this is. i think it's a cool assignment, but i wonder what it is going to show about the way i think. i want my boyfriend to call. i miss him a lot. i saw my friends today. i bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them. they are really cute. my boyfriend is from brasil. it just occurred to me that i'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z. i'm a horrible speller. the tower was so pretty last night. i think it is my favorite part of campus. i look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it. i love it. i like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower. they're just really cool. i think i hear one of my suite mates. she went to visit her boyfriend in san marcus. i wish my boyfriend was closer. it's hard having him so far away. i know everything will work out though because i love him so very much. wow. i can't wait till friday. it was really cool visiting him in michigan. my dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th. that is also luis and i's 5 month anniversary. wow. that's a long time. i want to marry him. that may sound weird. too soon or whatever. but it's true. i never thought i would find someone so amazing. he told me that he wants to marry me someday. i wish that i could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again. i went to this meeting on studying abroad on friday. it was pretty boring. it was interesting how many countries you can go to. i want to do that one day. that would be fun to experience another culture. i mean i've been to europe before but only for a couple of weeks. not long enough to learn about it in-depth. i have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends. it's kind of sad. especially this weekend. i'm surprised how many people left. i love the picture of my baby next to my printer. he's so adorable. he makes me feel so special. i'm thirsty. why isn't my boyfriend calling me? i love the sound of his voice. i forgot that i wanted to call my mom today. i wanted to tell her about the game and find out about bridgette. i hope she is alright. the priest at church prayed for the people in florida. i'm happy that carmen goes to church now. my friend once told me that she didn't believe in god. i hope she does now. i almost started crying in church because i was so happy. i like when my boyfriend goes to church with me. he's such a better person now that he's going out with me. it's amazing how much he's changed. he stopped drinking. not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend. he wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot. i want to talk to my friend ben. he's at lsu. wow. 20 minutes is a long time. i can't believe i'm still writing. it's getting pretty boring. i don't know what else to think about. i miss my nephews they are so cute. i don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion. that's so incredibly sad. i hope i can help put an end to abortions one day. it makes me sick just thinking about it. i really don't like analynn. goodness she is very mean and fat. i'm glad that i never have to see her.

"i like this writing assignment. it seems easy. i know i'm doing this pretty early, but it's okay. i don't want to go to class tomorrow. my roommate is playing his music pretty loudly but i don't care because i do the same thing. i wonder if i set my alarm clock. 8:30 is way too early for me. i sure do type slowly. i can still hear my roommate's music. i need to pee, but i can't. i have to wait 20 minutes. this is getting boring. i'm not very thoughtful today. maybe it's because i am tired. i may go to sleep early today, but i know i won't. i am so glad that i only have two classes tomorrow. my roommate is talking on the phone again. i'm very delighted that i got a cool roommate. man, only seven minutes passed. i'm getting so tired and bored. my roommate just left. he sure does go out a lot. i hope he doesn't wake me up tomorrow morning. home. i miss my house, my turtles, my mom, my dad, and my friends. i sure do have lots of electronics in my dorm. i wonder why dogs howl at the moon. man that was sure random. my keyboard is pretty cool. i still need to pee. gosh only ten more minutes to go. i am halfway there. my shoulder is starting to hurt. i wonder how many words i can type a minute. gosh, i'm glad that i am using word. i cannot spell today. i still need to get my course packet. i'll probably go tomorrow. this is weird. i feel like i am talking to myself, but it is kind of cool. i wonder how people just came up with computers. i am sure glad that i am living in a society with ac. i would so be sweating everyday. it's so hot here, but not as humid as houston, that is a plus. i wonder if i am supposed to be writing sentences or not. oh well, i only have five more minutes to go. i don't watch television as much as i used to. i need to start watching the news. i never know what's going on in the world. i don't even know the names of the presidential candidates' running mates. gosh, i wonder how many words i have typed so far. this page is filling up. there are only three more minutes to go. then i get to send this in. i wonder if you are going to read this. i need to stop my online slang for writing. my chair sounds like a fart when i move it. oh oh, two more minutes, and then i'm done. that pretesting sure took a long time to fill out. one more minute left. man, i lost my thought. i wonder how many seconds are left. my stomach is starting to make noises. there sure are a lot of underlinings in this paper. woohoo, all done.

"i am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time i really feel like crying right now. i don't know what is wrong with me . i don't want to go back to school i really hate it there. i really just wish that i could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. i just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but i may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if i will be at a different school in a month. atleast i have adam there with me at school i am only happy when i am with him but i can't be with him all the time i have got to live my own life. he says that if i hate the dorm so much that i should move in with him but i am really scared to , i think because i am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if i change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and i believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what i want. i am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when i first moved to austin . i know that i cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. i am scared to talk to her about anything because i am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. i wish i was good at talking back to people and that i wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but i can't help it i don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. i don't want to make them mad at me but what can i say . the few times that i did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like i am freaking out. why are people so mean. i am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok i don't even understand myself. i just want to be happy and i am not happy right now and now that i am home i want to go back to school because i feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. i will figure it all out one day ",1
" ok, writing. i started this a few minutes ago but apparently in mozilla firefox the timer doesn't work. sorry if i end up submitting two essays. right now i'm kind of hungry. my stomach is growling, i haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning. i didn't use to eat breakfast, but now i do. one minute down. i feel pressured, like i have to continue hitting keys or i'm not doing as well as i should on this writing assignment. which is strange because all i have to do is write something, anything, and i get credit for it. is it cheating if i use the backspace key to edit my mistakes? there are quite a few of them. i probably would type better and therefore faster if i slowed down, which is paradoxical but true. i am also sleepy. maybe i will take a nap, except i have to study. hooray. that's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do. i'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday. the description of the rat kind of makes me wish i was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped. seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant. maybe in this case it does. i wonder what it's like. maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical). maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure. quite a way to go. i am running out of things to write about and it's only been 5:30 minutes. my mind is becoming a blank. perhaps i can shove something in there. nope. rub a dub dub, three men in a tub. i'm regressing back to childhood, oh no! forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what i would have expected. if you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive. i wonder why i keep bringing up images and thoughts from when i was young? perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what i learned yesterday or what i see on mtv. mtv. i do not like that channel at all. i do not like it in a boat, i do not like it with a goat. i do not like it, sam i am, i do not like music television. the channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against. at least they encourage people to vote. that's a positive message coming from a negative source. i guess no one or nothing is truly evil. well, nine minutes gone. i'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as bilbo put it. like everything in my mind has already come out and i'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw. of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and i suppose it's the same with the mind. one thing i never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness. in the textbook it seems like a step is skipped. an analogy can be made (and has been, i assume) between the mind and the computer. one could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text. but the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data. where are the programs in the mind? it's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement. where is the software? i'm just rambling now. although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it? ha ha. i tried to read the book house of leaves, i was told it was brilliant, but you know what? it, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks. it's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it. speaking of which, hello, whoever is reading this! i hope you're having a wonderful day. although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day. still, someone's got to do it, right? someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it. then the worker loses their job. which is better, i wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all? some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us. we will become like asimov's solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population. eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human. or maybe not. what will be the point of civilization then? what is the point of it now? to keep people happy? great job so far, i must say. nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals. more and more chemicals, pills, etc. to cure the imbalances in their head. they should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware! biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far. people who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them? eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed. quite a while to be writing. you know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short. i love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it. if only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention. it all deals with people's perception anyway -- i bet there is a way, somewhere. although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea. speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up. it's been a pleasure.

"today has been a very stress ful day starting with the first time i ever missed a class. today my parents and i got in a fight and i was going to be late to class so i decided to just not go. this caused my parents to be evenmore upset with me. not to mention that we were already stressed about the apartment situation for next year. isn't that retared to hav eto sign a lease in september for the following school year? you don't even know if you will get along with the people that you ahve agreed to live with for the entire year. a realty company makes everything so much more difficult. we have to pay a application fee and a security depsoit of $35 adn $480 respectivly. in the upcoming week we have to put our firsty monts rent down which is $481. it is just rediculous that we have to worry about this at this point in time. i am also extremly stressed about school. first of all i don't know what to expect coming from hogh school to college. second of all, all the professors throw all this stuff at you st once and expect you to remeber itall. it is completly over whelming to a freshman. third on my list, my soroity is also giving us all these dates to remember, things to sign up for, dues to pay, committments to fulfill that everything is all mumble jumble in my head. i am completely overwhelmded. foutrh of all, i never get any sleep. i had to go home to houston to get rest and to be able to study. fifth -- i have not been able to fit my routine work out into my schedule yet. i am terrified about gaining the freshman fifteen. this summer i wroked so hard to lose weight, and i finally did. i will be greatly depressed if i gain it back and more!!!! college is supposed to be the best four years of your life, but so far it has been one big stress pile up. i can;t take it. not to mention that i am completwly homesick. i am so close to my family it is ridiculous. i miss my mom to no extent. my sister just got engaged and i feel like i am missing out on all of the party plans. i feel so far away. my dad has to be the most unselfish wise person i know. he adds so much to a converation. i miass them all so much. everyhting brings me to tears these days if i start to think too long about it. one of the most important things in my life i forgot. my dog jake. i miss his sweet face so much. he was such a good friend and companion. i never have any time to email my friends in london or in other colleges around the nation. i also feel like i am having a hard time opening up to my surrounding s whether it is to my girlfriends or to guys. i wish everything wasn't always a drunken brawl. i don't mind the partying if it only were in moderation. anyways, i think i am just having to get adjusted and that it is just taking me longer than others. everything is all so important to me:grades friends, guys, family, beliefs etc. why can't evrything just be perfect????

"stream of consciousness well here i am. i wonder why the professor asked us to do this? i had to do this once before. i can't remember what class it was for. i think it was for english class. i liked my english teacher. i think her name is mrs. siskovic. she was a good teacher. she sounded when she read to us. i'm glad i took that dual credit english class, now i don't have to take english in college. that is one less thing to worry about. i wonder if i turned off the oven? oh yeah, i did. i can't believe i left the refrigerator open all night. i'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. i just bought it. at least i don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. i need to buy more cereal. that new cereal is pretty good. i think those fish sticks upset my stomach. i think next time i'll buy fish fillets. i like fish and fishing. i wonder if there is any place to fish around here. i think lake wytnie is close but i'm not sure. then again it be far. i don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. i think i'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. i really miss her. i hope she goes to st. edwards next year so she will be closer and i can see her more often. i can't believe i have to go to acc next semester to take college algebra. i must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. i've already taken calculus in high school and i made an a. i can't believe i scored so low on the sat 2 math part. i wonder if there is any more kool-aid left? i think there is grape, get some when i'm done. i'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. my hand is cramping. i think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. i hope i can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. i guess i'll just ask somebody. i hate to ask people things, especially directions. i think i'm done.

"""" i laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists. they should just appreciate the music. i think by saying that i was being a hypocrite because i was criticizing the people who criticize. does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite. deep, huh? i'm wearing contacts. i like my sunglasses. they are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors. wow, i am only have way done. hey, maybe that means i'm optimistic. i am such a bad speller. i spend way to much time thinking about school. i'm such a nerd. everyone else goes out and parties and i stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours. but i do tend to watch a lot of tv, wait, i haven't been watching much tv during this past week at ut. only about 1 hour per day. i'm so proud of myself. i can't believe that i haven't procrastinated this assignment. i don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts. i guess i'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice. i bought new caprice. my mom just washed them. i went to the b. e. s. t. thing sponsored by the business school. it was so much fun. we went to the lake. hello, jenny wrote me a note. my printer is off. i can't think of anything else to write about. i was valedictorian, i was nervous when i said my speech. yay for 5. 0 gpa. for having such a high gpa, you would think that i wouldn't be so scatterbrained. i think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing. i have to sign up to do that psychology experiment. i want to do the prescreening. victoria says that it takes two hours. i want to get it over with and not procrastinate. i have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it. i like this song, and that song, well, maybe not. i want to go so sleep. i went to sleep early last night 9:30. oh, this is that singer chad kroger (i am such a bad speller). i liked spiderman 2. i have always been a fan of stuff like that: spiderman, batman, superman, etc. i like smallville on the wb. it is a good show. what else. i can't think of anything else. ok, i have about 3 and a half minutes left. what else should i do. i have chemistry in an hour but i should leave in 1'2 an hour because i want to get a good seat in class. i'm so blind, even with my contacts. i don't want to sit in the very front row because then i will strain my neck having to look straight up at the professor. i have professor laude. he is very funny. i went to a discussion session at 11. wait, it was at 10 and ended at 11am. i think is was fairly productive. i'm a business major. did i mention that. i'm also pre-med. i want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist. that is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor. it will be able to be cool to say that though. my mom was a doctor. my dad has a phd, so he is in a sense a doctor. he is asst. dean of the business school at unt. i like this song. it is by maroon 5. nigel, my older brother, he is 23, i think, likes this song. he has this cd and will never let me borrow it. he called me last night and was ",1
"it is hard to put thoughts and feelings into words. the air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. my stomach has felt bad all day, i took pepto bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. i'm tired, and it's only 10:00. this house is always so messy, i wish bryan would help me keep it clean. i'm going to start doing better. the picture of deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. what am i going to wear tomorrow? i don't want to have to wake up early. i have to wake up at 9, i guess that isn't that early. i had so much fun at my family reunion. i miss my family even though i just saw them 2 days ago. some woman on the tv was trying to kill her kid, kathy bush wanted to kill her daughter? the news is so horrible. it's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. i think more people should be executed. the government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. if someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. i can't wait until christmas. i already know what i'm going to get bryan and my mom, and my dad. we're going to get my dad a 56 k modem. he's wanted one for a long time. what a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. oh well. i don't want to type for 12 more minutes. i think this assignment is stupid. i don't see the point. or maybe there is a point, but i'm not helping because i'm doing it wrong. what does it matter, is anyone really going to read this? i feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. oh good, i didn't want bryan to come over and read this, he left the living room. our apartment is pretty smalll but i resally like living in austin. finally, he's going to take out the trash. only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 60 years for molesting a child. what makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. i think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. they are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. i think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. i hate democrats. i hate bill clinton. i will be so glad when he is no longer our president. i hope bush runs next year, i know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 7 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 7:30. so should i go to the trig review class or should i go to church? i think i'll end up leaving early from class so i can make it to church. i need to get my priorities straight. it's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. i want to save peolpe from going to hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. now i'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like i""""m some crazy conservative person. narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. the bible says loud and clear that more people will go to hell than heaven.

"it seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and i lack control over when that thought surfaces. i have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, i need money. i can list what i need to do but once i get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. i can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, i think he's the one i'm going to marry. this relationship is just too good to ignore, so i wonder about him a lot. we have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. i've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and i noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. i still have a better work ethic than he does. but he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. i suppose also, i'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. i am a rather independent person. i don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and i don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but i rather spend a day locked in a 4 x 4 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. now that is what i call companionship. i haven't had a best friend like him since i was 7. i don't think i would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 4 hours away. another thing that concerns me is the way i have organized my higher education. i haven't really picked out a major, i'm not even on a reasonable track. i'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what i like to read about but i don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. i like math too, and i want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though i don't plan on majoring in any of those. my major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and english classes, and i absolutely hate english. i wanted to go to ut because i wanted to learn more. i like some of school in that i like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that i would have never thought existed. but the way ut works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. we are learning in order to work. why can't we learn just to learn. maybe i will be a social science major.

"i am feeling a little nervous right now. i just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. normally i wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. i walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. i never found it. hopefully the fact that i was not in class will go unnoticed. i had a very busy day, and every little thing i do every day i have to think about twice. i can not react on impulse here in college, because if i do i could get into trouble with people i would rather not be in trouble with. if i do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. i got my ou wristband today. i had to get up very early in order to do this. i was tired out from last night as well. i have to get up early again on thursday in order to get my actual ticket. the ou tickets are thirty five dollars. this is pretty expensive. from what i hear it is worth it though. a lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. we're going to take buses to dallas and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. it sounds like a blast. one of my friends from high school moved to dallas to go to smu for college. it will be good to see him. one of my other friends went to west point for college. i respect the guy with all my heart. i don't know how he does what he does. i got to see on labor day for the first time in like three months. that was really nice. he does not think that west point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. the beginning of college has been fun so far. i've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. i enjoy living on my own. i live with three other guys from corpus christi. they are all really cool. i enjoy private times sometimes too. it is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and i get the whole place to myself. it's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. they spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. it would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. i just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. well it has been about twenty five minutes now so i am going to check spelling and submit my work.

"ever since this assignment was introduced in class, i've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). it's just that when i sit down at the computer to type something, i usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. never have i just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. i guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because i find it so hard to express myself at times. the other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, """"that's you!"""" i guess i had never really thought about that label applying to me. but once you started listing examples, i had an epiphany. i guess i am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. i like everything neat, clean, and orderly. i can't stand having a dirty living space. i mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? for me, it's just not possible. plus, i think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. i like to make good first impressions and the way i maintain my room is a way of achieving that. i think i get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. i remember one time i started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because i wasn't washing the dishes """"the right way. """" of course i can't really complain because i do a lot of that too. i understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but i just like to do things my way because i see the logic in it. a lot of my friends think i'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if i wasn't, i can't even imagine what my life would be like. being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. it is something that will never change. i guess i shouldn't say that because every time i say i will never do something, i end up doing it later on. for example, when i was younger, i told my older sister i would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. so i guess that's why i should never say never. i have so much to do today. i probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. of course i had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing jeopardy online with my boyfriend. i've always loved playing intellectual games. it makes me feel great when i can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. it amazes me the things i remember from some of my classes in high school. and sometimes, that information came from classes that i thought were totally useless at that time. now, i realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe calculus when you're studying to be a communications major).

"right now i am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. i really wish that i had worked on this assignment earlier. i am now starting to worry because i have to finish calculus homework and read a few pages for engineering. and i have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. it is bugging me that i left that one problem unfinished. it is also bugging me that i left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. i never thought about that before, but i do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. weird. i just had an epiphany. it is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. like a word you've never heard before. take before. before before before before before before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. that is really odd. and it works with every word, too. hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. not thinking of much anymore. i used to think of how much i missed home. now it is not so prominent. i don't think of roshi as much. i still do sometimes. but it comes and goes. i am not going to let myself get trapped like i have before. it is just a vicious cycle. i feel much better this time. i have somehow learned to overcome sadness. i dunno exactly how it happened, but i have learned to overcome and bypass it. it doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. now that i think about it, i am really starting to wonder how i managed to do that. inherently, i think that i can get fixated easily; that right there is a sign that i am bound to get hurt one of these days. and i have. but i have learned. the question is, how? hmm. oh well. no matter now. as long as i can do it. that is good enough for me. maybe its the college atmosphere. being alone and on my own. in a sense, anyway. i look around my room and realize that i do not miss home. i don't know why. i missa family and friends at time, but i don't miss them. its weird. maybe its because i don't consider myself away from them. mysha said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on labor day. maybe i need to stay away from home longer. hmm. that must be it. mysha got me thinking about roshi again. hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. it can't be too hard; lots of people have already met people. i jsut need to go and try. steve knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. comes natural to him though. i honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. i feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. i am liking the way i am handling things, liking the way i have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that i can make my own decisions. i am starting to feel better and better about college life. it is great. except for all the people. there is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. a sort of fakeness. many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. people don't act the way i am used to seeing them act in high school. maybe that is it. asians don't act like asians at home, for one thing. most other people act the same, but the asians here don't. a little different. a little meaner? that can't be it though, i really need to meet more and judge. ugh. i feel like i've just cursed myself for saying that. i really didn't mean that. i am being too cynical i guess. but you can't win them all. i am happy otherwise; i have met a few good friends, i like the campus, and i am close to home. i feel connected in all aspects. ut was probably one of the best choices i ever made. my dad thinks so. he told me the other night. i always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. he usually is, i've learned. almost always. i need to learn to respect that. i'm the one who's usually wrong. oh well. better late than never. time for calculus.

"when i first heard about our first writing assignment, i figured it would be very difficult because i am used to writing about a specified subject matter. but hopefully i can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how i feel. actually, i think i'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. it was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that i might feel or think. i also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. well, i don't have much of either (self-esteem' self-confidence). hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in austin i will develop these traits. when i first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. i almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' i mean, i knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, i was not able to do it. for example, i hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! so i naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because i wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. but i quickly learned here, that you have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. in fact, the question i probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. so i think i have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. in addition, i would always do everything with my friends. and upon coming to austin, i feel'felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. usually, i'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. so these past few weeks, i did not let myself do that. i very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. this was very rewarding, in that, i don't feel as lost in such a big university, and i'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. this is a characteristic which i will need for my expected major. i'm still not too keen on what exactly i want to do because when i think about it, i want to do'be everything, but when i think about it again i don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! but i think i'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. i'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down that much. but i still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. i don't know if i should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. so i'm really confused about that. hopefully, i will learn more about myself through my college journey at ut.

"i do not want to draw that apple again. it's so redundant that it completely diminishes the idea of art. i mean, i understand that professor gant wanted us to experience the """"discipline"""" aspect of art, but it's really hard to express yourself with a piece of fruit. it's not even like one of those beautiful pieces of fruit you see in most paintings. it's from the jester cafeteria, so of course it looks like it's been through hell. i can't believe i paid seventy cents for it. that's relatively cheap, but it's a bruised, disgusting piece of fruit. the food there is expensive compared to the quality of it. day before yesterday, i paid almost three dollars for a bowl of wilted salad and a glass of tea. maybe i'm just being cheap, well, actually it's my parents money, so it really doesn't affect me, but still. i need to call my parents. you'd think emailing them everyday and calling them every other day or like every three or four days would be enough. but no, they insist that we talk every day so that my mom can whine about how she really wants me to come back home and go to lamar. i know she's not being serious, they really want me here, but the whining gets really old, really fast. i'm so glad i got away from that area, it's such a hellhole. everyone knows everyone else's business. i guess that's typical of a small town, but i hate it. here no one cares who you are. i guess there are good and bad sides of that, but mostly good. my roommate is so loud. she's really nice and all, but she's a little annoying. she's also extremely hypocritical. she claims to be so openminded and liberal, but then i've heard her put down people who are religious, which is really closeminded. i was offended by it, too, i mean she knows that i'm a christian and she knows that i go to church, which, by most standards is considered """"religious"""". oh well, i haven't been """"preachy"""" about my views, so i guess i'll just attribute her closemindedness to ignorance. i really want to go to the counting crows concert, i'll have to get the tickets soon though. adam duritz voice is so powerful. anyone who can evoke so much emotion from listeners using a song, has to be a musical genius. i mean how is it possible that i didn't cry when my parents left me here in a city of a million people, five hundred miles away from home. yet, i cry when i hear him sing about a lost love. i don't even think it's the words that get me. well, that could be part of it, but i guess it's the combination of the music and the lyrics and adam crooning them out. i mean, i could be in a perfectly good mood, and i listen to a song, and halfway through it tears are streaming down my face. and i do this to myself repeatedly. it's almost like a sickness, maybe i have ocd or something. i hardly ever become emotional at movies or other times when the typically """"sensitive"""" girl would cry. maybe subconsciously i know that i need to cry at certain times, and that's what makes me listen to the music.

" i'm sitting at the pcl library, i can hear the computers humming, i'm typing kind of fast so i'm worried that people will find this annoying, because i sometimes do and sometimes when i click the mouse too fast some people get annoyed. my feet are really hurting from the bruises i think i got from the car accident on wednesday, i'm wondering if i should go to the university health center and talk to someone about it, but i don't know if i'll have time to go up there, and maybe there's nothing to worry about and bruises will fade by themselves anyway. now i'm thinking about the calculus quiz that i did yesterday, i did really bad on it. i ran out of things to say, i'm really sleepy. my uncle left today i feel bad that i didn't say goodbye but he left so early in the morning back to lebanon, i don't know how long it will be until i see him again but he wasn't as friendly as he was a year ago. i remembered last night that it was my 2 friend's birthdays, it was my brother's too and i didn't get him anything. . i really should have, i should go today, but i'm so concerned about how much money i've been spending lately, i don't work anymore and i'm running out of money i should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 95. 5, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now. i want to lay down somewhere, close my eyes. i feel like cuddling with someone. but my boyfriend won't do it, he'd just want to make out. i don't, i just want someone to hold me. suddenly i feel like crying a little bit. i don't know what's bothering me. a girl sat next to me who looks like jennifer the si instructor. those sessions are helpful.

" there is this chomping sound coming from my brothers mouth. he's eating cereal. sometimes i am jealous of this, because he has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. even quinby has his own place with a kitchen and everything. someday i will have these things for myself. my own life, with my own things. like in days of our lives. there will be days of my life when i do what i want, with whomever i choose. until then i must continue doing things their way . everyone else's way, like my mom. my nose itches. it is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a scratch? it is very annoying to itch. when i got sunburned, i itched extremely badly. sara laughed at me because i was jumping around in discomfort. i never want to feel like that again. sunburns suck. i miss sara though. even though i did not see her much, i always knew she was just down the street. but things are different now. that made it sad for me to leave. the fact that she isn't down the street anymore. that was like a security for me. just knowing. i am in a hurry to finish this assignment. i have to be in class in about half an hour, and i am nowhere close to where i need to be. life can make you feel like that. like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. everything in never alright. that's and oxy-moron. things don't work that way. but things do tend to work themselves out. you just have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. i always want something better. i feel like i am always in transit. it's had for me to be happy with the present. at least i can let go of the past, now. that was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. still, i look forward to, and fear the future. i do know things are good now. i am on my own, a little bit. i don't want to rush things. i am in no hurry to grow up. well, not a big hurry at least. i do want the rest of my life to come. i want to marry quinby, have a house, and pets. i am going to have a rabbit. maybe two. kids eventually, but not for a long while. the television is such a distraction! i can get side tracked forever. i like how it takes me out of this life. it is definitely an escape.

" wow this assignment seems pretty easy for a homework assignment. unfortunately i was unable to find the opera page for the prescreening, so i am now doing my homework although it's actually due friday. i should not procrastinate. i need to go to with my roommate to eat at j2 tomorrow at 12:30, instead of at kinsolving. i like kinsolving better than j2 but the food isn't too bad either. my girlfriend is online right now and talking to me, i wonder what her i'm box says while it flashes on my computer monitor. i will go click on it now and check. she was wondering what i had to write about for psychology class. i told her i had to write my stream of consciousness for 20 minutes. i'm starting to run out of things to say for this thing, although my mind is constantly thinking and putting material for me to write on this. wow it's only been 3 minutes so far, i still have a long way to go. i really can't think of anything to write in here. i wonder if i should capitalize all the 'i's in this thing or now, or whether grammar matters at all. oh my girlfriend imed me again i think i'll go look at what she has to say. she has to go practice chinese for her class. hmm only 4 minutes now, i don't' think i can write for another 16 minutes. i wonder if i can just stop writing right now and just turn it in at the end of the 20 minutes. but wow this thinking is actually still providing material for me to write in this thing. stil a lot of time left, my hands are starting to get fatigued, and my contacts are drying up. it's getting late and i'm getting tired at the same time. should i go to my math class tomorrow or not. my roommate is playing a really loud tv show, it appears to be star trek enterprise, i can't really concentrate with it playing in the backgrond. i am really tempted to watch it though, instead of writing this thing, but i suppose i should write this anyway. i want to take a shower too, but i can't because i have to write in this thing for another 13 minutes. the reptilians will take their place. says the tv show. i want to watch the show now i think i will. my roommate is pouring water into a cup and drinking from it. my body is a bit sore from working out at gregory earlier this evening. i also have a canker sore in my mouth and it does hurt a little. i think i will ask the psychology teacher tomorrow about the prescreening thing. i wonder if i'm spelling tomorrow correctly. i think i will go on to dictionary. com and check. it appears i have spelled 'tomorrow' correctly after all. i'm satrting to just space out while writing this thing, and getting rather tired. i like playing espn football 2k5. i usually beat my friend matt in it, but not my friend philip. i have been playing for the past two hours, maybe that is why i am tired now. i wonder if my girlfriend is done studying her chinese yet. i'm going to go check her profile. she is still away. i want a glass of water, i think i will go pour one for myself. i found a bottle of ozarka that i got from my friend so i am drinking out of that. my roommate explained to me that the star trek episode he is watching is based on the time when humans just reached space and are pioneering it, a few hundred years before captain kirk. even though the series is rather new. it seems interesting. my girlfriend is having trouble memorizing chinese. my friend clinton called and is now talking to me. it will be hard to multitask. i'm not really paying attention to him. he is asking me if i am eating with other friends. my friend did not get a bid for a frat, so he will not be pledging. we are going to a party on friday. perhaps with kdphi sorority. my girlfriend is asking what i am writing about again, and is falling asleep from doing homework. i am rather tired, ",1
"the problem i have with this writing assignment is that there is so much going on in my life right now that all of these different worries and concerns keep popping into my head. the one thing that i am looking forward to is that today i am meeting my parents in la grange for dinner. they are giving me my fraternity dues in the form of a check and my answering machine . my pledge brother brian is listening to mtv right now so it is very hard to concentrate and rigit is pissing me off. my humanities course is causing me a lot of stress because the teacher did not pass out any kind of syllabus so i have no idea how i will be graded. it just occurred to me that this essay is sounding more like the second writing assignment than the first, but i guess it doesn't really matter if school is what's on my mind. the girl next door has been on my mind a lot. lately i find myself wondering what she is doing even though we agreed to be just friends because she lives next door. and now that i think about it another girl is always on my mind too. however she lives upstairs and i'm pretty sure i could hook up with her if i wanted. i am very excited about my fraternity. i am looking forward to our bar tap on friday and i have promised myself i wouldn't drink until then. i really need to establish a routine, because i think once i do that i will be a lot less stressed. i need to start working out again to so that i won't feel like a complete piece of crap for partying too much. last night i went to san marcos to see the girl i am kind of dating but actually i don't feel any kind of affection for her. which is something i should tell her because she apparently likes me alot. i think i am starting to get kind of sick . probably has something to do with the fact i go to bed between 5 and 6 every night, but at least i scheduled afternoon classes.

"my roommate finally just left for work! i don't mean to say finally with such a relief, but my head is just pounding from her music! i really like her a lot, we get along great, we just don't have the same taste in almost anything. now, i'm not a neat freak, but living in such a small place for the next nine months, i would kind of like to keep the room picked up. i don't think she feels the same way! this morning, she ate cheerios, but threw most of them away, so our room smelled like rotten cheerios all morning. she finally threw them away, it's not so bad. i think some of her habits and ways come hand in hand with the fact that she is an art major. i don't mean to be stereotypical, it just seems that the artist in her contributes to her taste in many things. twenty minutes sure is a long time to write! that could also be because i'm not much of a writer. i used to like to write for fun, when i was younger, but being forced to do things makes me tend to not enjoy them as much. now, this is not so bad because i'm not worried about correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. , so i sure hope those things don't matter! i can't believe i waited until three hours before the due date to do this paper. actually, i can, i am such a procrastinator. i think it is the worst feature about myself. especially now in college, when there really is no time for procrastination. there always seems to be some sort of studying or reading i could be doing, but then again, there are a million other things that are just so much more appealing and at the time seem to be just as important as that homework! like for instance, it would almost be a sin to not see the final episode of my favorite tv show, or to miss out on what the rest of my friends are doing! only three other girls i went to high school with came to ut this year, and two of them live right across the hall! it's so strange how things work out. speaking of strange things, i saw a girl that i was best friends with when we were very young, like kindergarten through second grade! i couldn't believe we even recognized each other! it was so crazy! it was great to see her. then last night, i saw a boy that i went to junior high with, he actually lives on the same floor as me! i moved around a lot when i was younger, so the people i see, most likely don't even know each other! wow, i just looked up at the timer and it's already been more than fifteen minutes! that sure went by a lot faster than the first five! i wanted to go home this weekend, but i'm waiting until next, our town is having the county fair then. i don't want to admit that i miss home because i told everyone that i couldn't wait to leave! i was tired of the small town gossip and the close minded ideas of all those small town people! i do love it here in austin and i even have some family here, but i miss my parents! i think i might even miss my two younger brothers, now that's crazy! i think i just miss everything! i miss my kitty and i especially miss my best friend! he went to texas tech and i keep telling myself that i'll never see him again, but i pray that i will!

"my mind is totally blank right now. i am just happy that got in the computer lab and was able to use a computer without a long wait. i am kind of lost as to what to write. i am thinking about how much time i have to pass before my next class starts and i am wondering what to do to make the time go faster. i saw one of my friends from high school today. i am happy that i finally saw a familiar face. why is that light blinking on the cd-rom door? i did not put a cd in the drive. i hope i doing this assignment right. i want a new day planner. i am tired of looking at that nike symbol on mine. i want a leather one but my parents don't think i should $50 for a day planner, so oh well there goes that. i need to paint my fingernails. they are so plain looking. i think i might paint them tonight, oh no i can't. i have precal homework to do. i need go and have them painted and maybe i can treat my mom also. she needs to pamper herself. this chair is quite comfortable. i like how the back gives in when you lean back. i need this for my computer at home. there are a lot of dell computer boxes in the corner of this room. i wonder how many are there. i wonder if the mtv music awards are going to be good tonight. i missed the awards last year. i don't even who won. i hope its not raining right now or when i am ready to leave. my hair will frizz so bad and i'll have to blow-dry it out to make it smooth again. i wish i could where my hair naturally curly but its just too frizzy. my niece has the best hair and her mother doesn't take care of it. what are doors to side of this room for? where do they lead? my hands are cold. my feet are cold, too. i wonder if this shirt makes me look fat. the stripes are going horizontal. i need to start back to exercising like i used to. that boy is kinda cute who just walked by. my finger are really cold. the air conditioning must be up pretty high in here. i am always colder than most people. maybe i have small blood vessels in my hands and feet or something. i just can't get over how princess diana died. she seemed to be such nice person. what is this black cord wrapped around the bottom of the monitor? what is it used for? i am sleepy and i have another class to go to today. i hope i perk up. i 'e never seen a window button on a computer before but then i've never used a dell computer before either. how wide are the margins on this sheet. i'm try to keep my typing neat. i always like things to be neat and organized. my mind is blank again. i wonder what my mom is cooking today if she is cooking. my back is itching. i just realized that my legs are sore from that walking i did yesterday from the robert l. moore building all the way to calhoun hall in the six pack. my legs shouldn't be sore. i was a cheerleader in junior high and high school. my pen is coming out of my day planner. i never really fit right anyway. my day planner is kind of different. maybe i don't need another one. maybe i've been around my parents too long, but then my mom is my best friend. i tell her everything since i don't have a sister. my brother hasn't taken me to the movies in a long time. i wonder how he and his wife are doing. how do leave this computer lab. i guess the same way i got in. my handwriting is terrible. i hate having to write checks or sign my name. i just can't make my handwriting flow like some peoples. i think i drank too much sprite. all that ice might be making my hands and feet cold. i need to go and warm up. this air conditioning is really chilling me. i should paint my nails red like i have my toes. i need to go read for my ancient greek class. i haven't read the odyssey since the ninth grade. maybe i will understand it better this time. i only remember the cyclops. my hands are too cold. i need to warm up a bit.

" so i just read the asterix at the bottom of the screen about your social security number and it sounded like the most rediculous thing ever! i mean, obviously you don't want you ssn to be taken, but if youre telling carla you have to speak quietly?! so no one overhears you?! what the hell? i read it out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school, margaret and she said it was probably serious because our freshman english teacher in high school got her social security number stolen. i was sick this morning and i skipped all my classes. i don't know if i should write that because now maybe you think i'm a slacker. but i really felt like complete shit. i did go out last night til like 3, but i'm really snotty and coughing up phlegm. so last night when i got home, i had to walk home early because margaret felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird. so we came back and i was a little drunk and i called my ex from high school, but he's still my best friend and we talk all the time, jacob. it was so funny, he answered the phone- i was really surprised because he sleeps like a log, but he answered and sounded kind of awake so i asked him if i woke him up and he said no he was about to take a nap though. but i'm sure he was woken up. i really like him and i think i'll probably end up with him someday just because i can't picture ever having a friend i can confide in as much as him and i feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem. but i still get elated when he calls me and i love talking to him most of the time. i'm really excited because tonite i'm going to ka pledge line! with one of my friends from high school, daniel, a ka pledge. i can't decide if i should wear this black tube dress with a white ribbon on it or this black mock turtleneck dress thats a little bit longer and supertight. its very flattering, but it seems like guys always like strapless stuff and i have to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and a lot of guys like petite girls. i might go with that one anyway though because i have like a zit on my chest and it shows with the tube one. but i've met jeb bush a few times and i'm way starstruck with him and want to go on a date with him really bad just so i can say i could kind of, and he's kind of short. but i have a crush on this pothead (of course) i'm always attracted to that type (except jacob) who's tall and his name is clayton. i may just forget about jeb and go for the tall shoes. haha. so i've only been writing for 11 minutes 45 seconds! i have so much time left and i already feel like the most shallow girl ever- not to mention slacker for skipping class already. chandler, my suite mate and i are going to go to the ssb later and then-shopping!! you can never be too sick to shop. so right now i'm undeclared liberal arts and i was thinking about transferring to the business school and then i was like what the hell am i doing because i hate math and economics! so i dropped economics and added art history which i do like and decided to just stick with calculus-unfortunately. i got a 75 on my calculus homework yesterday. great a c already, that sucks ass. but i'm taking textiles-which sounds like another crap course but i'm really interested in fashion merchandising as a major. i want to be a buyer when i grow up or own a cute little clothes store. i think that would be a blast. but i told my dad i was taking textiles and he laughed his ass off for like 20 minutes and i mentioned fashion merchandising (but not like i was going to do it) and he would absolutely die and disown me if i majored in that. he was like you can still major in english and be a buyer. but i know he's going to tell the whole family i'm taking textiles and theyre all going to laugh at me and think i'm dumb, but whatever. textiles really is harder than some of my other classes like french (that you would think would be a really hard class). we have to memorize like 500 different kinds of fabrics and their properties. yikes. so i'm like aching right now and i really think i have west nile. chandler's brother's friend (in baton rouge) had to have his appendix out because they thought it was appendicitis, but he really had west nile. how much does that suck?! so i like ut ok right now, but from what i've heard everyone saying about the college experience being the best thing ever, i don't know so much right now. i can't imagine ever having friends as close as the ones i had in high school or meeting people as nice as the ones in baton rouge. louisiana people seem way nicer to me than texas people.

"i just got out of your class after watching the video and i was disappointed that i couldn't do a personality survey. i really wanted to do one. i like to find out things about myself that i might not have been aware of . yesterday i bought a postcard that had my horoscope sign and a description of the characteristics people of this sign have and i thought, as it usually turns out to be, that this card just about pin pointed a lot of the qualities that i have of course a few things were off the mark for goodness sake we are more complex than a few words that tell everyone born within a certain time span who they are, what they should be like, and what they would be good at. i'm really tired i wish i could fall asleep and not have to worry about any assignments. gosh we have to read for every class every day. i'm also taking sociology so a lot of the stuff in psy are the same, but obviously both sciences don't agree. i wonder how i'm going to keep all the facts straight. my soc teacher is boring cause he teaches straight from the book he makes me sleepy at 3:00 in the afternoon how is that possible? my other classes are cool because teachers teach from the book but insert their own ideas an anecedotes. which i like a lot. i wish i knew how to approach my professors and to just talk to them. i enjoy talking to people but classes this big don't really allow you to. i'm also intimidated by the professors for goodness sake we can no longer say miss or mr. now its dr. i am so not used to that. i feel so dumb and in awe by them. maybe that's why i can't figure out a way to approach them. one of my instructors on the first day of class called on me first and i was kind of sleepy and gave a partially correct and that sounded stupid and i heard people giggle. gosh i felt dumb. i still can't forget about it. it's like one of those experiences that everyone else forgets except you and you still think they remember. twenty minutes of writing is a lot of time but i just looked at my watch and i only have 3 minutes to go. i love psy. i love to give advice and find out people's personalities but ironically i'm not trying to pursue a career in that. maybe later i'll change my mind and do it who knows. all i want is to graduate but it's no longer like high school. now i'm not sure if i'm capable of succeeding. i want to succeed but with a's and without having to study so much. high school spoiled me got used to getting by with out studying. but now it's a whole new adventure.

"hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper. i hope you really really enjoy this one after all the other ones you have read. anyway right now i am really excited because i'm just about to go to the rage against the machine concert. i'm hoping that i have a blast and i know i will. my brother and a lot of my friends came up for this concert. so, i will be able to see them. ain't that the greatest thing. earlier today, i was wishing that i could fly. the reason for that is that we were stuck in traffic. just think about it, just flying through the air, your hair flying back, brushing across your face--but i guess if we could fly, we wouldn't think that much about it. yesterday, i got an e-mail from my sister. it was really cool and all, and she should come visit me soon. my sister is the one person in my family that i really enjoy--but enough about that. i'm going to a concert, and to party! oh, just to throw something in here. i was noticing that many people here get really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the morning. i think this is really hilarious because i come from laredo, texas. that is a border-town to mexico (not that it could be canada in texas). well, we have clubs and discos in mexico that are just a few minutes away so i'm use to going out, staying out late, and drinking. therefore, i came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have fun during their high school years--whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves. that is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in ut, and why a lot of students struggle just to pass. i hope pass all my classes with a's if possible. i'm planning to be a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and i kind of need a great gpa to get into med school. oh by the way, i want to clear up the reason why i want to be that kind of a surgeon. many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money. some people don't even consider doctors as real doctors. they are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay young and beautiful. although plastic surgeons may do this, they help build up the self-esteem of the patient. there are some people who were born with defects or were in a really bad accident, plastic'reconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again. most people with some type of defect usually have a low self-esteem. therefore, they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people. plastic'reconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world. they feel better about themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is improved. this is vital to the survival of the individual--for without it there is nothing to live for. well, i'm going now hope i didn't bore you too much! :> ",0
"i'm really behind in school work right now. i have been working so much that i have put school work aside. i have a lot of things to buy and not enough money for everything. i'm wondering if i really need to buy a mask for my scuba class. that means i would have to invest ninety bucks in a mask and at least twenty for the snorkel. another thing that makes me really mad is that i just bought those flip-flops today and somebody stole them. that makes me so mad, it's like nobody has any integrity anymore. i don't understand every time i find something in a store i always turn it in. that's the way i would like for my things to handled if i left them. it just makes me mad. sure, they were on a super sale for ten bucks, but still, that is not the point. i wonder where my honey is at. oh yeah he had a flight meeting to attend. i wonder when he'll be back. it's already nine. okay, let's think, what do i have to do tonight. i have to finish up my economics homework, gosh i have to get at least a b in that class. i also have to get a good grade in this psych class. i wonder who's right outside, they sure are making a lot of noise. oh yeah, i have to do good in this class because i need it for my sequence to apply to the school. so i have to finish up this homework and then do eco. i'm glad i don't have to worry about digging up all the answers since i already found a bunch of them. i have to read for social work and i need to go and buy the sports package. i need to find out what time i have to be at work on wednesday evening. i don't think my boss understands that my class doesn't let out until five and she wants me at work by five thirty, she's crazy. gee, i'm really thirsty. gosh, i have got to get back into homework. i have a test in sw on the 22. i have so much reading. i hate reading especially about research stuff. i think the only reason i'm caught up in psych is because most of the reading is pretty interesting and so is the prof. and economics, i guess i'm just afraid to fall behind in that class. so my goal for the evening will be to get all this psych stuff done and economics and get through the chapter in social work. that shouldn't be too hard. i kind of like that jason isn't home but i'm getting worried about him. if he were here then i probably wouldn't' be getting this done. on the other hand he has plenty of physics and calc to do also so i guess we'll both be getting school work taken care of tonight. i'm so excited that i'll get to go to one of the football games this year. at least i'll feel like a normal college student for a day. i wonder how that slip that i just bought fits. i have yet to try it on. i bet jason will love it but he will just have to wait. gosh, i'm hungry. what did i eat today, oh yeah i ate chinese. i really have to get in touch with bob. i feel so bad that i haven't contacted him. i need to extend my condolences to his family. i bet his poor mother must be miserable without her husband. i don't know what i would ever do if i lost jason, that's because we're not even married.

"throughout my life i have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future. for example, when first arriving at ut i was awe-inspired by the size of the campus, and the enormous amounts of students which attended. i was shocked by the different races which represented each other. i could tell that everyone was already forming their own little """"clicks"""", whether it was based on their interests in music, race, sex, sexual orientation, everyone was already making new friends, and social gathering were taking place. while everyone was socializing i was busy worrying about the classes that i was taking, the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that i had. i was lonely, i was scared, and being from a large city, i was trying to adapt to an even larger one. although ut is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things, for example, the opposite sex,new friends, and just having a good time, while at the same time, studying. i knew coming to ut that i would have a good education, but i needed a way to find myself, who i was, and what i wanted to study, i came to ut wanting to be a doctor, but i figured that it may not be something i wanted to do. perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy, at some time in my college education, but whatever it is that i may become i want it to be something that i am going to be happy doing. i realized that high school is much different that college. college is much more demanding, and time consuming. but in the end it will even out someday. when i was a child i had dreams of being a great military leader. a policeman. a astronaut. or a physicist. as of now i don't know what i want to become i'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly. as a child i always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why i wanted to become a doctor. but now that i'm in psychology i've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind. but how it works and functions. in science i have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others. for example in psychology, it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression. or just find a way to make everyone happy, in the event that i would someday accomplish something like this, i would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle. knowing that i have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day. now that i am more relaxed here at ut it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster. finding the shortcuts. and finding which classes are the best. all the time when i first discovered what comes along with a great education. i have also figured out that i can become whatever i want to be. just as long as i put my mind to it. and test out my skills as a academian. coming to ut i knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me. i knew that with hard work and determination. i could accomplish whatever i wanted to. conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine. overpowering myself, knowing that i can't always tell myself what to do all the time. and just let my unconscious mind take over. often times when i become depressed i find that it is easier to listen to soothing music. talking with a friend. or playing chess with a friend. or playing cards with them. at times i just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily. when i do find myself depressed i always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind. and think about other things. such as playing basketball. playing baseball. or like i said playing a good game of chess with my friends. i havent quite yet found my niche at ut but it will come someday. and i too will find my interests in academics. and find something that i truly love doing. whether it be my major now. such as biology or even psychology. as a kid i remember pouring through my fathers materials. because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments. and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature. all along i thought i always knew what i wanted to do when i got older but i guess its an answer i will learn in time. ???

"i really have no idea what to write about. i am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. it feels like i have just been on vacation and am home now. some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but i took some allergy medicine and i have no desire to dance. the medicine makes me so tired. my dad is very upset with my cat because while i have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. she only does that when she is upset about something. i guess she misses me. we used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. she was a wonderful dog. i am bringing my fish back with me when i go back to austin tomorrow. that is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. i had to sell my horse before i left for college. i had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. i still haven't sold all of my equipment. i can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. princess diana died in a car accident this morning. i really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but i guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. anyway, i think it is really really sad. i especially feel so bad for her children. i was watching 60 minutes on tv a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. my brothers and i used to fish a lot with the family too. it is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. one of them is 22 and the other one is almost 26. that is hard to believe. i just turned 18 on friday. it was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. i am also glad i came home because that way, i can be sure that i keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. i want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. i am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. i think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. i went to camp texas at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where i used to live in houston. she told me that a girl i used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. it was so shocking and really sad. i mean, i didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since i had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. my roommate at towers is really cool. i am glad we get along. i was worried i might get some freak. i can just imagine that if i had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than i thought it would be. i think i still have a few minutes left. i think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. sometimes they are really, really loud. we used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. it was in the middle of the night and i heard her running around the house like a freak. finally i got up to see what was wrong and i took the trap off of her. the mouse appeared to be dead so i put it in a baggy but when i got up in the morning, i found out it was still alive so i tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so i put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. it finally got better so i let it go. i had to let it go far away from my house though because my mom was afraid it would come back in. my cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in houston. it was so sad. i cried everyday until we finally found her again. i think my twenty minutes is up now.

"yeah so i am so stressed right now and i am wishing that i wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress. i could get fat!!! i don't want to be fat. i mean i know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! right?!?!? but i am trying to run a lot!!!! that way, i can burn stress and burn calories. extra calories!!! i am having a hard time not getting irritated when i eat a lot. that's weird huh!? that it's when i am hungry that i'm not most irritable. hmmmm well today when i went running, i realized that i should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when i'm tight. and get this! i've lost 5 lbs since i got to school. but how?!?!? i've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! oh well. still i was kind of excited! but i am mad that i haven't started my period yet. my mood swings are terrible and so are again. my eating patterns! and that's when i find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something i don't like. spanish!!! ugh! i want to move to spain and learn it by living with people who speak it! but i really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows english so she is slow to interpret and yet teach. does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh i've heard that word before. and oh i know what it means! poof! i mean we have to learn something before we can know it. did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her mother's womb. no! she was pottied trained. right! well my high school spanish teacher was horrible and i had the worst experience with that . while i got a great grade, i didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! i mean i am glad i got an a but she didn't prepare me for ut where my prof speaks in spanish all the time. not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! would i say to a baby. ok this is how you open your mouth. open it open it. do you know what i am saying?!?! it kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak english well. they aren't trying to be mean but they may say """"hey how are you"""" really loudly and you're like """"dude, they aren't deaf! they just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone"""" right?!?! grr. so i feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like """"man this girl is so negative!"""" golly, i am right now because i see my spanish prof everyday! like i said before. so yeah! uhhhhh well i am excited about this weekend but at the same time i keep thinking of how behind i am compared to everyone else here at ut, intellectually and academically! i mean i feel so insignificant some times. however i know where i get my wisdom from and that is jesus christ who makes my knowing god possible! he saved me from the depths of hell! and even after doubting him so much and having to research jesus' life and creation and all that. i have found that he is the one . he is my sufficiency! i mean who knows more than the god of the universe, the creator of the heavens and i am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually! i mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the god that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) there is just so much opposition to him right now. i mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death. well actually god let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but i just want everyone else to know his love and i really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a """"bible beating"""" manner but just to love them through how i treat them. hopefully. i wasn't too negative for . you know what i'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this. please look for jesus with the pre_suppositions that he doesn't exist. expect to find him and i know you will! to his glory alone!

so retarded. i really like the song. damn i have to go to the bath room and its only been like 3 minutes porbaqbly less, there i dammit go again, can't type. uggghhh the stupid computer guy didnt call back about my computer, stupid flirt oh yeah he can flirt and try and act all cool with me and my roommate but can't even get my computer back before my assignment is due. i hate using other peoples computers it just doenst feel the same and i really don't like typing on lap tops. i like my computer, it feel comfortable, i feel so weird at my own personal computer in college doing college stuff. although i am reall glad i don't have to write any papers. i'm pretty damn good at writting but i hate the effort that you have to put into it. my papers have to be perfect, each word percisely chosen, but then that is the point of most papers i mean all the really good writters specifically choose they're words to convey a point. i really have to go to the bathroom, but my god damn roommate has a guy over and the bathroom is right next to her room, i mean how akward is that. i have a problem going when its just girls. i have a dg meeting no a retreat at five 15 can't wait i really am beginnig to like being a dg although i don't know where ill get the money to pay for this but i worry about that later, i always get around things that i want, although i didnt get into the sor that i wanted i mean out of 5 i didn't get either, i just didnt realize how incredibly hard is is to get into the good ones, i just wish i knew why i was rejected at some of them. and i am really really bothered by the fact that this is so final i mean for life, i can't go back and try to fix things or change things. that's what's really bothering me, i can't seem to be in charge. i really wanted to be on crew really bad, i looks so fun and i love water, but the practices are so early i mean 5 and 6 in the morning, that's like the middle of the night for me. i got home at 2 and would have only got 3 hours of sleep if i wanted to go to try outs, and since i can't go to the practice tomarrow i am pretty sure thqat i can't do it, there's always next year, i guess its all for the best, i mean i will have a chance to get my footing and get adjusted, i don't want to be to heavily involved my first semester and being in a sorority takes up so much of my time. god i just really want to meet some hot guy and make really close friends, i know i'm supposed to give it time but i have been so severly disappointed since i have been here. i didnt get the chance i wanted to be in the in the really cool top sors and live-- had to go to the bathroom much better. i guess i'm happy i mean i just have such high expectations for myself, ilways want to appear to very cool to everyone else, i guess other's opinions really do matter and i know that isn't what is going to make me happy yes like with jas. jazz i really fucked up that one, all i could think was will i be cooll with this guy next year, not if i was happy or if i liked him as a person and when i realized what he meant to me it was too late. and then there's also the fact that after we got in that little fight i cuouldnt do anything about it. just wait for him to call or not call, i couldnt fix it. even after i went down there i wanted to make him see i was sorry and that i could be and was everything he wanted. i can get so messed up sometimes. i don't give people a chance because i don't perceive them as what other's would perceive as cool soes that make sense well to me it does. why am i so obsessed with society standards, i guess that 's i why i have never really be that happy or had a really super good best friend. to worried about what other people will think or say when they see me. i want to be proud like all the other girls and i don't see why they get to have everything. i mean they can be cold hearted bitches an dback stabbers, everything bad, but they'll have popularity, hot guys tons of people dying to be their friends, but me typically very nive and loyal doesn't ever get any of that, or maybe i do but just not they way i want. i always want what other people have or i can't get. more writting but i kkinda ran out of topics running why do i have to run so much and eat so little i'm mean i have a serious problem with wieght gain, i can't loose the pounds and i seriously feel like cruying because my legs are so thick. i mean i work out and i'm trying to more and have seriously cut back on my this song sucks how much longer, i guess its ok i don't want to take off my ursuline ring its part of who i am, i think its cute that i still wear it. i had a good time at ursuline it was only this summer that i got dicked over. i don't know what the deal is with andrea but the has some serious issues, she needs to grow up or get a life. i mean she just takes me for granted so much and now she's doing it to my roommate and i don't like it, i thought for once i would be able to get heroutof my life but it doesn't look that way, its like she doenst respect my friendship at all, she really doenst respect anyone, she is a conceited spoiled brat. i need to brush my teeth oh hey look i'm done ",1
"as i sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. it has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. ut is the perfect place for me. the diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that i chose to come here. although i am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. today, one year after 9'11'01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. i cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. how will the families of the victims ever heal? my family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and i know my mom still cries at night. that sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on september 11. i cannot even contemplate their pain. i saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and i know this tradegy affected people in different ways. well, september 11 is a day that i will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. however, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. it is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the united states will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.

"i'm sitting here listening to a trance cd of jimmy van m who i recently saw at hyperia in houston, texas. as best as i can express my sensations and reactions to this music something will always be left unsaid. the music is a magical, emotional journey that not many people understand. those that do, however, are purveyors of another plain of consciousness that will forever stay with them. a grammatical explanation is hard to find when most people are entirely withheld from experiences that have the guaranteed potential to alter people's lives. i often think of teddy roosevelt's idea. """"far better it is to dare mighty things than to take rank with those poor timid spirits who know neither victory or defeat. """" i for one am a great example of the power that is contained in some of the things i've experienced. i wish i could really delve into these things sometimes without hesitating with regards to the repercussions. but, then again, the leap of faith is something everyone must do on their own. someone can only be shown the door. you must have the initiative within to step across it on your own. as much as i've seen and endured i sometimes wonder if i really have seen everything that is the best. then i remember what i thought before my experiences and i know that there is still so much more out there for me to jump on. avoiding selfdestruction is also a daunting task sometimes and an everpresent one. one i am no longer fearful of fulfilling. life really is too short to worry a fraction as much as most people do. this is a cold, hard fact. i'll be damned if i'll be lying on my deathbed reminiscing about all the missed opportunities. i'll croak knowing that i choked everything out of life and then some, and then a little more.

"9:55. 20 minutes. time? why did i wait so loong to do this? well i didnt know about it until thursday, but still, what happened friday? oh yeah, i slept i think or maybe not it seems so far away. i guess its worth waiting since i got to see elise. god i sometimes feel like we are in competition and i keep reminding myself that it can't be like that. of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. i wonder why i have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since i've been here. elise i can kind of see because she is older and attractive but i would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. god i need to loose weight. why did she think i didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell i had? maybe she feels threatened like i do. i bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. i kind of want to skip the greek festivle because i am afraid. i'm afraid of being the odd one out. ok obviously i willl be like the only non greek. niko,. how i wish i was greek or smatter sometimes. i miss feeling loved. i miss feeling strong and powerful. although i do feel that way here sometimes. texas just isn't right for my balance i think. then again this is an emotional time of the month. but no i have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. i gues sits good to face, but at the same time i just want to crawl back home to paris. will i always think of it as home i wonder. god, sometimes the future is hopless. dear god, why do i sometimes feel this desperate? i know there are a lot of things i have done wrong, but i also know that i have been forgiven. lord, i love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which i can get to a church so that i can get the spiritual nourishment i need. i am starting to feel drained'. my father, jesus christ, please help me to help elise. help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. lord i pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. christ jesus please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. after vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. please help remind me not to give up, that mistakes are just that nad that i neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. lord jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because i know i don't have it. please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. lord i pray for jules. my heart is breaking for him because i love him so much. the thought of him tears me apart lord. i know that everything happens for a reason and that i am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when i see it and to embrace it willingly as i believe i do now. lord please continue to work in the life of jules. help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. help him to understand how i know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that i am able to experience any time. give him peace lord jesus from whatever may torture his mind. help eric and kate to find the same things too. to be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time? 10:16.

"i've always wondered how the mind works. what are people really thinking when they say one thing. why do they say one thing and mean another? people can be so confusing. i wonder what college life will be like, and if there will be people there who will act like that and just say one thing to me while meaning another. it's all so overwhelming right now. computers have never been my strong point, and all of a sudden, everyone wants everything done on a computer. it's strange and somewhat exciting. i like living out on my own, without my parents watching over everything i do, but i am beginning to get a little homesick. i miss being able to see the stars at night and to feel the breeze on my face as it blows my hair back off of my neck. i went to a star party last night, and the stars were barely visible. i wanted so much to be able to see them, but i couldn't. i felt like i could cry at that moment. i didn't though, because then my friend would laugh at me. he doesn't think i'll make it here on my own. i guess i am somewhat of a daddy's girl, but i can be alone. i enjoy being able to hear myself sometimes. i have to be alone to write poetry and to think about who i am. i wonder when i'll figure myself out. i want to be somebody important someday. i want to make other people feel welcome and to make myself feel good about helping others. i guess in a way, whenever i try to make others feel good about themselves, i'm doing it with the underlying purpose of making myself feel good. i suppose that's okay, but it seems to defeat the purpose of helping others when all i'm really accomplishing is helping myself. i think life has so many hidden points that no one will ever find all of them. i wish i could search the world over until i could find all the secrets of the history of people's actions, but that will never happen. people are so secretive that so much history is lost. there are some people that claim that it can be found, but there's got to be more exciting history out there. what would the world be like if everything interesting was discovered. then there would be nothing to wonder about. things would be dull for the future. i wonder if somebody across the world is taking this exact same course and writing this exact assignment right now as i'm doing. that would be the coolest thing ever. i wish on stars every night and feel that life is to be cherished. i wonder if there is another woman out there with my exact feelings and thoughts, that looks exactly like me, only another color maybe or size. so many questions i ask myself will never be answered, but what if someone is watching me right now across this computer lab and wondering how i feel and what i'm thinking at this very moment. if only i knew, maybe i could meet up with this person and tell him'her my thoughts. i would love to share with someone i don't know. i'm afraid of rejection though. there are so many people on this campus, and hardly anyone has talked to me yet. somehow i feel inferior to some of them. i don't know why. everyone is equal, but some people seem so rude. i try to talk to people in my class, because that is how you make friends. so far, i have only made one friend that way. she's really nice. her name is christen. i met her in my german class, and we get along really well. we haven't done anything outside of class, but maybe if we keep talking to each other, we'll become closer and maybe she'll even go home with me to visit my parents. i don't understand the need for human contact. we would be so much better off if we didn't get caught up in emotions and feelings. but then again, we wouldn't be human if that didn't happen. i know i could be more efficient if i didn't need anyone else in the world, but as it is, i have faults. that's okay, though. everyone has faults. it's just part of being human. i hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me. as i come to a close on my writing, i feel purged of all my frustrations. i had a good cry this afternoon. i miss my boyfriend so much, but i know i'll see him again soon, and that makes me very happy. i hope i can become even happier with where i am now. hopefully, i'll be able to find me.

"ok, 20 minutes. to start off, i should probably write a little longer than 20 minutes. if i only write for 20 minutes, you're not going to get very much. that's because my typing skills are way below even pitiful, much less below average. the reason for that is that i'm twice as old as most of the rest of the students in this class, and consequently did not grow up using a computer as they did. as a matter of fact, there weren't any computers at all in my high school. the only computers that the entire school district had were the ones that counted holes in punch cards. i took all my first standardized tests by punching holes in cards. those were probably the only computers in the entire city. wait, that's not true; some of the most advanced computers in the entire world were probably there. i grew up in amarillo, which is where the pantex plant is located. pantex(although they'll never admit it, it's common knowledge) is the final assembly point for all the nuclear weapons for the united states. just a wild guess, but they probably had some pretty cool computers out there. what else? oh, i hope i can just write this here and hit submit, because being technostupid, i don't have a clue as to how to do any of that cutandpaste black magic. as a precautionary measure, i'm going to print it up. if it doesn't go through, i'll have to paper your office with printed copies and bother you with emails. ok, how long has it been? 14 minutes. my guess is that after 14 minutes, most of those folks will have come up with with 20 times what i have here. i hear them over in the computer center at the ugl with their flying fingers. damned showoffs. but enough about me. tell me about yourself. never mind. bad joke the next thing that pops up sort of relates to that first stuff. what in the hell is an old fart like me doing in a university in the first place? well, i really, really screwed it up the first time. i couldn't be bothered to go to class back then; i had dope to deal. well, it was the early 70s, there was a lot of that going on. so when i got fed up and pissed off in the job i had, i decided to look for a new job. being tired of the whole restaurant business, i looked through the entire classified section, only to find that everyone wanted you to have a degree. it didn't have to have anything to do with what they did, they just wanted you to have one. the ad that tore it for me was for some retail place in the mall, i can't even remember which one, listed only 2 qualifications: a college degree, and the ability to lift 25 pounds. @#%$&&^%! so here i am. now it's 23 minutes. see what i mean? i just did a quick division since that last timecheck and using the number of lines, it comes to about 1820 words a minute. i'm surprised the keyboard's not smoking. i'll go on for a couple of minutes more here. you probably haven't had nearly enough boring stuff to read today. now i'm stretching to find things to say. was that the point of this deal? to prove that more than 20 minutes of sustained thought was too much to sustain? if so i've more than proved the point here. even 20(well, getting close to 30 now) has proved to be a stretch. enough. i'm sending this thing. i hope you get it.

"and so know i begin my first assignment in psychology. i don't know exactly how to begin this but i'm giving it my best shot. typing isn't my forte so this is going pretty slowly. my roommate just walked in and then right out as soon as i told him what i was doing. wow, there's something on the screen besides solitaire! he must be thinking. i hope my computer gets fixed soon. it'll be so much easier being able to send this through the internet from my dorm rather than going to the smf lab and waiting for an open computer. they should have come to fix it by now. i guess they have a lot of people to help considering that i've called them two or three times already. and when the ethernet starts working that will be awesome. lightning fast access; no more waiting and waiting and waiting. . at least the phone lines are up and running ( in my room anyway). and not only that i got two free phone cards on the street today. i love it when they just hand out free stuff! uh oh, i just heard some cars screeching outside but i can't see anything from my window. i hope they're o. k. i can't leave this keyboard! hmmmmm, i just got writer's block and i'm writing through my stream of consciousness. i wonder if that's bad. i just got a song in my head but it's not like i can write down the notes ( it's instrumental ). my gum is losing its taste, i think that i might need a new piece soon. it's winterfresh gum. it's my favorite. i don't exactly know why it's my favorite gum, but maybe i'll find out in this psychology class. psychology is a kind of hard word to type and it takes a little longer that some of the other words. my roommate just turned on some music. its called prodigy, the group that is, and they play electronic music. it sounds pretty cool, i think i'll go listen to it.

"how should i start this? writing about my thoughts and feelings is kind of difficult when asked to put them down into words. i mean, i think about things all the time especially when i am walking to class or trying to go to sleep. right now i am at my friend desiree's house and i am doing this assignment because i have not done any homework tonight, and i feel like i need to do something before i go to sleep. desiree is so great! she is my best friend up here in austin. when i think about how we met(we met in chicago at a youth leadership forum the summer after our junior year of high school) and that we both came to u. t. , it astonishes me how fate works. i am a firm believer in fate. my mom always worries about me getting killed in a car accident or getting attacked or something, but i always tell her that a meteor could come through my ceiling at ten o'clock at night and kill me if god wants me dead. there is no stopping fate. but then again, maybe i put too much trust into fate. i always think that things happen for a reason and that if something is meant to be, it will happen. i think that is a good thing to believe. it gives you a positive outlook on life. when something bad happens, i always remind myself that it happened for a reason. this sort of thinking really helps me get over stuff. i bet that everyone who does this assignment ends up talking about love. i think that love and relationships are always on people's minds. i know that i think about it often. wondering what my future husband is doing right now at this very minute or thinking about some guy that i like. i don't have a boyfriend in austin right now, but in some ways i'm glad that i don't. i find that when i like a guy i end up thinking about him in class instead of paying attention to the class. that can really get me into trouble. who knows? i really need to do well this semester. i am shooting for a 4. 0! i think that getting a 4. 0 would be awesome, and i am going to do it! i want to do it at least once before i graduate from college. that is one of my goals. that may sound kind of sad, but i really want to just to show everyone that i am here and i got a 4. 0. even if it is only once, i want to do it. well, my twenty minutes is up and i really need to get some sleep so i can work on getting that 4. 0 gpa. it was nice talking to ya whoever you are.

"i just always feel like i am better off when i get things done. i have found that i have been procrastinating a lot lately and i just want to get things back into order so i can do more fun things. i was happy about passing by the ut tennis club booth on my way back from class, i am hoping to have time to do that. i really wish i talked to the ut tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do i like tennis, but i am happy bec it will give me a workout. i don't have much time to go to the gym now and i really want to work out more often. i picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe i will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying i have to do takes up more time than expected, i just feel like i don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight i had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and i just wanted to leave so i could do more imprt things with my time. but i know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec i will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when i went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now i am worried i wont get a spot in a study and i will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since i already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. i will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since i am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then i will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, i should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time i got to register, since i was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. i should have come to an earlier one but i didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so i had to go to the later one, oh well. at least i got classes that are required, i can't get everything i suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone i know, from my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and i kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though i do miss pewople a lot, i think i am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since i was accepted, i felt like it was a good opportunity and i shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why i came all the way from miami, florida to texas and i always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. i was just admiring today the fountains - i love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that i have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where i live. those people scare me, and i know i have nothing to be scared of i just don't like seeing them there. anyway, i am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. i hope they have a great trip an safe. i am always worried abt them, i just don't want anything to happen to them. i know my mom is scared of flying and i just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that i got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever i think abt that trip i think abt how i wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips i still did it, i guess i thought they wouldnt care if i did it. that's funny. i guess i am still bitter i didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but i am happy at ut. i hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 50 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 80 - i love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. i miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but i havent gotten it yet, i should call her. but i havent talked to her inso long i think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe i will one day, i guess i should to say thank you when the present comes. or i could send a card, whatever. i will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 20 minutes is up and i would like to write more but, like i said before, so much to do and so little time. i still ahve to read a million and two pages and i only have 2 classes tomorrow. i just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun!

" today is september 11, 2002. exactly one year since the attack on the twin towers, the attack on our country occured. today is a day of sorrow, of mourning, but also a day of pride. as i watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others i was deeply touched. atfirst i was sad as i thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind. but know, as i have watched as our country has come together, i am extremely proud. i remember at this time last year, american pride was so awesome all across the country. people had their flags out and people just helped each other. people began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country. today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation, and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process. i can remember exactly where i was when the second plane crashed. i was in my creative writing class and a girl, emily momburger, walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers. my teacher turned on the tv and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing. and then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes. we were in shock and i remember i got the chills. i think that i will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me. i remember watching the news as people cried through the streets holding pictures of their loved ones, looking desperately for them all over, just hoping that they weren't in the crash. today, is a day of remembering though and also a day of forgetting, trying to go on with our daily lives and overcome the terrorism that has overtaken our country. college life besides the horrific event that we are remembering is going well. i joined tridelt and am in the greek system. at first i didn't really want to be a tridelt and was disappointed, but now i am really happy. our pledge class is so amazing and a lot of the girls in it are really cool. we participated in this field day event last saturday and it was really fun. i got to know a lot of the girls better and we bonded. we also went on our pledge retreat that night as well which was a good experience. we were all really exausted but we tried to socialize and get to know each other. last night i went to this praise and worship thing called escape. it was at this guys house and there were so many people there. usually there aren't that many people who go, but last night so many came that we had to go in the backyard. it was awesome even our in the heat. it was so reassuring to see that there are other christians on this campus and i felt very close to the lord there in that backyard with complete strangers and the dog barking in the background. it is so easy to lose focus here on theis campus, and last night was so helpful for me to really remember what is really important in this life. i sometimes feel myself getting lost in school and in sorority and greek life, that i'm like i just don't have enough time for my quit times. the fact of the matter is, he should be my number one prioroty, and l;ately he hasn't been. i am working on it though, and we just have to do the best we can. but, i am really excited to be here more and more each and every day. i am meeting so many new people and having so much fun with the old friends that i came here with. we just do th ",1

"""" so i unplugged it and let the battery run out. computers are so stupid. but i guess we couldn't live without them. i really hope i don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow. i'm really nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that i don't completely understand. my roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the pcl--she calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--i don't know how she does it!! studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like i need a break--she stays there for hours!! she's really sweet though. i so happy i got good roommates (yes--that's plural--i have 3 roommates--i'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as i thought it would be) 2 of my roommates are really nice. the other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's always at her boyfriend's house. that's kind of rude to her parents though--i mean--they're paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here. the only thing i know about her is her name really. that's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time anymore. when we first moved in she didn't have a ethernet cord so i said she could do her add'drops on my pc. but then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on my printer--with my ink) so at least that's not happening any more. andy roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the us open tonight. that made me so sad--i love andy roddick--he has to be the sexiest guy ever! i met him last year and the tennis masters series in houston and he signed my shirt--me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled out andy--he and his coach really liked them!! but i really wanted him to win--he won the open last year and that was his first so i really wanted him to defend it. oh well. the guy he lost to was playing really good. he played the same type of game as andy though. they were calling him a swedish andy roddick, but he'll never be andy roddick--he wasn't cute enough. chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester. i'm not really sure if i want to major in biology any more. i think it might just be too much science for me. i thought i could handle it, but i just don't know anymore. i know majoring in biology will probably help me make a good score on the mcat, though. i really want to get into med school. i want to be a pediatrician. it's just so much school though. oy! but i think it'll pay off. i really want to do something with kids and i could do that and make money at the same time. i mean--it's that or teaching right? and teaching is definitely not on my list of things i want to do. my mom is a teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve! she works all the time--sometimes she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 5th and 6th graders. i mean--it's probably worse with older kids right? i don't know--i just couldn't handle it--i'd feel like i deserved more. chemistry time.

". it's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. currently i'm ecstatic because i just found out that my soccer team may be going to clemson college and that is where my best friend, kristen mckinney is going to school. i miss her so much! when i think of her i never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that god brought her into my life. with my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend i have ever had. i had so much trust in her, that many times i found myself dependent on her when i needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. i remember a time when i was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how i felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. immediately after i left i drove two blocks to kristen's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. people say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but i know that the friendship kristen and i have can't get much more intimate than ours. through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. that's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. although i miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because i am confident that god has prosperous plans for me at ut and kristen at clemson. also this will each me to become completely dependent on christ and his promises and not on fleeting things of this world. i really hope that i will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. already i find myself not making time to be in the word, which is the armor i need to remain strong against the enemy. i can relate with paul who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. but glory be to god who makes me free of guilt through jesus. why he chose me, i have no idea. my mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny chris farly lines or petty worries of the day. already i am thinking of other assignments i need to complete after this and of how i need to get in touch with certain people. yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to god, and i have such trouble letting christ shine out of me when i am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. lord, please make me a bondservant to serve you daily on this campus or where ever i am and who ever i run into.

"i hate driving in austin. there is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. people are so impolite when it comes to cars. jay just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. and now i have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. my mom didn't want me to take it with me. i hope the body shop does a good job. that is my main concern. i had a headache this morning. i think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. my roommate was being nice to me this morning. jerry told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. and boys are so much trouble. why does sak always have to do this to me? i think i will finally answer his question truthfully now. i thought i had been, but he was right, i'm still hiding something. i don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what i want. and then he says not to want anything. why must he always try to be the good guy? i don't know if he is telling me the truth. if he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? this boy is driving me nuts. i don't understand why he keeps doing this. deep down, i think i know the answer. but i guess i hide from things a lot. people always say i hide myself. sak says i hide myself in questions. i do. i never answer personal questions. i answer them with questions. i don't know why. maybe i do need a psychiatrist. i think too much. i think i scare sak. because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. i don't like her. she doesn't like me either. i've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. she looks at me funny. i think she's stringing him along. that's why he does this to me. but then he told me i was wrong. he said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. i think it scares him to let himself go. for some reason i think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. he saw through me hiding behind questions. but i think it's because i don't doubt him. i trust his opinions and his thoughts. that's something i don't do with most people. i trust him. which surprised me. it usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. maybe because i am always hiding. for some reason i think he has the key to unlock whatever it is i am hiding. and i think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that i can't open myself. that's what i want, i guess. i want to tell him the truth but i can't. because like him. i am hiding. we're both hiding. only he does a better job at it. probably because he is a guy. why do i trust him? i don't understand that. but sometimes i think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. why do i trust him so much? i think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. i remember when i first met him; i was not attracted to him. he looked cunning to me. like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. but then i think he also has the heart not to. that's why i think i started to like him. he has a good heart. and i think that's one quality that is hard to find. oh my gosh! i guess this answers his question of what i think about him. i think i will give him a copy of this one day? i will tell him the truth. the entire truth of what i thought when i first met him until now. but i also want him to tell me too. because i don't want to be the only one who opens up. but i don't think that will ever happen. i think my twenty minutes is about to be up. and i have such a bad memory; i don't remember anyone's name. i feel so bad. why can't i remember? that's unfair to me because people know who i am but i have no idea who they are. i need to work on my memory.

my duty is to get a date tonight for friday when we have our mixer that is 70's based. i am looking forward to meeting some more girls than i already know. i believe that this stuff is fun whether or not it takes a whole lot of my time. although i have not had enough time to work out as much as i would like. i feel as though i am losing some muscle tone. the food at towers does not help with the dirth of a suitable protein source the food is extremely inedible i have a very hard time consuming enough food to keep my normal body weight up. at dinner i usually eat with either my pledge brothers or my roommates. my roommates are nice guys even if my suite mates are afraid of girls and this hampers our activities. i have a large amount of laundry to do but really do not feel like doing it. i have to acquire red wing boots by tomorrow or my team will lose the game. school is strange because i am never sure if i have done all my work or if i need to study some stuff more it is hard to judge how much you need to study when you have never taken a college test before. i reckon the tests will be fairly challenging although i think my high school prepared me well for these tests. i need to ask a date to the rice football game but i am not sure just who to ask. the football games are cool although my ticket at the first game had my on the highest row possible. i think ricky williams is good although he is not as good as jamal williams of tennessee. i think texas will lose by a large margin to ucla then they will get stomped by kansas state. we will finally win at rice but then we will win at the other teams i think although the schedule is a mystery. i can't wait to go home to memphis at thanksgiving to see all my friends. and my freaking car. i wish i could play more basketball and release my athletic energies. ,0
"i don't know why, but for some reason i am extremely nervous about this writing assignment. it most likely won't even be read! random, but i started thinking about what an awful driver i am in austin. all of the one way streets and stop signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. i've already ran two red lights. whoops. since this writing assignment is online, i can't help but read the instant messages that pop up while i'm typing. i love talking to people online, i think i'm addicted. it really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family now that we are all living in different cities. especially since two of my best friends are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, i can talk to them all at the same time. it is very convenient. since coming to college i have become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. tomorrow night the sig eps are having an 80's theme party, so last night i spent about an hour downloading hit songs from the 80's. my friends and i are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. it will be awesome. today my friend melanie and i went shopping at thrift stores to find 80's garb. i found the best 80's pumps for only six dollars. can you say jackpot? i think my favorite 80's song right now has to be jessie's girl by rick springstein. i wish i was jessie's girl, because then i would date his best friend. speaking of dating, i think dating in college is going to be rather difficult considering there are approximately 50 gorgeous girls on campus to every one attractive guy. not that looks are everything, but that is what generally draws two people together to start talking. actually i think that is usually the case, but i am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the attractive hard asses. racquetball is my new favorite sport. i have played five times since i've been here. it's really the best work out. it's so much better than running for 20 minutes. just play racquetball for 45 minutes and you can't breath. it's such a great feeling. i have had a few complaints though, because i tend to accidentally hit the person i am playing with a little too often than necessary. i've hit my sister like twice and i couldn't even guess how many times i've hit christy. whoops! i love going to concerts. they are probably on my top 5 favorite things to do list, along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. i wish we had some snow nearby, but i would hate to live in the cold so i guess i don't really want snow close by. i almost went to school in boulder, colorado but i realized i would have to wear about 5 layers of clothing just to walk to class and i decided it just wasn't worth it. i am a texan, if i didn't break a sweat between classes i don't know what i would do with myself. i can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new college friends. i have been looking forward to that for a ",0

"to think about what life has become can be kind of scary. i wish i had a penny for every time i was about to mess up and i think i would be a very rich woman. if i only knew at 15 what i now know at almost 21, i could have saved myself alot of pain and confusion. then couldn't we all have? i get scared sometimes when i think about today, two weeks from now and even years from now. the future is a very scary thing especially when you don't know what it could bring. i wish i hadn't made some of the choices i've made but those are over and done with aren't they. the only thing i need to learn how to do now is to learn from my mistakes. i feel really bad sometimes because i try to force my ideas and ideologies on those younger than me but i feel older and wiser than my years. i feel alot older than 20 sometimes yet i think, """" hey i'm only 20, i have so much life to live"""" yet i'm scared to live that life. i wish i could just go with the flow instead of worry about every choice i make all the time. even when i go with the flow i don't know what i'm doing and then i worry about what could happen after the fact. another thing that really bothers me is the whole concept of love. what is it and how do i know if i've found it or not. when i was 15 i knew alot more about love than i do now. why do i ramble on so, it is the same dilemma and the same problems i face every single day. i really should just give up and go with the flow. not worry about things so much. life's too short to worry right,. all i'm doing is stressing myself out over nothing. stress is not something i should have in my life. my whole world is sheltered and taken care of and paid for. what do i really have to worry about. not that my dad doesn't have stipulations on what i do but it is all basically taken care of with no questions asked. life shouldn't be that easy right? maybe that's why i continue to torture myself with these unnecessary dilemmas. i'm one of those drama people to i need drama in my life, something always going on or i get bored. i need conflict but not too much because then i get way too stressed out. i just don't know what to do with daddy's little girl who seems really messed up in the head, there i go again creating drama, i'm not really messed up but sometimes i try to convince my self that i am to try to get counseling or something. i think it's a hidden freudian issue. i should have had counseling when i was a child but i never got it because i didn't really need it. maybe i was really traumatized as a child and now it's coming out subliminally. ok enough kelly, this is not like you. i really don't think all of this i just do sometimes. who knows i sure as hell don't. my dog is so cute now. too bad i don't live with him. i want to be taken care of pampered in a way, just plain babied. that's what should happen for women isn't it. no we should be strong and independent but i don't really feel that way. i would love to live a life similar to my mom's. she isn't as taken care of as i would like to be but my daddy does all right by her. who knows what life will bring maybe i will quit thinking about it. oh. the clock on my computer says i've been typing for twenty minutes. cool this is a really good stress reliever and i really felt like i was talking to someone. cya ",1
"its really hard to write what i am thinking about because when i am asked to do that, i think about what to write. i then go and think of other things that are on my mind and really don't need to be shared with the general public. what i am physically feeling right now is heat. our house is hot although we have the a'c running non stop. mentally, i am confused. the thoughts that go through my head at times make me think that i am crazy and that i should seek help. i am not the only one who thinks that but my family members and my friends also think that i should get some help. but truthfully, there is no help. who controls the mind? ones self controls the mind. all i really have to do is concentrate and i can control myself. powerful things can be accomplished with mind control. its odd how sometimes i know what people are going to ask me before they ask me. it happens allot. then people look at me in an akward form. i don't know how that happens. it just does. i can also go through the thought process of other people. sometimes, when my friends perform certain actions, i can think the exact same thing they were thinking at the time they were doing that. the only time this thought process causes a problem is when i am reading the news and read about acts of violence against children. its not that great when you can place yourself in the shoes of the aggressor when you really don't want to. its all invouluntary. this would be allot easier if i was writing in pencil. i think faster when i am writing things down. it helps me organize my thoughts. when i speak to people, i like to confuse them. sometimes i confuse them so much, they believe that a conclusion was reached at the end of our conversation but when they think about it, they find out that i only caused them to think of more questions. i don't know why i enjoy that. when we think, what do we think about the most? what is easier or what needs a solution. writing about what i think is hard. i am not sure if i think of too many things at once or just don't think at all. i do just stop thinking and drift off into my own world and just stay there, thoughtless? feelings: mixed feelings. not sure what to do with my life. would prefer not to be in college but know that sucess comes with knowledge. psychology has interested me since i was a child. i like knowing what people are thinking about. that is what i do; i observe. but observation comes with a price. since i play the role of observer, it is hard for me to actually detail what is going on in my day and not others. people think that i really don't want to talk much about myself (which is true to some extent). what really happens is that i don't know how to organize my daily activities to be shared with others. silence is my audience when i am by myself. but when i need to concentrate and do my homework, i need noise. i can not concentrate where it is quiet. the silence distracts me. when i read, i listen to music. when i do other homework that does not involve reading, i listen to music, talk to others, and also do the homework of another class at the same time. i need distractions to concentrate. another physical pain came to my mind. i have back pain. most times, i take pain killers to ease the pain. the pain killers i use arent that effective and they are stong pain killers. i take hydrocodone and naproxen 500 mg each. i sometimes take two naproxen and one hydrocodone or vice versa. that does very little to ease the pain. since they are so effective, i just don't take them and deal with the pain. thanks to my servere back pain, i am now not affected by other types of pain. i need a new body. i also have knee pains. i have joint pain. i am overweight. i need to do something with my life. something new. i would like to skydive. life is not worht living if you don't take risks. i ran out of things to write about. i lost my stream of consciousness. i need the weekend to be here so that i can catch up on my homework. i procrastinate too much. i have talked to a psychiatrist before. it really didnt help. nothing helps. once must deal with their problems themself and keep them to themself. contorl them with ones mind and keep them undercontrol.

"during the weekend, i love to go to mall. to buy something that makes me feels good. if i have a chance to go in the mall, first, i would like to eat something in the restaurant because i get starve. i love to eat chinese food. sometimes i choose sweet sour chicken and fried rice. that is my favorite food. if i have a second choice that it would be pepper steak and white rice. when i am full, i start thinking of what i need t shop around other place to buy what i need. at this time , i need to buy fall season cloths. all i have right now is one pair of jean and one sweater. that is not enough to wear for the rest of the season. all i need is one more extra sweater and another pair of jean. and then i would like to buy something to decorate my house. i would like to have of book holder because i have lots of books. whenever i see interesting things on tv i would like to go to the mall and buy it. in my kitchen, i saw a microwave is not working anymore. on tv the commercial shows they are having a big sale in jcpenney. it cost about only sixty dollars. i think that is a good deal to buy a microwave for sixty dollars. i try to get a new laptop. but my budget is not enough to buy another computer. they are a pretty good deal for a dell computer in a market place. the computer market is having a pretty good mark down of price now. but when i get everything together, it cost over one thousnad dollars i need to spend all of it. i think the computer is popular consumer in the market. but i make a mind that i don't want to spend not much money, because it is not worth it. spending is not the way to feel better. how are you going to control your mind is better way to concern it. we are so busy living in collage life. everyone needs a rest in the weekend. shopping in a mall is good subject of good things to relax your mind. control you're budget and thinking of controlling your mind is the best way to think.

"here i am sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts. i am thinking that i shouldn't worry about what to think. i am not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary, but then again i am no psychologist. whoa, change in thought. now i am thinking of england and of how i wish i could go there to see the sights and see a close friend who lives there. now i am sad because this reminds me of princess diana and of what a wonderful woman she was. i was truly saddened when i heard she died. she was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for a moment. she was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you. this sadness takes me to other places, i am now simultaneously thinking of a close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of aids. i am a christian and i have strong christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving a supposed loving god. sometimes i praise god for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why. i have always been a dreamer, setting my goals high, but sometimes i wonder if what i want to do with my life is right or if god wanted me to go off and become a minister. life is never simple but i just try to roll with the punches. a minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt. they try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out, but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much. at the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to a lesser degree of love then is possible. i want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly, but in reality i have been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again. whenever you go on a date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself. i think that is a huge crock of shit. i am a multi faceted person, i don't even know what being myself would be. is that the self that you express outwardly, where in my case i am jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very, very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring. sometimes i feel like i have all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give it to. i try not to dwell in these places for any significant amount of time. i think io like who i am, but its just that i really haven't figured that out completely yet. at first i didn't know what to write, but now i am glad we did this assignment. it is good to get your feelings out from inside when you don't want to tell anyone and you don't have a diary. bye-bye.

"i am doing this at the last minute and feel bad that i am but we do not have internet access at my house right now because our america online is on the fritz but i am very happy that i can do it at the library. now that i have been typing for three minutes i feel more relaxed and confident, i hope that this computer will submit this to you after i complete the assignment. i have a lot going on in my life at the moment, pledgeship is taking its toll in me and consuming a lot of my time and at least my business has slowed down at the moment. i have a little time to catch my breath. i am very pleases and excited with ut and look forward to getting back into my groove and having a set schedule. pledgeship is taking up a lot of time but it is only for 8 weeks and that is good i need a date for the party this friday night and am a little preoccupied with it. , there are a few girls that i have in mind and would like to take and of course i want to make a good impression at my first pledge party so i will look good to my fellow pledge brothers. my pager just went off which means that i have another job to go do and i will do it tomorrow i hope that i am doing the correct thing for your experiment i firmly believe that there can never be a random experiment because once a person knows they are being experimented on it can and will influence their outcome. this is what i told my statistics teacher when we were discussing random surveys. come on have you ever been in the mall and somebody asks you to do an experiment and you slightly alter your answers because either you were embarrassed or the like, sure we all have and that is why people are not truly random i believe that we all have logarithms that are inherent in our minds, kind of like blueprints or instincts that tell us to act of do certain things and with these being in our mind we can never truly be random. if broken down to the lowest level a pattern would form and from this pattern we would be able to predict responses and behavior thus disproving the theory of randomness my time is about up i hope that you have enjoyed listening to the voice in my head and i also hope that you will see things with a different perspective now. if you don't that's okay because not many people think that the random theory is true anyway. but i do.

"ok. i don't like to write, but i guess this isn't really writing. there is a hair stuck between the keys. ans i can't get it out. it is bothering me. why are my dogs barking? maybe my sister is home from school. i don't know what to write. my nose itches. i am hungary. i want to go to chilli's, but i don't kow if i can. i am so bad at typing. man, i wish that i had my computer. i can't beleive that no one was here when it came. i better get it by this weekend. ok, i guess my sister isn't here. then why were my dogs barking? when is she going to be home? she should be here by now? what time is it? ya, she should be here. josh's sister is home allready. is thst how you spell allready?, or do you spell it already with one l? ah, it hasn't even been 10 minutes left. i think that i burnt my tongue on that kolache. it wa sgood though. i want that other piece of it. i miss my little kids from la petite. i wander if i should get a job there on just fridays. but, i don't know if i will have time to work and get all of my studying done. probibly not, because i am already a little behind on my reading. i hate chemistry. i really dread going to that class. i don't understan it at all. it's like the profesor just skips over the basics. how am i suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school. i should have goe to that help session thing. well, it would have helped if i knew where it was. i wander what josh is doing. hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here. well, i know he isn't because he would have called me. did he take tish out to taylor with him? bla bla bla. where is kristen? i am getting worried, i should call mom. maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus. i hope she is ok. i need to call my mom. i really want shrimp pasta stuff. that would be really good. i need to read. i have so much reading to do for biology. i don't want to take amber to her school. what a pain in the but, i am never going to be able to finish reading tonight. i don't have time.

"however, after becoming sick i began to notice how much i was dependant on my mother to help me , and take me to the doctor and pick up any medicines i needed. now i have to do it all on my own. i had to wake up in the middle of the night and take myself to the hospital, i had to pick up my medicine, i was now the one who signed the form for my treatment to occur, not my mother. now it is all me, and in a way that kind of frightens me. i now have to wonder if i am doing things right, or if i am screwing things up. also, i keep thinking about going home this weekend for the first time, and i am not quite sure if i feel ready to see some of the people i graduated with. i am really excited about seeing my parents and friends, but i am really dreading going to my former high school's football game. then all of this brings up another thought into my mind. everyone so going to make comments on the fact that i still don't have a boyfriend, or that i am too picky when it comes to guys, and all of that other mess. all of this seems so superficial when i look at it, but this is the stuff that i have been thinking about. i have met several guys that i am really interested in, but it seems like there is always a problem. i always seem to be able to pick things out about guys and turn a perfectly good guy into a loser. i can pretend that i like a guy to suppress my feelings for wanting to be with somebody, but i can't last more than two weeks with that person. i can try and try to make things work out but i always seem to push guys away, which my other believes is her fault because of her and my father's divorce or something like that. i just seem to get scared when a guy gets to close to me. all through high school, all of my friends dated the same guy, and i was the one who had a different guy in every dance picture. i am unable to totally figure out what my problem is , but i am hoping now that i am in college i will """"find myself.

"right now i am not stressed and i feel very comfortable. however, i feel like i should be thinking of ways of obtaining a scholarship so i can help my parents out. i guess you can say that i feel kind of guilty. i mean putting two kids through college is no joke. i guess i have been pretty preoccupied with that during my entire stay at utaustin. overall i like the campus. most of the parties and events that i want to attend are off campus, but that does not keep me from having fun. the people are generally nice here. that was really unexpected, because most of the people at my high school usually considered themselves superior to the rest of the people. i wouldn't say that my high school years were the best because it was not. however i think that i could have made it better. however, now that i am in college, i feel that i can start my life all over again. all those mistakes that i made in high school are gone and i can try to learn from them. (such as waiting until the night before a major exam to study) i think that college will definitely teach me how to balance my time. i am glad that my parents decided not to let me work because i do not know how i could have adjusted. however i know that i will have to work at some time during the school year. hopefully i will be able to handle it. i am pretty much worried about my classes and what grades i will get in them. so far it has not been so bad. i know that the worst is yet to come. preparedness is not one of my stronger assets. i tend to be flustered and nervous most of the time. a young woman that i knew from high school told me that the important thing to do in college is not to stress. hopefully i will live up to that. i can't promise anything. i still feel upset that i did not get any type of scholarship. i felt that i worked hard, but then again there are a lot of intelligent young people on this campus and not all of them obtained scholarships. so in other words, i don't feel as bad as i used to.

"this seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. i wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if i should capitalize my letters. normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. i can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. then there's the side of me that is analytical, am i typing too much? why am i talking to myself? damn a minute is a long time? there are always questions. i've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. i believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). i have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. i got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. the breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. it is also amusing that i, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. my room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; i already sleep too much. you would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. i feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. what happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? i think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 20 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. it's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. that's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. there is alot of dissapointment in the senses. our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. i also wonder what this expiriment is for. what is it that you are trying to get out of me? my age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium? that's a funny thing to say. my mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing. is it ok if i pause a few times. it's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. i watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something i now can relate to. it's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). i only wish i never do that to anyone, for i know how it feels and it is from that that i do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 20 minutes or can you finish your sentence. i guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.

"it is now eleven o'clock and i'm getting hungry for lunch. i don't know why i'm hungry, i just ate a couple of hours ago. i really wish i didn't get hungry so often. sometimes i think i'm not really hungry, but i just like eating. i'm not overweight, but i really haven't felt good about my body for a couple of months now because i've been away and too busy to go to the gym as often as i used to. i'm worried that when i go back home to california in a couple of months for thanksgiving people are going to think i've gained weight. when i go back i want to look good, even better than when i left. i can't wait to go home, well actually, i can. i know when i get home i'm going to wish that i was still back here. my dorm room is already starting to feel like home to me. i was really upset that joe didn't call last night. it's been over two weeks since i talked to him last and he had promised to call the next day. i don't even have his phone number so there's no way i can reach him. i swear, that boy drives me mad! oh, well, i'm not going to think about him any more. i'm really glad to finally be doing this assignment. i've been meaning to but my computer isn't set up so it's been impossible to do. i am so frustrated with this whole ethernet thing. i've been to the store so many times and they never have the part i need. finally i thought about using the computer lab here in kinsolving. it's really nice as a matter of fact. it feels good to be on a computer again. i miss mine from home even though i wasn't on it very much. i wonder if anyone will ever really read this paper. i think i would laugh at half the stuff i've written. i don't know why i'm telling you these things, you don't even know, or care, who joe is or that i have a computer. this place just got really full, it's weird how people seem to come in clumps. have you ever noticed that at places there will be no line and then all the sudden there's a huge long line? that's weird, i think. i miss my dog. he died this summer while i was away in germany. i just wish i'd given him more attention when i was home. i knew he would die some day, but i just never thought it would be so soon. i miss the meyers. that's the family i was with in germany. they were so nice to me, i felt like part of the family. not many people get to do all the cool stuff i've been blessed enough to experience. i love to travel, but it's always so nice to be home. i was never bored this summer. that's a first for me. i'm almost always bored. i didn't get any letters today. that's the first time i haven't gotten any since i've been here. it kind of sucks. sorry for swearing, i don't usually swear. i still have ten minuets to write. i'm running out of things to say. you must be so bored by now. someone is playing music in the lobby. it's really annoying me. i can't wait to go to sleep tonight. why am i always so tired. i don't even care if i go out anymore. i'm so jealous of my roommate. she is always doing cool stuff with her sorority and i haven't done much yet. she's really cute. i love her curly hair. we tried to make mine curly but it was more of a wave. it looked good, but i didn't know what other people would think about it. i just realized people could e-mail me down here that's good because people have been bugging me for my address. i can't wait until my computer is running. i'm so excited for the football game on saturday, i just hope it's not too hot. i hope we beat ucla because a lot of my friends are going there and i know that they'll think of me when they see ut and i want them to be jealous that the longhorns won. that's bad that i want them to be jealous. it's not really what i want, i just want them to think of me. it would be really neat if i could get on tv then they could see me here and know that i'm okay and having fun. i really am having fun, but it sounds so fake when i tell people that, like i'm just pretending or something. ljliujiojkl ",0
"i don't know what to write about really and i have a bunch of other things on my mind. i haven't eaten breakfast yet and i'm pretty hungry, but i fear that if i don't do this now i might never get around to doing it. the assignment doesn't seem to be that difficult, but sometimes i have trouble thinking of things to say. i'm not going to my calculus study session because i think it will mainly be review of what i have already learned in high school. my roommates friend henry just called and somewhat interrupted my thoughts. i don't think my roommate likes henry very much but i don't know that for sure. he always calls when my roommate isn't here which to me is a signal that they're not really in sync. when i feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we're in sync with each other. i think that the more time you spend with a person the more you become somehow linked to that person. i've been waiting to read a book for some time now and my friend just finished and gave it to me. i think everyone should read ain't nobody's business if you do: the absurdity of consensual crimes in our free country by peter mcwilliams. not only is it a very controversial book, but it is also humorous and very informative and educational. peter mcwilliams has aids, cancer, and was using marijuana for medicinal purposes under california state law, but was arrested and thrown in jail. i agree with mcwilliams 100% about consensual crime being ridiculous and i think it's wrong that he's in jail now. i got fined $15 recently for parking in lot a67 next to jester. the parking and traffic administration expects me to park on the other side of red river, or better yet i35. i think this is stupid and am very upset with this, i plan on writing a letter of complaint to david kapalko. my parents finally came to their senses and bought me a computer for school. that is one of the main reasons i am able to do this assignment now. i didn't feel comfortable writing these kind of personal thoughts in a computer lab full of other people. my parents got a good computer for a low price and now i can work from my dorm room, so i think everyone is satisfied. i just wonder if having a computer will be another hindrance to meeting new people especially girls. not that there aren't plenty of girls that use computers, but i don't really get out enough as it is. i know it's up to me to make the effort but i almost feel trapped in a situation where i don't meet enough girls or hang around them enough.

"i guess i'm just supposed to write what i'm thinking right now. i love listening to music. i guess it releases some kind of hormone or something that can just totally change my mood. if i'm sad about something, which would most likely have to do with my boyfriend or my parents, i can listen to a song and it will totally relax me and make me feel so much better. it should a kind of therapy i think that they have already made that up musical therapy. one of my friends from high school that is going to university of north texas is majoring in that i think. i really miss michael. he's my best friend and my boyfriend all in one. i can't wait to talk to him today i've already done all of my homework for today and i don't have any more classes today. mondays, wednesdays, and fridays are my hard days. i had a rhetoric class that i was taking but i'm not anymore because the professor gave a really sour first impression she didn't seem happy at all to be teaching. i think that that's sad when someone doesn't like their job. i want to be happy when i'm older i want to be a child psychiatrist. but as of right now, the psych department isn't accepting any more psych majors so i'm going to have to wait on that one. i want to continue to medical school, but i don't know where i want to apply for that. i have a couple of years to think about it though more than a couple. oh my favorite song is on one of those songs that you just want to turn up really loud. okay i have ten more minutes. okay, my shoes are too small! have you ever had a pair of tennis shoes that are too small? it really is painful i hope my feet aren't still growing because they are already a size 8 and a half and a 9 would make me look like i have clown feet. if you have size 9 feet i'm sure you don't look like you have clown feet so don't take it the wrong way. i'm just talking about me. i hate the people who walk around college like they are cooler than everyone else you know they probably thought that they were so cool in high school. maybe the star quarterback or the head cheerleader. but who even cares about that stuff now. not me! but that's okay. i took an ap psych course last year in high school and i loved it. it's what got me interested in psychology in the first place. i was going to be a photojournalist. but after taking the psych class i decided that i really enjoyed that a lot more than photography. photography is great as a hobby though, but not to make a living. i also was watching a show on tlc on a family vacation to canada (dad's idea) and it was an er show and i really thought that was interesting. i can be easily inspired. okay my time is up.

"ow. i just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. i bump intot stuff a lot. i think that it's because i don't pay much attention or maybe because i'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about the wall in front of me. i ramble a lot too and i don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. i've told the people at the management place and i don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and i'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if i don't like having the lights on? what if i'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way i can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing i'm not like that. i don't type as well as i wish i did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. i forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, i hope it's not overdue. i already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when i told him i scratched the car? it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when i messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and i don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if i ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when i know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because i have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. i don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and i don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. i like sharing my opinion. i even like it when people get mad or offended. i don't know why, i just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. i can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid i thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what i think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that i think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but i would never tell her that, and i certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. i think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because i only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if i can't talk to you i don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, i'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be evil, god forbid. god forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. i hate stupid people. i'm sorry, i'm a mean person. i don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. i hate when people ask me how i like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, i hate asking people stuff like that so i don't and i expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that i hate that. they don't know me there's no way they could know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. i am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. i wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do i mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. i don't think i have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then i feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. i think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up ",1
"alright, this is going to be pretty random, so whomever may be reading this should be pretty amused. hmmm. . i had my audition for the """"madrigal dinner"""" tonight. i think it went pretty well. i sang a song that i wrote. he seemed pretty impressed. i find out monday morning if i made it or not. i think until then i am going to have a nervous tick thing happening. i broke up with my boyfriend this weekend. he is really stupid, """"dumber than a box of hair"""" as i like to say. that sounds pretty mean, but he really is. he isn't going anywhere. he is a 5th year high school student. if you carry on a conversation with him that involves a word with more than 5 letters, he is lost. unless it is about auto mechanics. then he will talk your ear off. or if it is about drugs, he can talk 499000 miles an hour on that subject. we were just too different. i'm not into drugs and stuff and i am 17 and already in college. he is a pot head (along with other things) and he's 19 and still in high school. he is going nowhere. he wrote me a really shitty letter today. it made me feel like crap. it was along the lines of """"i am nothing. you are too good for me. i should have known that the second i got something good i would lose it. """" how am i supposed to respond to somthing like that????? my friends said it was his feeble attempt to win me back. a very feeble attempt. i am not conned into taking someone back because they make me feel guilty for ruining their life. i feel really bad though, because his parents absolutely adored me. i was everything they wanted him to be. i am fairly intelligent, christian, drug-free, etc. i feel kinda like i let them down. but i wasn't getting to him. i couldn't change him. it's not my fault right?? what could i do? i can lead him to the right path, but i can't force him to change. i showed him what christianity did for my life, did in my life, what influence god had over me. but he was so stuck on his paegan ways. he told me he was going to quit drugs for me, but he never did. i can't be with someone for the sole reason of trying to change them. i don't know. i miss my ex-boyfriend. not the same guy. a different one. we went out for 3 years, then he slept with my best friend. on that ridiculously long survey that we had to do for this class, that """"worst depression"""" stuff was caused by him. 3 years!!! and then he just threw it all away. gosh, i miss him terribly. sometimes i still cry at night thinking about him. i have yet to find a love so strong like i had with him. have you ever felt that? that feeling like you know, i don't know exactly what you know. you just know something. that feeling deep inside. that feeling noone else can give you. i had that with him. we were even engaged. engaged!! he made me feel like i was something worth having. well, until he screwed my ex best friend. stupid whore! i'm not bitter. hehehe, anyway. i don't know. sometimes he is all i can think of. i'll catch myself comparing other guys to him. every other guy i have dated has been compared to him. should i put a name to """"him""""? his name is j. j. anyway, i always have this emptiness inside me. i didn't feel empty with him. it was like he made me complete. and when he left, he took a big part with him. i know that sounds trite, but i can't think of any other way to describe it. just pure emptiness. i got so depressed after the """"incident"""" that i didn't have the will to do anything. nothing. i just laid there in bed. i would be in a trance through school just to come home and lay there. didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, didn't sleep. i never slept, but i was never awake either. it was like i was one of those vegetable people who was purely living because of the machines they are hooked up to. there was this invisible machine keeping me alive, and that was it. i was just existing. that's the word i was looking for. existing. nothing more, nothing less. i tried to make it less. have the scars to prove it. nothing i'm proud of. i had just reached the lowest i have ever felt. i'm sure it will happen again. i'm only 17. i'm sure i will find another guy that will fill the void jj left, but then he will leave me too. so what's the use anyway? dating is just a vicious circle. someone is bound to get hurt. if not you, then the other person. unless of course you find that one person that doesn't have the urge to bang one of your friends. but shit, that even happens in marriages. you think you found that one person that won't screw you over, and what happens? they screw some younger, prettier girl. gosh, i'm really bitter. when did i get this bitter?? is it bitterness or cynicism? i can never tell the difference. maybe i'm a little (or a lot) of both. <deep sigh> one minute left. okay, now i'm depressed. i was in a good mood after my audition. then i get to thinking. damn thinking. it never does me any good. i always seem to think about things that depress me. i think it is because all of my good memories are linked to painful ones. so i try to think of good ones, but it just takes a turn for the worse. adios!

"i'm thinking i don't know what i'm thinking. its like my mind is still working although i don't know what to write. i wonder how the keyboard came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are. my history class will be more difficult than i anticipated, my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about. i wonder if he's married, i think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife. i knew a guy at my high school like that, he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him, i never understood it. he was friends with the craziest people. terrill had a death wish. he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge. i wonder why the timer isn't working. i thought a timer was counting down when pennebaker did this site as an example in class. i'll just stop the timer when 20 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working. i hate computers. i hate computing. computing is going to be a bad class that i am not looking forward too. ut is a beautiful campus. i like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking. i want to get a bike so i can ride to psychology quickly on mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after. i'm worried about kaitlin. i think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but i think war might change her in some way. she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers. i hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going. iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things i've ever seen in my life. if a sandspider attacked me i would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life. rishi is making a weird ass noise. like breathing when you are lifting weights or something. brian is my best friend and he almost died. it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die. i am 18 and invincible or so i thought. this must change the entire way he views life. don't treat it as something to take for granted. it is definitely a gift and some people just don't understand that. they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse. i need to get a rug our room is dirty. i'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long. i like the way the window faces north. i can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning. i want to buy a hang glider really really bad. what is my fascination with flight, it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot i don't know. i hope i didn't choose the wrong career path with the one i have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless i become moderately rich. i hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel, even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever. i wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport. that might be a fun job. maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. austin is a cool city. i think if my job permits me, i would like to stay here for a good portion of my life. i also want to live outside the us for a while. in a country that has ancient cultural significance. maybe greece or france or italy. that would be the shit. i feel like stretching. my back always needs to be stretched after i wake up. i wonder why that is. ok so the timer should have reached 20 minutes by now so i will hit submit.

" well, i am sitting here fighting with myself about whether or not i should go out tongight. it looks like i will probably give in and go to the ka house. i don't think i should because i have a lot of work to do. i am excited to go and see my grandmother tomorrow. i miss my friends a lot especially justin. i am wondering why i haven't been able to get a hold of him. so i don't have a lot on my mind, but this is fun because i get to listen to all of the music i just downloaded. our tv in the living room is super loud! i can hear it over my music and through a closed door. things with bryan seem to be going well, but i definitely don't see things progressing too much further. i am really tired today. i should be sleeping a lot more than i have been. oh well. i need to do my devotional before i go anywhere tonight because i will feel really bad if i forget. i am very concerned about justin. i cannot stop thinking about what our issues are or aren't. i wonder what my parents are doing tonight. i miss seeing them every day, but at least i talk to them a lot. it feels super weird to be away and completely on my own, but i think i will surprise myself at how well i will do. that pizza that i ate earlier was not good. i guess it doesn't settle well because i don't eat it very often. i am so excited about my kin class. it is so awesome, and i love that the professors are married and christians. that's so great. paige is really cool, too, and i am very glad that she is in that class with me. i hope we end up hanging out a lot this year. i was so worried about meeting people who loved god, and it's been really reassuring so far. the tri-delts are perfect girls for me. they're so good, and they have 3 bible studies! yea! elton john is really talented. it cracks me up that i've gotten so into this computer business. it's really fun, though. i got my first email today. who better from but sebastian? he's awesome, but it sucks that he lives in chile. okay, i am having a lull. i really feel very exhausted, but of course i will go out as soon as i finish this assignment. it is so stupid how vain i have gotten since i have been here, but i am sure that that will go away after a little time. i am so nervous about taking my first tests. i love all of my classes, but i wonder about how prepared i am from high school, and how well my study habits will allow me to do. this assignment is really very cool. i thought it would take forever, but the time is flying. so i am very cold right now; surprise, surprise. i think of my girls from kerrville every time that i begin a sentence with so. i definitely should not do that very much. my mother would not be proud of me. unchained melody must be one of the most romantic songs ever recorded. it makes me miss justin. i suppose i will try to call him again right now.

"i am so excited about being down at ut but now i realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at ut. i have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. luckily, i have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. this week is the only week that i am going to go out every night but i have just had so much fun. there is a guy that i met when i came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. i am looking forward to seeing him again. i absolutely love the classes that i am taking right now. it is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. the material has been interesting and i can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. i am having some roommate problems right now, though. one of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. i need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe i will take her to lunch this weekend. saturday at the game i get to sit in a box and i am so excited. the last game was fun but it was at night and i was burning up so i can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. thankfully i will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. i really like the guy i am going with. not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. he is a gentleman and really looks out for me. last night i met this really cute guy and he kissed me but i found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to tcu- what a jerk! i am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. i thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. you really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. i am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. i really do miss my mom and my house. the food at hardin house is so gross and i hate to eat it. i know that i am going to gain the freshman fifteen. this year is my sisters debutante season and when i go home i am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that i ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. but i have been working out everyday and trying to watch what i eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and i always end up grabbing a handful. but, life is short. right now i am going to finish this writing and then i am going to study some spanish and try to start reading psychology. i am really mad that i am going to miss the first exam but thankfully i will be able to make it up. i am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. i almost wish i was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when i give it up. i have enjoyed everything that i have gotten to do and see since i have been miss teen of america and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. i would like to run for president of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. i would love to be president of pi phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. i haven't gotten involved in anything at ut yet and i am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. my neck hurts today and i think it is from carrying my backpack all around. i had to take a bunch of my books back to the co-op the other day so i got to lug the around. not fun! ut is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. my sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to tcu, but i love it at ut. i just really feel at home in austin and i enjoy the diversity of all the people. it really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. coming from midland, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. i guess i will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading.

"today has been an interesting day. i woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt i was in a bad mood. then i went into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and i thought i would read the morning paper the austin american statesman to keep up the what is going on in the death of diana, princess of whales. since i am starting out in my major right now, which is journalism, i find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the forefront of all media coverage in every medium. it seems strange that i am 29 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. it is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. i am actually studying public relations, but i have to study journalism as the foundation for my study. i guess i chose pr because my dad is the public information officer for the portland fire bureau. he has worked there for over 25 years and i used to accompany him to work on some occasions when i was a kid. i think i liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. i liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. also, i loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer. oops!! i just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. it was my husband's professor that is the chair on his dissertation. her name is nina and i always joke with thomas that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. i don't really believe it, but i like to tease him. i know thomas will be very faithful to me. that is one of the things i love most about him. anyway. getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that i read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of diana, princess of whales. i think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that i didn't even know about before. i don't worship princess di, but i feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. the articles revealed how much she is the people's princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. i think to myself, wow! what kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. she did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and aids victims. she was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. in some ways, i see her doing a christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. i believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and'or fame which demands mass attention and respect. i love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. i am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. i am feeling very sad once again. why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. i wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. i believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. i am thankful for people such as princess diana and for the example she has been to so many. that brings me to another reoccurring thought. is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. i believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. god wants us to recognize that he is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to him for guidance and help in this life. so getting back to my earlier point, taking princess diana as an example. some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of princess diana this whole week in the media. well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't do anything like make new laws or something important like that. my goodness!!! that just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. that is unfair. i think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. i know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so me-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. my wish is that people will carry on princess di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. we could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another. well, this has definitely succeeded the 20 minute allotment. i thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. it has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. we need more heroes like diana. she is an example to us all. it is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. i pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death.

"well, hello mr. paper. i am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. where should i start. """"start"""", isn't that a funny word. about as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. well, this might be pretty long because i type pretty fast. my eyes are so tired. sometimes i think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that i need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. sometimes when i take deep breathes it hurts. """"why?"""" you ask. well it is a long story. it doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( i won't get into it). so, i am a college student now. what does that exactly mean? i think it means i can finally be myself. i don't have to worry about what my parents will think. there is only one restriction still holding my true self down. my girlfriend that i still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. she lives all the way over in galveston, and i can't stand the way things are. i say that i am in love with her, but is that true when i am so happy to be away from her? anyways, i say """"restriction"""" because that is what she is right now. i literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything i do. so i guess in a way i didn't get away from my parents. she took their place. so, i figure that as long as she is in galveston, and completely attached to me, i have to have my fun here and then lie to her. i know it sounds bad, but if i were to tell her what i actually do here, i would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. ok, i am sick of talking about this. the women at this university are the most amazing i have ever seen. and i guess that is why i am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. i have never seen so many good looking women. i feel like i am in a candy store. and it helps that i am a good looking guy, because i get their attention. that sounds conceited, but i am an honest man. i know that some women are attracted to me, and i am attracted to many women. also, i am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. i just tell here all the girls are ugly. i brought a camera to school. i have some incriminating photos on that thing. i need to get those developed and locked away. nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. you see, why does everything come back to her. i hate it. i don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! but what do i do? i respect and love her too much to hurt her. so, i spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. yet another thing i should be having to do. i just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and not worry about a relationship. seriously, i have to get off this. let's change the subject. i want to talk about cheese. cheese is really weird. it comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. i know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. and then where do the holes come from? are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? swiss is my favorite. american is horrible. it just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. cheddar is enjoyable. there are no other cheeses as far as i am concerned. they go great on hamburgers. with lettuce and mayo and ketchup, i can have myself a meal. well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so i will end it here. it was wonderful to type on this lovely screen!

"i am wondering why i decided to wear this shirt today. no i'm not. i kow why i did. i wanted to look nice. gosh! why do people keep sending me messages? i put my away message on. wow, i can type pretty fast, but i'm getting distracted because i'm wiggling in the chair and my ponytail is tickling the back of my neck. i hear voices outside - what are the girls in my dorm doing? the door just slammed, so i guess they just got home from class. hope they're not doing anything fun without me. ouch, my stomach kind of hurts. i guess i'm not under that much stress because (darn, i always mess up because"""" when i type!) i think i might be getting sick. i really liked that lecture. i learned so much! my neck is kind of tense now, and i hate typing for too long. i type much too fast, or rather i think much too quickly. it's only been 3 minutes. this writing assignment will be a long one, i'm sure. i'm kind of worried about running for rhc vice president. i hate elections, i hate campaigning. everytime i run for an election, someone always tries to do something really underhanded, like spread rumors or tear down posters or just do something really mean. gosh, this folder on my desk is really in the way and i think the fan in this room is much too loud. i wish my roommate was her - i'm kind of lonely. i would like to go to dinner, but i think i'll wait until she gets home. but if she is not back soon, i'm going to eat a cookie from the pantry to tide me over. speaking of tide, laundry accumulates much too quickly in college. i've had to wash a ton of clothes since i've gotten here, and it's way too expensive. pkus, our washers and dryers don't work right, so i don't think that they're ever really clean. gosh, i worry too much about my punctuation and grammar. i really doubt whether i sound intelligent in these essays - the structure is not right, the grammar most likely isn't, and the spelling is constantly corrected. there's a blinking light telling me that i have an i'm, but i don't want to answer it. i'm trying to type! go away! gosh, there's another message. leave me alone. nooooo!my neck still hurts too. i could really go for a massage. i keep thinking about today's lecture. it really made me feel so much better. i'm so glad dr. pennebaker told us that everyone feels kind of stupid and lonely when they first get to college. i know i do. now the phone's ringing. grrrr. i guess i'm not that lonely after all. i really like the new people that i have met in college and i think that the classes are really interesting, but everyone in my fig seems to absorb info much faster than i do. i mean, i'm a smart girl, but i have to read and read to understand information. my parents are like that too. they don't understand what they read right off the bat. they have to read it two or three times ot really understand it. i really like having examples or analogies for the stuff i read. it helps to illustrate the point. i don't understand. grrr, the fan is still too loud. just plain definitions. i need more than that. the sun is really bright. i wish my desk didn't face the window. i really wish that we had a better view from the window. all i see when i look outside is a brick wall. c'mon, a brick wall? that's hardly a view. and the girl next door just left to go to the gym or something. she always wears a ton of keys on a lanyard around her neck, so she jingles wherever she goes. darn! i don't remember the names of the boys i just met outside. they were really nice when my friend introduced me, but they were from nigeria and had really foreign names. one was like something with an f, i think. and the other. who knows? yay! my birthday is on friday. i can't wait to see what surprises are in store for me. i want to go out and have tons of fun with all my new friends, and then i want to go home and see my family. i really miss them. my mom sends me a card like everyday. i can't believe i left my keys in san antonio the last time i went home. my mom finally sent them to me today in a card, which was a relief. haha, i sighed just now, which i guess truly illustrates how relieved i was. i really want to get more mail. college students should set up some sort of program, like a buddy thing, where they could get more mail. the mailbox hardly ever has anything in it, but today i got a magazine. cool. and someone just sent me an i'm, but i don't know who it was. i'm almost done. i can answer them! i think i'll do that right now, and answer the other ims too. haha i guess people do love me! :) yay!

"my first week at ut has been okay despite the humid weather, long walks to class, and lack of sleep. already i am behind on most of my reading assignments. my math homework which is due sunday is incredibly hard. other than that, i have met new people and taken part in new experiences. for example i have never shared any of my stuff with anyone. but when i came to ut, i must share everything, including a dorm room, ethernet cable, printer, etc. with my friends, roommate, strangers, etc. life here is so different. there are so many types of people and the population of economics and psychology are overwhelming to me. the size of those classes is just a little smaller than my graduating class in high school. another problem is that i must force myself to wake up in the mornings and walk to class. right now my roommate is asleep which i am busily doing my homework and yet i am still behind. i can even hear her snore. sometimes this is very distracting to me; however, you must learn to cope with these dilemmas. i have never understood why i chose to come ut. i have realized that getting into the business program is not that important because i am not the only one that got in. i guess i came here because my friends did. they influenced me that going to ut was cheaper than if i went out of state to uc davis. i took their advice, although sometimes i wonder if i made the right decision. last night, some of my friends tried to convince me to attend a frat party. i knew she was never like this in arlington. i knew she was curious about what it was like, but everyone should know what to expect at one of these parties. i am glad i didn't go. i am feeling overwhelmed, scattered, and tired right now. i hear noises of people doing laundry, the air conditioner, the stupid building fans that are spinning below my dorm, etc. the lighting in here is horrible because i don't want to turn on the light in case it would wake up my roommate. although i am somewhat considerate of others like my roommate, are they considerate of me? i always clean up my messes, but she hardly ever does. for example if my hair is left in the bathtub, i always wash them down the drain and when water splashes out from the sink i clean it up, but will she do the same for me. i guess not since her hair is always laying around in the sink and her items take up most of the tub and sink area. well, i guess this is what it is like living with another person. i tend to complain a lot about things. maybe i do this because i am stressed out or really mad at something. sometimes on these assignments it is really hard to describe what you are feeling. when i was given this assignment in high school psychology, we had a certain word amount that had to be obtained. so i used ands and ums as additional words. twenty minutes is actually a long time to write such an assignment. i am still thinking about what to write. there are so many things i need to finish. one for example is my calculus homework. so as my twenty minutes is about to end, i hope ut will bring me many great memories.

"okay i'm writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and i hope my typing isn't keeping her up god i wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs i wonder if my computer was a bad idea when i decided to place it right by the window oh god i think i am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again i wonder if i'll get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through i feel a little drainage in my throat i hope i'm not catching my roommates cold oh god i hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 12:00 i never realized how hard it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me i want to move it but i don't want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh i can't stop writing because if i did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school i'm looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm i was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one i was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god i can't wait to use the sorority koozie i got on bid day for some reason i don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that i'm in a sorority, not that i'm not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my t-shirt i mean i'm no longer lindsey (blank) but i am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so i'd rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 12:07 boy i've never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self i wonder if i'll be able to swing this college life i mean i want to do well so well so i can prove it to my mom that i can do it yet i want to party a lot i know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because i still haven't attached the back part to my computer chair b'c this task requires me to use some tool that i don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers i put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am i proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but i really have no reason to go to bed b'c i have no classes before 12 and i'm not a morning person and i already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and i don't want to be too tired to party because i've risen before 10:00 am. so i have many incentives to not go to bed and i feel like shit if i get more than 8 hours of sleep i'm one of those always got to be busy people so i can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet i feel like a slug if i sleep to late actually i feel guilty as if i'm wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, i'm so proud of myself that i am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that i'm off to a good start see i just can't fathom how some girls i know are already missing class, i mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but i shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because i never know how long i will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and i'm signing off!

"this blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. i wonder why i put 3 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-i probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. i wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, i'm going to scoot up. i can't believe its sat at 700 pm and i'm writing this. i'm such a nerd. actually i'm not. ,. i'm cool--but that's all relative i guess. i'm really into drinking my coffee and i'm staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and i really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it? jewel is playing in the background volume 5 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. i can totally relate. i wonder if scott is thinking about me right now--i hope he's not the t. a for this class. this is so incredibly weird. i think i like him but i'm not sure. he reminds me of scott wolf and i can't stand him is that a bad sign? i like richard's accent too. wow english accents are really cute. like in london. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like gavin rossdale but he was speaking italian so i doubt it was him. i wonder how liz is doing? and michelle? why isn't ken calling me? i hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. kind of like max. i wonder how he's doing i wonder about his dumb model sister in paris. whatever. i love jewel. i want to play piano right now even though i haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 7 :20 already and this is pretty fun. i should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks i'm a rambling idiot? i have an ache in my heart about the council. i wonder why my name isn't on the list? i swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. they are so retarded. maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think i'm full of crap and making it up. but i really think that way. maybe it's cause i was listening to jewel at the time,. i wonder when my roommates are getting home they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 700am this morning for crew tryouts. ok, i probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. i have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. i wonder if st4eve will get back to me on being the coxin. i have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did i staple scott's number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me? he writes like such a guy. my walls are so bare. and the st4reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. i wish i could write songs like jewel. i want to play the guitar well too. i miss my dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and i wonder why i returned that dress. this screen is so confusing i lose my place my toe hurts and i feel full. my wrap was gross though. i can't believe they didn't take my cds--they're so retarded. my tailbone hurts and i hope i'm not sore tomorrow steve was a bit extreme. i keep hitting the wrong keys i really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but i know i need to do my homework. i hate calculus homework. i'm dreading it. i wonder why i'm so down and pessimistic today? i'm usually not. oh--gosh, i've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. i wonder if i typed more than other people did and i wonder if a ta. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it? weird. maybe i should play my guitar.

"i am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to mtv channel. it's playing justin timberlake song. i just got back from my biochemistry i class and the professor in that class seems very boring. i noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because i feel like i missed a lot of what he said while i was taking notes. i can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time. i feel i'm more of a single tasked person. besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and i can hear it's boiling right now and i think i need to check on it before the water boils over. i'll be back. well, i'm back. this week will be a tiring week for me since i have so much to catch up with anthropology reading. i pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means i have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks. my other teachers are okay and i seem to absorb a lot in their lectures. i don't think i can work out much this week and i maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday. plans for weekends are unsure since i haven't made any. hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to. i had already met some people in my dorm, but i haven't really met people in my classes. i also met the people from longhorn pre-pharmacy association. man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and i don't think i can usher again in the football for the longhorn pre-pharmacy since i haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago. i hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible. it's unexpected that somehow right now i feel more energetic than when i was about an hour ago when i was in biochemistry class. maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that i ate about 3 hours ago now is starting kick in. something about the song in mtv just made me looked at the screen. it's r. kelly in a japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because i am from an asian culture. in america, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often. as i'm watching a fighting scene in that r. kelly mtv, i think america has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art. instead, we have other things. i don't feel like listing them right now. it's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows america is diverse and multi culture. speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture. i have a lot to read on the forest people, who are people have very different culture from western and eastern culture. the book is ",1
"i'm really not sure what to write because i just am not feeling anything right mow but i am feeling good because i am listening to good music and that is something that will always make me feel good and i don't know why but even if i am really down music picks up and makes me feel better and i especially like to go to see live shows that is just about the only thing i really love to go out and do usually i would rather just sit at home and watch tv or listen to music. i am also feeling hungry and my roommate is making some vegetarian chili which kind of scares me because i am not really into vegetarian meals but hey i might as well eat it if he is going to make it. i am also wondering how long i have been writing because it seems like a long time but i think it has only been like ten minutes or so and i am running out of things to say. i guess could talk about this girl i am seeing. she is really cool but i don't really think i want to get involved with her in the way she wants to get involved with me, but i guess i should go out on another date before i come to that conclusion. that has been something that has been bothering me because she apparently likes me a lot, but i just don't think i like her in that way that she likes me and guess that now i am out on my own this is the first real problem i have had was dating and to tell you the truth it scares the hell out of me because when it comes to sex you never know what kind of diseases a girl might have and that scares me a lot.

"i'm still trying to figure out why i always procrastinate. i think i like to work under pressure, i have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. i wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. i hope the second because i have never been one to study, and i would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? i thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, i can already tell i'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, i already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life i want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. i'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. i'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. i read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was satan or the grim reaper or something like that. i think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. i hope bush wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, i am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. i just believe bush will do a lot better job than kerry, and the whole vietnam thing i just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while i don't know everything about it, i was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people i heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. i just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. i wish i could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. i wish i could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but i don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but i don't really know what happened there, i guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. i realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because i am thinking about how long it is, or i'm not doing an activity i find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun, i'm surprised i woke up for it. i missed class the other day when i slept through it and it was at 12. that's just strange, getting up at the 8 one, but oversleeping the 12. i wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor i met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which i would agree with although i haven't experienced life after school, but i think it will be hell.

" well, i think that i need to practice working on my team games more. my teammates and i have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. zendt usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, travis makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and i try to scout or tech myself. their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. in a one-on-one game, i only have to be concerned with what i am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. i have decided to dub the name of our team team suck , because we are that terrible. oh well, i can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day. amazingly enough, i don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment i'm doing right now so that i can go ahead and have it out of the way. hopefully, i won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. and even if i do, i will just do as much as i can on sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. it's not that i don't have a work ethic, it's just that i prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which i will be doing all the time while i am here at ut. they are only going to be around for a few days, and then i may not see them again until the next break. i wonder when it will start getting cold around here, i brought my jacket, but i shouldn't need it until october or so i believe. my bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, i should probably do something about that. it's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if i can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before i do. pretty sick, i know, but i did it when i first got here and i'll be damned if i get to do it every time. i should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. i wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. a couple of times i've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. one time i actually stepped on one before i knew what it was in the dark. that was quite nasty. there zendt goes, iming me while i'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if i spelled non-sequitious correctly. if i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or ta or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. i don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. i bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should i care if i have a few typos. i could pretend i'm a foreigner from germany or some crap, even if it did matter. except now i've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. must think of something else to type about. . . . . . um, i think i'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. that charcoal i've been using is a damn mess. i hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner. i wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. i am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. i wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . now ",0
"this is the second paper i have written like this because somehow the other one disappeared right when i was trying to push the finish button. it seems like my life is always going the wrong way or i have bad luck such as this for most of the time. i did just get through working out with my tae-bo tape. after completing that i always feel 100% better about myself and problems. i guess you could say that is how i deal with all of my stress,even though my life is not all that bad. whenever someone thinks their life is terrible i always think about those children that you see on television that are starving or sick. i don't know why but i whenever i see a homeless person on the street i immediately feel sorry for them but then i start to think about why they don't have a job or are not in a shelter. my mind goes back and fourth like that a lot. austin has a lot of homeless and i am so not used to that atmosphere, that is partly why i don't like living here. and because my boyfriend wants me to come back closer to where he lives which is dallas, where i live as well. i chose austin and ut because a lot of people told me that i should not go here, including my boyfriend. that just made me want to come even more though, dispite the fact that i could tell at orientation that i was not going to like it. my boyfriend is very important to me though because i have dated him for 4 years and we have a really special relationship. i can tell just by looking at him exactly what he is thinking about. i have never really had that with anyone before and he always tells me that he loves me. i find this kind of annoying because in my family i don't think that my mom or dad have ever told me those three words. my grandmother has but i used to just say it not even thinking about what it really meant. i guess that is why whenever he tells me that repeatably it starts to get on my nerves. hopefully i don't have love issues or something of that nature because don't get me wrong i truly know that my parents love me but they just never told me. i have had a good life so i really don't need to complain about small things. i am in a very difficult spot in my life, college is a lot harder than most people say. i mean i expected the classes to be difficult and challenging but not the living on your own part. i was always so ready to get away from my house and away from the town that i lived in. now i am not so sure about this because i don't really like austin. i believe that i would have been better at a smaller school but i never really thought about those issues when i was selecting a college. i was too busy talking to or seeing my boyfriend or worrying about stupid high school bull that goes on everyday. i should have not cared where my best friend went to school, even though she was supposed to come here with me and then suddenly changed her mind without telling me. i am not resentful or anything but i feel that it is partly her fault, no it's not it is all my fault. i am the one who chose my future and now i want to change those plans. i guess i should be greatful that my roommate is not some freak with earrings and tattoos all over her body. i always think that things can always get worse and if you're lucky they sometimes get better. at least i did not get stuck in the same room as my suite mates because they are kind of snobbish. for instance, if i see them outside of our dorm then i have to say hi and if i don't they pretend they don't know me. i don't understand why people are like that but who am i to make a judgement, for all i know they are really sincere and nice people. i talk about people way too much but if you do it for so long it just comes natural and you can't stop. my room is actually really comfortable right now, usually it is either way hot or real cold.

"i'm thinking this is a different assignment and that it is going to be hard to just let thoughts come in naturally, since i am used to having a specific reason for writing. i always shake my leg. yes, i do it all the time, like it is a nervous reaction. i think i am tense to often, always worrying about what i need to be doing or what i should be doing. i am trying to relax right now so that i am not tense. stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes, health promotions, (eeh. my leg is shaking again!) nutrition and psychology. these classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter. i don't know why i kept avoiding this assignment. i have been putting it off. i think i feel incompetent when it comes to writing. it's not something i would consider myself skilled at. yes, writing intimidates me. i shouldn't think that i am so inferior. i bet ya'll don't even read these. hmm i wonder if you will read that sentence. maybe, maybe not. should i be using proper grammar and punctuation because i really like to go like this yeah i do it all the time when i am conversing over the internet. the internet. i'm suspicious of the internet. it can't be all that good. i spend way too much time online. just another distraction in this world that leads people away from the important things in life. i cannot possibly write all that i am thinking about, because random thoughts float in and out of my head and i can't type them all. and i forget them by the time i finished what i was typing. ok. six minutes. i'm suppose to be natural. i don't think i am. i wonder if i should stay on subjects longer, because i really want to. i don't like all this jumping around. i think the main thing is that it has to be continuous. well, that is easy. i'm always thinking. i think too much sometimes, if that's possible. you know what's been on my mind? i just got back from this scholarship dinner. i have no idea how i got that scholarship. i think they mixed up my name with someone else. i just seemed way under qualified compared to all the other recipients. wow! there are some amazing people here. some incredible smart and talented people, and i need to stop feeling inferior to them, because i have my good points also, and i am a very happy person. i'm content with my life. i wonder how many people really are struggling here. everyone seems like they are just fine and dandy, but you know some people are really sad. people can hide their emotions easily. i doubt thought that a third of the people in my psychology class are depressed. if that is true, than that is very sad. i will admit it; i am cynical of depression. yeah, sure everything is biological and you can trace it back to that and call it a disease, but really, your mind. that's where you control it. i keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous impact. do we not have control over our mind? that should be the one thing we do have control over, and that is where the power is. is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind? i think not. i guess that i'm not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good. close enough to perfect for me. i am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with. i had a good child hood, good parents. no worries really. but, it is not like i've never been depressed. i spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed, but now i look back and understand why i felt that way and how silly it was, and i don't plan on doing that again. i guess, you just have to live and learn. i mean it's ok to do what's wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it's wrong and fix it. ok. what was that all about? i ramble so much. it's hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it's in 10 places at once. i'm tired. i really am. i always feel a little tired. i had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school. it was horrible, and ever since then i get tired easily. maybe it's all in my head and i can convince myself that i'm not tired. i should try this. it could be very beneficial. i am already starting to procrastinate. why? why is procrastination and epidemic among youth? hey, i think time is up. i could go on for hours, but i really should get to my other homework. or not.

" i havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like i could write for a very long time. i do that though, i have a journal and its handy. i like to go back and read what i write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and i hope more people use journaling to express themselves. some people use online journals which at first i thought was odd because i write personal stuff in my journal. i wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then i started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. that reminds me of george, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. george makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. i am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and i swear he has pms. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and i didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. i don't know if i belive him but i really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. he is such a confusing boy. i mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, i knew what i was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now i feel bad like i'm just judging everyone i know. grr. that's a noise i make, i make many of them. i make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because i can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. i just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. i wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because i was of the opinion that i was getting an apartment so i wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man i was wrong. i visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while i was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions i'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now i miss them a lot. i was listening to avril lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home. and i realized that i have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out my cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. i like to claim that at least i'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like i tend to do. i took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said i was an estp? i think. anyway, part of it said that i would tell people what i think. i don't know how correct that is because i am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much all my friends will say crap. jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together i was quite angry. and still when i think about it i get angry at her. why not at him? i don't get that. but when i typed his name i accidentally wrote sew. i am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because i keep thinking of things. like today as i walked across campus i was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. i've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but i just. didn't. and now, even though i'm busy with papers to write etc, i really want to get creative. lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. i can't remember how badly it ran but i should probably check that before i buy one. i don't know how much they'll cost either. i think $150 at walmart? but i don't want a plastic one. i'm sure i could break it and i'd rather have machinery than plastic. i think i should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but i said that once and she said no way. whatev. i'm tired. i tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 i think. i don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks. and i've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that i hate my job. and this isn't like the first year i worked at culvers and i was just a lazy bum. i am good at my job, i do it well, i used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has been really hard to make myself go. and its not like i'm just going to call in sick, i just don't want to go. i want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. i don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, i know i'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago.

"there is alwaysa thought in out mind, or is there? do we only think when we are conciously aware of it, or do we think all the time? i ask myself a lot of stange question all the time. i hear the sound of a tennis match on the television. i wonder what the people at the tennis match are thinking? they are watching the game, but are they conciously thinking about it? i am sitting in my friend's dorm room, typing on her computer while she sits watching tennis, and doing calculus. i bet she is too distracted by tennis to actually """"do"""" her homework. that's ok. i am doing well at tuning it out, but then again, i don't really like tennis! i wonder how many people actually like tennis? i really have to use the restroom!i know that came out of no where, but i was thinking about it. you know that if you order things on line, if it's not in texas, well you have to pay s'h, but if you order a lot it can really save you money. i wish i made more money. i still don't know weather i should quit my current, cozy job, for a new strange one that pays more money? i have established a history, and many friendships at my current job, so why should i leave? but at the same time more money would help me out in the long run. or would i just spend more? that's is what our world seems to be all about making money, and for some, making the most money. i don't want to get caught up in the rat race of making money, but sometimes i am afraid that i already have. i should really be more conservative with my money so that i won't worry about having enough. i know that it's a vicious cycle. i wonder, will anyone actually read this? sorry, i ask many questions, i know that they will ever be answered, but i ask anyway. when will we find the answers? are the answers to many of lifes questions obtainable, or are we never to know? i think one day we will know these answeres, and we will say, """"wow, the answers were right in front of me the whole time!"""" sometimes i think that we make things too complicated! we should relax and let the answes come to us! that's what many artists have to do to become inspired, if they think to hard, then they can't think of anything! kind of crazy hu? well i think that this enough thought for today, have a great day!!

"it's crazy to think here i am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. i am now a college student. during high school i couldn't wait for it and now that i'm here i feel out of place. sure, i know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names i no longer remember, and i stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what i expected. the classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially ut. i have not had the success i had i hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that i am, i expected it to come easier. i tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. it makes me wonder if i should have rushed, though i do not see myself as a sorority girl. it seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. are they really paying for friendships? i do not think i would have fit in to such a place. i just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that i will meet some people with whom i really enjoy hanging with. i am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next monday. with 30 people in the class, i know i will get to know some of the other students. i never thought i would admit to being homesick, but it is true. though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. however, when we are there we tend to hate it. isn't it funny how that works? i have also decided that austin is a city full of beautiful people. everywhere i look, goodlooking boys and girls. it definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. i enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. should i really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? well, i do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. i believe i am finding competition in everything. whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people i know. the people i went to high school with. the people whom i now want to separate myself from. another thing i have noticed is how sleepy i always am. here i am at 12:22 writing this when i am insanely tired. but why go to sleep, when i do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. there are also a lot of sick people around. the allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere i have been. i have had a cough and a cold since i've been here. it seems like i have so many problems, but i know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. that is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. i know i need to give things time and make the best of what i have.

"i'm thinking i don't know what to write this popsicle tastes good, i'm really bored, my roommate is gone i'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything i'm thinking i miss my girlfriend and i should probably call her when i am done with this the popsicle tastes good. i hear the bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and i think it's kind of annoying. tonight is going to be fun, i am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good. i think i need to clean my room, it's really messy. i need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, i hear loud voices in the hall, i wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, i need to put my papers and homework away. i am going to get another popsicle. it tastes good too. i wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly. i am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest. i'm really bored. i think i will turn the radio on. never mind, i think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness. i hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody. i can't wait for that to start, but i am upset that i have to play coed instead of men's. this other popsicle is really good too. i feel papers in my pocket and i take them out, its my bank statements. that makes me upset because i see all the things i wasted my money on. i throw them on the floor. i'm thinking that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because i am looking forward to stop typing this. when i am done i think i will take a shower, and then maybe, i'm thinking about something interesting i can do after that, i'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that. i don't know, maybe i can figure something out when my roommate comes back. i'm hungry. now i'm eating chips. i'm laughing because i'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think i have an obsession with food, which i kind of do but that's just because i am hungry all the time. i really like the chips. i'm kind of sleepy too, maybe i'll take a nap. i was thinking about typing and how i am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because i haven't seen him in over a year. maybe i will call him this weekend i love chips and salsa, it's damn good. my roommate is going to be pissed because i am eating them all without him. it doesn't matter though because i am really hungry. 2 minutes left i can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but i want to do other stuff. i'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class. i really like these chips. well times up and now i'm really happy because i'm done.

" right now i am sitting here. the washing machine is very loud. my nose is really stuffy. i really like that band brandston that i saw the othernight. they were really nice and really cool. i can't wait until i get to hang out with steven. i really missed him while i was in austin. stupid nose itches. i don't understand why randi and i seem to not be as close anymore. its kind of sad. she has been my best friend for 5 years. its really ironic that steven is now my best friend. who would have ever thought? """"don't come crying back to me. when you're lonely and all out of love"""" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific song. its a very nice song. very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting. i can't believe that i still have 17 minutes left to type. its usually very hard for me to type stream of consciousnes, i've tried it before in a humanities class for some reason. i can't ever seem to really put what i'm thinking on paper. that's why its hard for me to write or keep a journal. i even lie to myself on paper. i wonder why. i also wonder why mikey is the way he is with me. i can't believe i ran into him last night. he completely ignored me. that really hurts my feelings because we were really close. at least i thought so. i really need closure. i hate myself for not hating him. my nose is running again now. it's getting in the way of my typing. i am so stressed out right now about biology. the house is completely silent right now except for the washing machine. the dorm is never this quiet. i think maybe that's why i like the dorm. because its loud. ow, i just hit my ear that i just pierced. its really sore. the pain only lasts for a split second though. its not as hot here in amarillo as it is in austin. the weather here for labor day is perfect. i think i will go and walk my dogs. i just sneezed again. i am sick of sneezing. stupid allergies. i need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework. i also need to read chapters 3 and 4 for psychology. i am behind. i am so worried about my biology. i don't understand it and because of that i am not focusing as hard on my other classes. however, government should be easy. i've taken that class before. psychology is fun, but i really do not know what to expect on my tests. i don't know how i will do in that class. i thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy at all. someone is getting ice from the refrigerator. i can hear it. wow, does my mind really jump this much? that's really interesting. i guess i am sort of truly typing in a stream of consciencous. am i even spelling that right? i usually can spell. i feel like everyone else at ut is smarter than i am. i am not used to that. i'm always the smartest. no one here knows my reputation. no one knows that i am smart. but maybe i'm not smart. maybe i am just lucky. my little puppy shinobi isn't eating anymore. maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday. i really missed my dogs. zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me. he licked me all over. i love dogs so much. but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people. other dogs like me more. just my luck. i had to explain what i am doing to my mom. this is all interesting. the fan is on now. my legs are cold. i think i'm sick. i want to listen to my new cd again. i can't believe that i got to talk to further seems forever and get put on the guest list for another show of theirs. too bad i didn't go. i can't believe mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them. oh well, he is probably just tying to be """"emo"""" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with the people that he holds up on a pedestool. why did i ever date a guy like that? and why am i still so attracted to such a stupid jerk? i hate people like him. why has he changed? my stomach is hurting now again. i don't like being sick. i need paper in order to print. and a usb cable. i hate that my printer doesn't work in my dorm. i brought it for nothing. i bought some new cartridge too. its all a waste. i can't return it. well for thanksgiving or something i will bring the printer home and have my dad try to fix it. being home doesn't feel like home really. just feels like i'm visiting. which is really what i'm doing. my nose is itching again, i think i am going to sneeze again. i feel like i've been typing for 2 hours. someone just opened something. i don't hear my dogs anymore. i wonder what they are doing. my stomach is still hurting. the air conditioner just turned on. i heard it. i don't usually hear these things. that's strange. my eyes are drooping. i'm tired. i haven't slept well for a couple days. why does he hate me? i really wish i would just be brave and confront him. i always say i'm going to, and i really think that i am going to, but then i chicken out and if anything, i am extremely nice to him only to have him ignore me. further seems forever was so good the other night. the energy around me at the concert was so good. i was up in front. that was great. the new lead singer was great. i need to go to more places like that in austin. i just typed that sentence with my eyes closed. i am really falling asleep. my parents are talking. i can hear them. my dad is selling my car. that makes me sad because i really like my car. even though i am getting a better car.

"stream of consciousness. somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's """"a light in august"""" we read that nnovel in my senior ap english class and although iit was a touch on the boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. well i'm in my dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. i. e: when i'm trying to take a nap. our refrigerator is in the closet. it was in the middle of the room, but my roommate moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. my roommate's name is ricky and he's been out of town this weekend as far as i can tell. he kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his family. i think he's from laredo, but i could be mistaken. ricky is dating a girl named natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. because it smells like crap! which sucks, because it's a really expensive dolce and gabbana or however you spell it. it really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to everything in our room. especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like him. oh i hate it. i always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that his designer cologne smells like ass and that i could make the scent personally with some onions and curry. god! i've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of weeks, but haven't exactly found one. well i found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at what the times are for mass or whatever. my dad is really pushing me to start going to church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a jesus freak. he's not bad, but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. for instance, i joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it simply because he doesn't like fraternities. but he doesn't exactly say why. and since he's never been in one i don't see how he can make such a judgement. oh well, my dad and i went camping this weekend. we like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a place called reimer's ranch. so we found a new camp site called krause springs and it was really nice. so we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever. but me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that i took the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the ground. it was pretty bad, but i made it through. only got about 3 and a half hours of sleep though. ughh. oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed to reimer's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. but we didn't give up hope and went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got to do one route because it started to rain. so after that our hopes were pretty much shot so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and i took a nap that i just woke up from about 20 minutes ago. so my weekend was pretty lackluster but it'll be ok because i know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. oh well. my mom just called me a second ago and i was like, """"can i call you right back? i'm doing a project"""" and she's so understanding and just said """"bye"""" really quick so after i'm done with this thingy i'll call her back. i've actually been keeping in touch with my mom pretty well since i moved here which has been nicer than i imagined it would. i expected it to be annoying talking to her too much but i was mistaken. i've also been talking to my sister via email which has been fun. she's so funny and always has something to say, but whenever i call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and i just ask for mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. i know it's weird, but the thing i miss the most about home is my dog. i have a full-blooded springer spaniel named lola and she's such an awesome dog. i miss her so much, but i'm hoping that if i live in a frat house next year i can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. oh well, i guess we'll see ",0
"he will be nineteen this saturday. i think i am going to go crazy trying to get something for the boy who has everything. he just left my dorm room. and we just had a fight. he is going to his apartment to check if his dog made a mess on the carpet. i think he likes his dog more than me sometimes. i am listening to the soundtrack of the tape that i do yoga to because it soothes me. when i do yoga i am so calm. i actually feel very centered and like my whole body is in a perfect line when have finished the whole tape, its an hour long and it really is a workout. my mom got me started on yoga, she's totally addicted now. i am too, but i'm going into withdrawal because there is nowhere in the castilian where i could do it. i am going home to dallas this weekend and i'll get to see my whole family!! my mom will make some really good dinner for me because she thinks i'm starving here. i'm not but there's just nothing good to eat. everybody loves the food that their mom cooks them though. i went home last weekend too. the people down the hall are being so noisy . i want to change this cd, i think i just fell into a trance. i do think i was in a trance this morning in biology. my roommate was up until 6 this morning doing some paper and she kept waking me up. she takes a lot of my stuff without asking , and that's not cool. oh well , she's cool otherwise. i've got other homework to start now so i don't keep her up tonight!!!

"i can't ever seem to remember my passwords. and this lack of remembrance has really started to effect my disposition. everytime i try to log on to a computer, i can't remember one password from the other and it has gotten to the point where i just want to kick myself in the head. most of the time i just want to lie down and go to sleep. people keep on staying over in my apartment and i just can't get any sleep in the night. i can't survive with this for much longer. sometimes, i wish i was going to a faraway place where no one knows me and i can remain anonymous forever. i don't have to wash dishes for my roommates friends or clean up after anyone. i also wish that my parents would trust me everyonce in a while. i know my limits. i care enough about myself and my future to not screw it up. before, i didn't care about much anything but lately i've come to realize this lack of compassion, even for a moment, has adverse effects. i've come to realize that every second matters and every second can be utilized and it is only when you are satisfied that you were ahead in some way this second than the last is the only way to truly be content. humans, especially the ones here, are really ignorant of some basic kindness. they seem to forget that they are not the only ones with feelings. and they also think that they know nothing of what they are doing to you when they know perfectly clear. butterfly in the sky. i think most birds can fly twice as high. i was sitting in the chem auditorium in welch and it just hit me the magnitude of this university. it's freaking huge. there are more people in that auditorium then in my graduating class. i'm pretty sure i'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome. all this typing since the last 5 years constantly plus all the ones in the next 50 years will have some sort of negative effect. i want to dye my hair brown. but then i'll be just like every other indian. there are more indians here than in all of the rest of america combined. after caucasians, indians seem most prevalent. dell and gates signed a deal for a huge merger. it was one of those things which i don't really care about. everyone makes fun of gates but i don't see why. the man is worth billions. he could have people killed. at the moment, there's no one i'd like to injure severely, i think i just might want to kick a few of them in the head.

"these past couple of weeks i have felt kind of out of place. not that i haven't been having fun and meeting new people just that it is taking some time to adjust to everything. i sometimes think that i have too much going on and that i need to quit something. between school, texas pom, and soroity i am always on the go, and i never have time to just sit and relax. however, when i get a little time to just relax, all my friends start to come in my room and ask me to go do something or just talk. i don't want to be rude about it, because i don't know all them well enough to know how they would react. for example, i've been feeling sick lately and i really should stay home and get some rest tonight, but all of my pledge sisters are going to a mixer tonight, and i feel that i should go with them. i don't really want to go, but i feel like i need to meet some more people and not let my pledge sisters down. i know that they understand, but i also feel that they might think that i don't like to go out and have a fun time with them. these thoughts have also led me to revaluate why i did texas pom. we have to practice so much a week that i have to miss some of my pledge meetings and give up time that i could use to study or rest. however, i love the girls on the squad and all of the fun that we've had together so far. also, the games are such a rush and make me feel so privalleged to be out there on that field. i would feel like i was letting the whole team down if i quit something that i've been committed to a lot longer than my soroity. plus my coach has been so understanding lately with the adjustments that i'm going through, that it would be hard for me to tell him that i might want to quit. i guess i just need to sit down and eveluate all of the options that i have right now, or maybe just give it another couple of weeks to get adjusted before i make a decision.

"when i first decided to go back to school i knew from my current job at texas school for the blind that i wanted to enrich my knowledge in the fields of the social and psychological sciences. i soon realized that most of the more detailed social science classes required psy 301. this brings us to the present. i have always had a strong interest in the ways and whys of peoples reactions to life. since i was a young girl people have come to me for answers to questions on their lives or advice of different content. supplying folks with this help has never over taxed my own brain and i have even found it to be very rewarding. i always chalked my natural abilities up to my own experiences as a child. i was ordered by law to see a psychologist because of the fighting of my parents over my sister and myself. i did the rohrshac(inkblot test) , the what do you see in the clouds thing and many other """"buzz"""" tests of the day (circa mid 1970's). anyway, these test never showed my little 5,6,7, and 8 year old psyche to be under too much mental duress and i was an above average student at school. i even skipped lessons in 1st grade and was moved to 2nd because i knew how to read. however, since the death of my father last year and the pre-grieving of watching someone be taken by aids, my need to make heads or tails out of some of the reasons and whys my own life has unfolded as it has , has become an intensified desire i must look further into.

"ok, i am starting writing for 20 min. my thought, are what i am writing about. right now i am still thinking about visiting my friends at baylor this weekend, not sure if i want to do that. i have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what i have to do. most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why i am thinking about visiting baylor. i have to be back at 5 sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, also stephanie wanted me to visit ev free sunday morning with her, so if i do that i will want to leave saturday afternoon, so i am not sure, i still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 3,4 in cs, chapter 2 in psy, i need to do that today, maybe after i go run, i think i will go to baylor tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. and get stuff done, i need to work on that song, that reminds me i need to go get those birkenstocks as well, anyway i want to see blake and lauren and the game but i don't know if i will have much time, maybe i can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals i have been meaning to get, then i can still go out on sat night, maybe with jacqueline or susan, most everyone went back to see dave, i wish i was seeing dave, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and i was not in town to get them. oh well, i can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant gnc on tuesday, i may go run then work out a while today i want to figure out what i am doing tonight first though. blake said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. so i am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, i need to work out defiantly this weekend. hmmm, i wish i could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, ashley keeps asking me to come visit her, which i should do but i am lazy, hah, i have no time for anything anymore, i squeeze in homework and studying, i need to do something about that, i would like to see ashley though, i kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than i thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, i guess i have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl i have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, anne was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, i need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. i guess i will skip workout today and just go up at about 2:30 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore i thought would be. i just have weekend plans on my mind so i can't think of much else. psy is fun, i need to be a little less tired monday so i can enjoy it, i will work on that. over and out.

"i hope i am doing this write! i never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. i feel better now that i am actually doing this, i thought i wouldn't figure it out in time then i would get a zero and bring my grade down. i am a freshman and i really want to do good. i hope my roommate isn't wandering where i am. we were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at5. i was glad it wasn't raining when i got out because i didn't bring my umbrella. i am kind of upset that i couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one i brought. i don't want to look like a dork. i miss my boyfriend he is in san antonio where i am from. i wish he would've gotten in to ut like me. it would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. my time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that i have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. i not a very fast typer so i hope i have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever i am thinking. well thank god i am almost done i only have one more minute so i have to push the submit button before it cuts me off. bye.

"i'm really hungry. i'll have to go shopping after this. i don't know what to write. i really need to catch up on my reading today. i don't know why i always leave things to the last minute. i was going to try to keep up with things this year but i'm not doing a real goodd job. i have to do computer science tommorrow. that will be easy. i should have called darcie and megan this weekend and hung out with them. kyle should have come up too. i'm surprised i got mike to come hang out last night since he almost never leaves his apartment. i really want to go smoke but i probably shouldn't. i need to cut down. i wish i could think of a place to put these stickers. i had to kill a spider but i missed him. what weas up with all those spider questions in the pretesting. pretesting took a long time. and it seemed like a lot of pointless questions. i need to go sign up for experiments. there sure are a lot of beer cans lying around. i need to get everything cleaned up in here. i haven't finished unpacking yet. i have to go look for a job tommorrow. i wish i didn't have to work, but it will be good for me. i won't waste so much time hopefully. damn, i haven't been writing very long. i hate doing these things cause if i'm thinking about writing everything i think, then i don't think normally. i wrote think too much. there's so much shit i have to do. and i don't want to do it. i'll probably end up not doing any homework again today just cause i don't have to have it done yet. i can't wait to get out of school. i wonder if anyone will actually read this. if so, what's up. i'm getting tired of writing. i'm so hungry. i should start clipping coupons to take with me. i guess it'll make a big difference and i don't have a lot of money. i wonder what my sister's doing. i should start taking some more pictures. i haven't really done any of that for a while. i wonder what's on that roll of film in my camera. it's been in there so long i don't know what i took pictures of. okay about five more minutes. shit. i wonder where i should try to get a job. hopefully something fun but i don't know what. i feel like i should have more written down for twenty minutes. oh well at least i did something. i don't want to write anymore.

"well here i am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. i don't like hearing music while i work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. i have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. i don't need music in there screwing things up while i'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as i do. i keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that i neeed or want or should do. but will i ever get to them? sometimes i think i will never be bored. i would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, """"hey, i have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. """" that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps i will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that i am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do something that my mind tells me should be done. even if i had no school work, even if i finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then i'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated """"projects. """" to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. i'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. i'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible? that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streams of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. i could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy i am, how stressed my life is right now. i could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. i could speak of the things i want in life -- the never ending flow of """"man i want to do that someday""""s. i could gripe. i could gripe about anything and everything. i could turn philosophical. i could question. i could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet i am thinking of them all at once. so how do i transcribe that? and then i look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. i have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how i love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. i wish i had written more as a kid. i wish i had kept a journal. i did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. i can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why i find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. i wish i had more time. i wish i could make everyone happy. i think i could if i had the time. i'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and i wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. i never get anything done it seems when i start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. i guess i should; it's saturday night. but hell, i went out every night this week it seems. why should i go out this night as well just because it's saturday. i should stay and work. i guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and i said yes. if i hadn't of been waiting for him, then i wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that i need to finish this writing assignment. argh! i can't stand not to proofread things. i'm such a perfectionist. i had to make sure that word was spelled right. i can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but i guess i will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap! that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but i will rebel; i will leave it be. i will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition) perhaps i should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if i didn't worry so much things would be much easier. i stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until i thought about it again. i guess i should relax in life. i guess i should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. i guess i shouldn't proofread this. i guess i should just hit that submit button.

" for the past two weeks, i've been down here in austin, tx, home of the largest university in the nation, and while i thought that i would have the time of my life, i cannot seem to move past the feeling that i am completely alone in a world of 50,000 students. i had wanted to come to this university for five years, but now that i'm here, im constantly thinking of ways to either get out or somehow to get used to it. the fact is, i left my friends. although this is something that everyone going to college is faced with, the friends i left were the only ones that i had kept for more than 4 years since my family moved around often. and this time, leaving them was actually my decision! i continually tell myself to just give it time and i will find my place. however, as i struggle being in a new city by myself, it seems that everyone that i talk to is having the time of their lives: the time that i wanted and expected to have upon arrival in austin. wanting to transfer closer to where my friends are occuppies much of my thoughts each and every day. i just can't move past it. it's as if the world is moving on without me. i feel as if i'm lost, and i don't know how to find myself again. either i stay here and attempt to find the dream i had expected, or i find a way out of the city. everyone seems so happy. why can't i be like them? i miss everything about my home, but most of all i miss how familiar everything was. i knew what was going to happen every day, and here, i don't know what to do with myself! anyway, i really wish my roommate would come home every now and then! i hardly see her. i miss my boyfriend so much! i sound like such a typical teenage girl in saying that, but it's true. i miss my life before college. i hadn't realized how happy and lucky i truly was to have such amazing friends and family close by all the time. perhaps i just need to get out there and truly find someone to talk to, but it feels like i've tried that already. i wish so much that i could just meet someone and right away have a friend! it's ridiculous to think that way, but honestly, the world would be a much friendlier place! okay, so now it seems like i'm just rambling on. i should go running sometime soon, but it's extremely hot outside!! i cannot wait for this weekend because i have a ride home. see, i continually come back to this topic. i desperately hope that i maintain the same relationship with my friends. i feel so stressed out lately. i don't know what to expect yet from college, and calculus is absolutely killing me! if i don't get an extremely high gpa, i might have to transfer universities in order to get accepted into business. why couldn't my life have just stood still during my senior year of high school? i loved it, only i didn't know that i had the life i always wanted until i was forced to leave it and start over. i sound as if my life is falling apart, and it's not. sometimes i just feel too overwhelmed with making new friends and meeting new people, keeping in touch with everyone and wishing they were here with me, and then there's the little fact that i'm supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my life at some point soon! business is just so general, so i thought it would be a great starting point. who knows? definitely not me. i'm so confused right now. people are outside running right now. i should get out there and attempt to keep in shape.

"first of all i don't have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and i can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. i am worried however about how well i do in college. although i did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how i cram all my assignments into the night before it's due, i plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends i don't think i'll have much time to do studying or productive work. i am hoping that by writing all of this down, i am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness i can't help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since i'm in psychology, i hope that doesn't mean that i'm going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and i feel many of holden's feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off! back to college, i hope that i can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now i'm listening to red hot chili peppers. i don't know what that tells about me, but i love their older songs. i can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh! four more minutes. i don't know what to write. i have so many thoughts but they're not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it's the first day of class, that's on my mind. the crazies passing out the christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because i'm catholic. what pisses me off is that they're so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!) that disgusts me. although i do drink a little, i don't go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. i view many of their views such as religion's role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we've had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions i see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their religion) that catholics worship mary when in fact we pray through her. they see that as a way of discrediting catholicism by pointing out verses in the bible stating that """"thou shall worship no other god than me"""" or something like that.

"i can't believe what i just did i wrote my thoughts all in that process of stream of consciousness and realized i didnt' put my social security number or name. it got sent though, so i don't know what to do now. all these problems are so fixable and avoidable. just in case i'm going to do it all again anyway. i guess i'll just type what i wrote last time unless i have a big interrupting thought. it worries me that i don't know where i'm going in life. when i get an idea i start doubting myself an thinking i'm not competent. friends seems msasrter than me. am i just too analytical or self conscious to break out of my shell? i need to eat i'm so hungry and i have to go to rowing meeting in an hour. am i capable of going to medical school? can i openmy own practice someday? will myrace hold me back? is it an advantage or disadvantage? both? whycan't i look like everyone else? i'm different. i wish i was unque. i'm a walking contradiction. one day i want to be different the other i just want to be like everyone else. i mean i where gap like evvvvery day and that's the most mainstream you can get. i miss thomas. i miss the way he always made me feel like a good person. i loved him. now i love him more like as a friend but i definitely miss the fun times we've had. i wish i had a boyfriend like him again. excpet a bit different for variety. i hate angela. best friends since 5th grade and look what she did to me. she hurt me sooooo much. she punched me over and over. and i knew i could kick her puny ass but i loved her too much. now i look back and wish i never even associated with her. she's such a punk. i bet she'd like me more now if she saw me. now i'm more liek her. more bitter, more volitle. did i spell that right? i miss her though. we had good times. church camp. haha, imagine her at camp now. she'd set us all on fire instead. it's only been six minutes and it feels like an hour. i can't believe i did this assignment wrong. it's not one of those things you put in the right answers because if that's the case, i wouldn't have to wait a whole 20 minutes. i like this assignment though. psychology is the first class that didn't put me to sleep. i'm glad. it's going to be my major probably. except those dumb blondes kept commenting and chatting about everything. so annoying. for the past few minutes all i've been doing is bitching and moaning about how awful i feel and how awful life is to me. you'd never know i was considered freakin' beautiful, popular, social, likable, homecoming princess, varsity athlete since frosh year. damn, i really had this act going strong. what's with christina aguilera trying to act all ghetto now? she's freakin blonde blue eyed little shrimp with a big voice. don't let your careeer go down the ghetto tube like freakin sleazy mariah carey! is she still in the hospital? poor thing to think about, she's so pretty and got such a wonderful voice, but ever since she split from tommy mattola she got yucky. celine dion is so tantelizing. is that the right way to use that word? i used to be so religious andf now i'm not at all. damn school course religion and philosophy. now i'm lost man. lost as a freakin fish in a bowl of nothingness. haha, am i getting bad and poetic? i wish i had a way with words like some gifted talented folks. i wonder if i'd be this unhappy if i lived in oregon still. i miss oregon. i don't miss the bullshit with that crowd but i miss certain things about it. i hope dad gets a raise soon because he deserves one. i hope diana finds what she's looking for. she said she's depressed. michelle thinks she's bi. mom said she wants to kill herself. this 8 minutes is going to go sloooow i'm telling you. people aren't as friendly here. liz is so perfect, funny that she's so down on herself. she's a perfectionist that's why. she became anorexic. she stopped getting her period, her skin got bad, and she became socially inept all the sudden. she is another one of those people who are surrounded by people but might feel very alone. i heard that psychologists have a problem stemming in their own life and to help other people is a subconcious way of letting that go. i believe it because i'm like that. i want to help people feel good, i want to listen to them. i'm one of those people who constantly remind themselves to ask about how the other person's day was since i find myself focusing on myself too much. i ask questions that i want asked of me. that's so selfish. ok i think i'm nearly done, but this is taking so long. ahhhh. . devon, left the group . good thing too. but she's hanging out with the wrong crowd again i think. matt marino is such a pothead. i wish he was here too so that we can hangout. i want a car. i want that white jeep back. i wish i had a sweet car, a cell, and computer. a fully-paid tuition grant whatever. i need it. there's so many people that don't but oh well. i think that's all.

"well i guess i begin. anyway, i don't really have a clue as to what i'm thinking or feeling at the moment actually. i'm hoping that the psychology computer gets this even though i'm not saving it in word processor but whatever. i had a good day today well i guess. i went to mason's funeral. things just. well. i can't really place how i feel about that. well i'm upset, but can't place exactly why. but i don't feel like talking about this. i'm interested in the weirdness and indecisiveness of my mind. my husband just walked over here to check out what i'm writing. he only had to read the first few sentences to figure out exactly or should i say how inexactly my mind works. now, why does it work like that? your guess is as good as mine. but whatever. i wish i had a game of some sort. maybe just a pet to play with. i love my husband very very much anyway my friend reggie used to write sort of like this in a metaphorical way. anyway. i feel like i'm throwing off the experiment by writing stupid shit. perhaps in another place another time will unfold to a utopia that sings the praise of wrath in a time where pain is nonexistent but perhaps that makes no sense. but anyway i guess i'll keep on typing what pops into this head of mine or theirs or his or hers. from laura's box or my box. i hope lisa gets my time card i'm pretty sure i turned it in but i can never really be sure of anything. now can i? so i'll continue about the unicorns of relentlessness and the dwarfs of forgetfulness while i sing. la. la. la. but to be exact well my mind seems to be shutting down. i don't have thoughts all the time like most people. the only person i've met who doesn't either is my mom wait but maybe i have thoughts that are just on hold or don't ever quite make it to where my interpreters can interpret my interpretations of the world around me. but anyway i believe in god i believe in nothing also. but how can that be. it's a """"metaphysical can of worms"""" that we've just opened up now isn't it no i'm not. it hasn't been twenty minutes yet yep that's right. sorry to burst your bubble but that's what i want to do anyway i happen to be learning quite a bit about myself at this point. in fact this is rather therapeutic. what would he write if he had to write for twenty minutes i think that these should be anonymously posted so that i can feel better knowing that someone is just as nutty as i am. or even that i'm not ridiculous. anyway i doesn't. blah blah so ",1

"as i am writing this, the red sox are playing the a's. i think this really may be the year for the sox. i hope so because how cool would it be to see the """"curse of the bambino"""" broken. their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching. they look like the 1996-2001 yankees. i'm ready for a world championship for my sox. i just read an email from home, from my dad. i miss him, just having someone around to talk to. i guess i am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad that i do, most guys don't. i mean, not many people have the kind of dad who taught them how to play sports and things like that, but i have vivid memories of being 8 and 9 years old and my dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the ferry. with football season starting, i really realize how much i miss the game. i mean, it's been 6 years since i didn't play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting hard. i miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of friday nights, being the captain. i miss d a lot too. we had such a crazy fall last year, always know that we should be together but never being able to get it right. i miss 8th periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking. i miss saturdays, the days after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with micah. i've been gone 3 weeks, and i'm not homesick, i'm just kind of missing the crew. i miss meghan a lot. for 4 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and i really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that i am one of the biggest things in her life too. which is good, because i really cannot see either of us drifting away from the other. i hope andrew is doing ok. i'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him. he really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention for being the """"big guy"""", the built guy. a school like this would be terrible for his self-esteem. but oh well, whatever floats your boat, right? i really hope micah does ok. that kid has never been in a social group or circle that i didn't bring him into. he may really struggle with finding his niche at school. i hope not thought, he's my best friend and i need him to be self-confident and happy so i can stop worrying about him. i can never really tell if worrying about people is a good thing or a waste of time. i worry so much about meghan, with her mother walking out on her and everything. and meghan is so reclusive when it comes to her emotions, even to me. it betrays her every once in a while thought, when i have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a basic human reaction'emotion out of her. i hope d is doing ok. being the only one of us not to go to college has to take it's toll on her. but from what she says, she is getting her act together. i just couldn't take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy as lee. thank god she's finally going in the right direction. maybe i won't have to live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road somewhere. of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me. going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does making me feel satisfied that i am having an impact in someone's life. or, a lot of someone's. i really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that i invest so much of myself into those people. and i really believe it has paid off. my family seems to being doing well. i'm glad. the girls will be back in school soon, and next year maggie will be in my position. that's crazy. go sox.

" i know i said that i was ready to write but im not too sure exactly what i need to be doing. i hope this is right. great now im worrying. i worry way too much that is a problem of mine. i always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it i even worry about other people's problems. i wish i could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend joseph. he's also my roommate. now im now sure if this is right because im telling you about myself when im just supposed to be thinking. okay now im thinking. why is my room so hot. sometimes its not hot but right now im boiling. i think it is because i am nervous about this assignment. theres no reason to be i just need to type. well here i am typing. my room smells funny right now. joseph bought some cinna sticks from dominoes a while back and i think that they are going bvad. i know they are going bad. i need to take out the trash than. i hate that i get lazy and don't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob. great now i propbably sound all anal about mess when im not at all like that. well im not a messy person but you know. gosh reading over this i sound like such a pessimist and so boring. oh well. time sure is going by pretty slow. i want to make jell-o but i don't think i have room in fridge for it. gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now. i wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o . like how does it form the way it does? whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o. one day im going to find out. more than likely i won't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that im gooing to look into it. it makes me feel productive. im worried about my financial situation right now. i still have almost 4000 to pay off and i got a loan for that and all but i don't know where that money is or who i need to talk to in order to get my hands on it. tomorrow i guess ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that. i can't think of anything else right now. i feel like im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am i to say no. this should be an easy a or at least i hope. i hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because i said easy a then im going to get like a b or something. just in case im sorry even if this seems easy i do my work and i dedicate time so when it comes down to it, i think i deserve that a . great im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. i wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? i doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. but then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. is lenient even a word? oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was ms. ng, she scored perfect on her sat's. how the heck did she ever pull that off. and since she did i have no idea why shes teaching at edison. in case you dopnt know which you probably don't edison is a public inner-city school in san antonio and it does not have the best of reputations. i hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? and that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond edison . esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from edison. well thats their loss because im a great person to know and i don't fit the edison stereotype. there should be no stereotypes. they are just not fair. hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up. just 35 more seconds. 30 now. wow this is actually good stress relief i should do this more often when i have time.

"it might be a good idea to join a coed frat for engineers because then maybe i will get some studying done and actually get help on my calculus from someone who knows more than i do. a bagel sounds good right now since i haven't eaten lunch yet, but not will jelly, i think i will have philly cheese instead. this place is a mess, if my roommates leave anymore of their curlers and hairdryers on the floor when i get home, i think i will have a cow. that's okay, they are great roommates, they always do the dishes and for the more part are considerate of my belongings. here on out i am going to eat healthier and exercise a bite more than i have been lately. i hope by me playing more racquetball lately will not effect my previous tennis skills. rob will die if i do get better because he hates to loss. that would be so funny if i could kick his butt in racquetball, but then he would be pretty upset. although i think i can relate to his family more than i can to him. his head is in the clouds will all of that philosophy he reads. i can't understand why someone would pick a worthless major like philosophy when all you can do is write a book or teach. why not do something with your life which you can apply and gain new knowledge from. besides i think everyone should have to take philosophy, because there are basic ideas everyone should just know, but not to major in. my roommates are home, i have to close my door. they are so loud, i think i suppose to cook tonight, looks like i need to go to the grocery. i think chicken, pasta, and some kind of bread, oh yeah, and a salad of some sort will be good tonight. i need to make sure they eat something later so lessen the affects alcohol will have on their bodies. i am so sick of drunk people anyways. all of those girls that came by last night, were all drunk by the end of that crappy box wine. anyways, it is gorgeous outside, i hope to find time to swim in the pool i haven't yet been in, i feel like i live in a resort living here, we have everything. i have a great life. i live two of the most wonderful people, i have a family who completely supports me and a boyfriend and school and everything. the little things in life for the most part i enjoy and i having freedom, enough to make any grateful person happy. and even if i don't have all these things, there is plenty to be grateful for. too many good things, great food, great wine and genuine love. although these enjoyments wouldn't be the same with the not so enjoyable things. i love life, no destination, just a journey and one that you can turn in any direction you want. life is what you want it to be. but i don't want to get caught up in idealistic idea, but should keep my feet on the. my roommate came in, no thank you. what was i thinking, oh yes. keep my feet on the ground by also being realistic, and many think that being realistic is the same idea as being pessimistic, i differ. maybe those are the people who are actually ",0
"tomorrow we're going to see carrie, i'm really excited, i think but then there's also being anxious about it. i know i should be happy and in many ways i am, it's just weird. because i mean things with lisa have been on the weird side lately adn i don't think it's going to get any easier. maybe it's only this period of transition. i'm glad that lisa's comign out of her shell, i guess i'm still not wanting to. but then thea'ts not really something i like doing. typing on the keyboards makes little to no sense. at least with eva's keyboard, it's letters are separated, i wonder how she writes like that. i hate my dingy old omsputer though its so crappy i wish i could get s\a new one, but theen it'd be bad wasting it on some money. i wonder who that professors in waking life was. matthew said he teaches at ut but i guess it'd be hard to find him. there are al million billion people on campus. which has been weird cause i've been seeing people that i didn't really think i'd see again. i don't quite know what to do about that. i wish that john and i were better friends so we could hang out somewhere away from here and everything in my life wouldn't be so complicated and connected for once. i wonder what he thingsk of me, i hope i'm not imposing too much, i gues its been a while since there has been someone that's really interested me and i wish i could make him be interestedd in me too. i think its that need for love that we all have that makes me get this way. i guess i'd feel much better if i had someone that could hold my hand and listen to everything. i wish on some level i could be taht way with matthew, but when i'm with him, its so much more different. oh god. i'm only been writing for 6 minutes? what am i supposeed to write about. i wonder if this will give me writer s cramps. that carpal tunnel ? syndrome. i doubt it. but i don't know this is probly the most work i've had to do for a class so far. that and going to cnetral market, which wasn't too bad. i don't see all the glamour of central market yet, but who knows maybe it's there. i'm glad that i know some people in my classes, at least in my art related classes. theatre and psychology are other things. i wnat to be able to go up and talk to someone, but its so freaking intimidating. i think i'll make it a point next time to come early so i can get a good seat. i just wish i wasn't so tired all the time so i could really enjoy those classes. i thought i'd be spending alot more time being intellectually stimulated than i have been since classes startedd. maybe it just takes aw hile. i dunno, i still miss some aspects of high school. god, that sounds lame. and i know it is on most levels, i just miss how easy it was. but maybe not. the latter part of high school was hell. especially senior year. and really before senior year. i can't believe i still think about him sometimes. i must be liek the biggest loser in the world. i wonder if its because of him that i'm still get malfunctioney sometimes. but most days, i know for sure that's not true. maybe i just need someone or something to constantly be thinking about. like i need some drama in my life so i create it for myself by bringing up something that really bothered me even though its way in the past. i can't spend all this time and energy trying to analyze myself. it gets exhausting. i just should forget about it sometimes and just have funn. but then that gets you to be too so-called shallor . . that's really lame. i should just not be this way. i don't know. its not like i really think this way all the time. maybe i do but i guess it just seems different when actually writing out ideas as they come. i guess thats what i did with paper journal. thought i've become too lazy to keep up with one. i wonder how anna is doing. i'm glad she keeps in touch with carrie at least. in my aspect i totally understand why she wouldn't make too great of an effort to talk to me. god, i'm such an ass sometimes. hmm. . maybe i should eat ramen. it was so good today. but i dunno, that would mean i got to go work out or something and i know i'll regret it later. i'm tired of worrying about weight but then the flabbiness is not good to look at. i wonder how really obese peopel can live. i mean, not to be rude, but i feel really bad for them. if i were in their position and had trouble with just like moving around and stuff i might just die. aimee is going to sleep and this static crap is annoying the shit oputta me. i guess that's that whole buyy cheap. less quality thing. god but now its' like louder than ever. there headphones off muuuuuch better. my computer is so stupid. makes too much noise. i want to meet john someday. i hope he writes back soon. i guess i was kind of a big jerk for waiting so long to write to hiom. gosh, i hate that. it could have been fixed and we could be writing each other back and forth like we used to. . but noo. . i'm a big freaking idiot. ahh maybe i shouldn't try so hard. he's different than most guuys i know, i think. and i dunno, i really would like to see him one day. at least as friends, even though that might be kind of big and scary. maybe we'll just keep corresponding through email. that would be enough to keep me happy. i think. it's just weird giving so much of yourself so honestly and candidly and without prided or shame to someone you have never seen in real life. though, la ",1
"right now i'm sitting here at the computer wondering what i'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. there is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. my computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. i keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! there is a lot of stuff on my desk, i need to clear it off. i also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. i forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. i need to study for chemistry because i have a quiz in there at 12:30. i tried to last night, but i kept on getting distracted. i don't feel like doing this right now. i want to go to sleep. i just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all i want to do is sleep. by the time i get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. i can't think of anything to type. i want to light a candle. i have a lot of time left and i still need to write. i'm not sure what about though. this weekend i'm not sure what i'm going to do, but i guess i'll have fun. i did last weekend. i need to do some reading for my classes, and i can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that i don't have any classes on friday. right now i am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in houston. we plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and dag are planning it. next weekend i am going to the ut houston game and then right after that i plan on going home because the 24th is my dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. that will be a busy weekend. the following one is my friend's birthday. my computer is still making some annoying noise. i can't think of anything to type. i have 10 minutes left of typing. hopefully i can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. i'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because i noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. that would be very annoying to deal with, if i lived there! so i'm glad i don't. yesterday there was a lot of traffic. today i get out of school at 3:30 and i have a trig review class at 5:30. i wish i didn't have to go, but i get extra credit for my calculus class, which i figure i will need. i need to balance my checkbook. i think i'll do that when i finish typing this. i'm going to listen to some cd's when i finish this too. i don't feel like studying, and i guess i'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. i wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, i'll have to check that out in a minute. my desk is really cluttered, i need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that i keep on forgetting about. well, i have a lot more stuff to do than i thought! it's driving me crazy that i keep on making so many typos, i never have this problem. wow, i've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! that's kind a cool. i thought that a i would have written more in 20 minutes though. i guess not. surprisingly the time went by very quickly, i didn't think that it would. i guess in a minute i will log on so that i can get on to the psychology website and send this in.

"stream of consciousness i have had a very rough week this week. i never dreamed that i would be so busy at college with classes and fraternity engagements; at least not on the weeknights. i feel that the sleep depravation may begin to catch up with me. perhaps as time passes i will learn how to better manage my time on campus. it does not help that i have little, hour long breaks inbetween all of my classes, and i guess i should use that time to study, maybe outside the student union or the fac building. we had a gentleman from the learning center come by the fraternity house and scare me by speaking about high school students whom have come to the university with straight a's and left with d's because they did not know how to study, for this i am a prime candidate. i never studied in high school save for calculus. at least i will not have trouble with writing papers, as i am quite affluent with the subject. i write a lot in my english class, which is taught by a disorganized hippie. he is a nice man but is very difficult to gauge. this professor also has a very ludicrous way of assessing grades; he uses something called the online learning record. i have yet to figure the whole thing out but it seems to me, that it is a totally fallacious way of determining a student's progress through his own introspection. i guess i am a product of conventional thinking and teaching; maybe the class will be good for me. i feel, at least overall, that my classes are very well taught with the one exception. i have, however, heard that my psychology professor gives very difficult tests, but i am a very good test taker, we'll see. my only real concern so far is time management and maintaining a decent level of sleep, which i have yet to achieve so far. i guess i need to skip a few social events and get some rest, though i have met a very nice girl already whom i like very much; i recently asked her to o. u. weekend and she politely accepted. hopefully, our relationship will not crumble between now and the time of the game. there is another girl who i feel bad about not asking, though i imagine that she will find another date. we where seeing each other quite a bit before i met the other, though i am sure she does not care as much as i am probably pretending she is. i guess that this is enough, and would like to close by stating that the first two weeks have absolutely flown by, and i am hopeful that my grades will remain high throughout the semester.

"i'm really unsure about this assignment because i'm afraid i won't be able to think of things to say for 20 minutes so i'll start off with why i'm so mad right now. last night allison, rebecca, and stephanie and i went with paul and trey to go coon hunting because allison and i went with them last weekend and it was fun, so anyway we drove for an hour to get to killeen over this bridge that they hang prostitutes from no that was later first we went to this house that was so trashy that rebecca didn't even want to go inside to use the bathroom so she went outside that's gross then we drove to the place for hunting and they made us get in the bed of the truck and trey drove about 50 mph and we were flying all around we played this i've never game i didn't realize that rebecca and stephanie are just like me that's cool so then we go over this bridge that smells like shit or rotting carcasses or something and we were so scared because stephanie was telling a ghost story abo9ut a bridge and then trey turned around and we went over the bridge about 3 more times we were so scared then we get to the field and paul was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out allison had begun paul had jodi and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and i refused to go any further and paul screamed at me that i was a bitch and he didn't give a fuck what i did so i went back through the woods with no flashlight so i could get in the truck i have never been more scarred in my entire life i prayed the whole time and i took spice out because i was afraid that i was going to get raped and murdered or something i was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that i loved them and that i would miss them because i was going to die then i heard a voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure i was okay i was so happy then about 30 minutes later the others came back, they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they'd stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time paul is bitching to allison about everything and treating her like shit i think she could do so much better but she's in love and i told her that but we didn't get home until 4am and i had a 10 class that i've missed too much already but i made it and that has basically what has been consuming me today i'm sorry if its not what you wanted.

so twenty minutes? i'll probably finish at 12:40 and then oh that guy is wearing a blue god its hot she has really black hair and this room is really hot it's funny how i keep repeating the same thing over again i don't know what to right lakamini was in chemistry class today i feel bloated and stupid for writing that on my assignment monday i am going to have to go to cardio and weight training and i don't want too my hands are getting sweaty and i'm not sure if that's how you spell sweaty but this gum is really getting hard and i feel bad for chewing so much gum gosh i can't believe it took me like four times to spell out gum i wonder how many minutes i have left i don't want to look up at the time because then the time will go by slower so i really need to practice more on my typing i make to many mistakes and then it makes me frustrated see i wonder what my mom and eric and dad and chito are doing i think my mom is going to make chito some pasta which eric really likes and i forgot to capitalize is that how you spell capitalize well i forgot to capitalize the other names i'll just do it when i am finished if i can because i don't know if the computer is just going to shut off should i keep pressing the cap lock key when i don't even need it maybe i'll go by wendy's and get a salad but this gum reminds me of mexico it's only been seven minutes and why did i capitalize the i in its should i put a comma the person reading this is going to think i am stupid why did i do that why did i need to stop making so many mistakes my legs are so sore and the my vision is starting to blur kind of probably because i was in the sun then i came inside why am i putting periods at the end of a word it's not like it i'm tired after this i will email meghan oh who cares if i don't capitalize her name yeah only nine more minutes to go good because my arms or whatever they are called are starting to stick to the i can see my nose my arms are so sore from all those push ups these chairs are really comfortable that guy looks like some guy from san antonio i wish i had clear skin again without holes but i keep going to the stupid doctor and they all tell me the same thing and i am so tired i just wish somebody i keep uncapitalizing the i how do i put little commas around the i oh well i only have five more minutes but so many girls here have i should sit up this computer is really nice i could put it in my room i don't think i am going to wow our brains do do a lot of thinking that's probably why my head hurt sometimes from all the thinking or probably i am wrong three more minutes that ola organization was good but i felt like i was in the youth group because all they did was talk spanish daniel is going to get mad at me because i didn't call him after class we'll probably go watch cabin fever it is supposed to come out today i wonder if it will be good my finger s are all jumping around the wrist is hurting from all the one more minute to type i don't god i can't type i haven't typed what did i just do my toe itches but should i keep typing for more i guess it would look good or maybe not because whoever is going to read these i am sure doesn't want them to be that long that way i wonder how much longer i have been typing for probably only one minute but i am going to stop now because i have to go to class in about fifteen minutes. ,1
" consious stream of thinking huh. i don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. these chicken taquitos sure are good. a lot of greese though. ya know, i really like musicals, but only ones from andrew loyd webber and ones from the late 19th century like gilbert and sullivan. speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. topsey turvey that is. i wish there had been more in there from the pirates of p. but it was still pretty good. i can't believe that i have a lecture to go to at 5 to 6:30. at least is isn't on friday. that would really suck. i should download some songs from the beatles. in fact, i should buy the yellow submarine on dvd. that would be a good movie to have. i wonder what movie i should go see this weekend. i haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. i wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. i'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. oh well. i need to write kim an e-mail. i haven't see her or kate in a really long time. they would probably appreciate that. i'll do that tonight after i finish reading the iliad. i need to read the rupublic. i meant to a year or two ago, but i never got around to it. i didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now i'm really getting into it. i don't know if i really want to bother learning guitar or not. i know it is never something that i would seriously persue, but still. at least i've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. i might as well, i see to have plenty of time on my hands. except for in the mornings. the past two mornings i've set my alarm early so i could wake up and get some reading done for class. too bad that both mornings i've overslept and yesterday i was late to physics. not that it really mattered. i could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. it's easier than what i took in high-school. my mom called me the other day. i was at starbucks, so i didn't really talk very long. i'll have to call her back tonight when i get in. i'm sure that they miss me. it doesn't feel all that different then when i was at home. i guess i might be homesick if i was going to school in like vermont or something like sara is, but i'm 3 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. i guess it helps also that i stay busy. i also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. i really want to go buy a phantom of the opera cd today. i'll see if they have it at barnes and noble although it will be an outrageous price. sarah brightman is a really good singer. it really helped that she was married to webber. that must have been a big career booster. it really doesn't see like i've written all that much. there is a lot more goig on in my head, but i just can't get it all out. some of the musicals that i really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. they just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made.

"i think that the only reason college is as hard as everyone says it is is because they do not want to look dumb in front of other people. i came here thinking that i was in for it but all my classes seem not too difficult with a little bit of reading and work, but then again when people ask me how it is i can pretty much, no clearly see myself saying it is really hard you are in for it. i hate how, no i like the fact that my brother knows a million people no really by a million i mean a million but a cannot stand the fact that when i meet them for some reason after i am introduced by my name and then a relation of his people do this kind of weird double take and say oh you are his sister as if they have or had heard many of incidents and or events involving me it makes me a little uncomfortable more so with the males than the females though sometimes i think that the whole world does in fact revolve around the way people look (although when asked the whole world denies it) as if they do not judge or insinuate on the appearance of others i wonder what people think of me i have been told many of times that i fit the idealistic look of that of a rich snob, almost brat like appearance which is then reversed though my personality i would have never thought people would think of stuff like that about me i am highly, no i would say extremely satisfied with myself appearance, social class, and moralistic views though in the least conceited manner possible i do not understand sometimes the way males think though especially after a few or more drinks i cannot wait until i can buy my elephant a real live circus if you will in my own back yard i am starting to think though that i might have to settle for an elephant shaped pool instead i have never really believed in love at first sight or that someone was """"made"""" or """"meant to be"""" for you you just find someone you can make it work with otherwise why do so many people get divorced and remarried multiple times before or ever finding the right person it irritates me that people think that you are interested in them in a relationship type of manner when you simply look at them, i look at everybody if the door opens i turn around and see who walked in i highly dislike immature people and seem not to understand why certain people are the way that they are i mean i know experiences and relationships have shaped their past but i have many faults in my past and have dealt with or lived with the one person i actually can say i hate i am the least bit negative though and am equally open to everyone that is introduced to my knowledge i like being open minded it enables people as well as myself to look at views and people in an entirely almost inhuman perspective i recently also noticed that nothing really stresses me out or makes me scared or nervous i never stress out why bother stressing about it which also wastes valuable time when the time can be using in a calm cool manner completing the task i just as similarly cannot think of anything that makes me nervous or scared i do not have a problem talking to extremely large audiences nor am i afraid of death i do not understand why people pass out bibles on campus either although i am not christian i went to a catholic school which helped me learn to respect other religions as well as traditions and practices so i cannot throw the bible away and i do not want to leave it anywhere because it is the word of someone else's supreme being ",0
"well, i'm sitting here at my computer on my desk thinking about what to write gosh i cannot spell right now this is really frustrating. it's different when you type this kind of assignment because when you write things on paper, you don't have to worry about misspelling anything because you are writing and when you type, sometimes your fingers don't type the right keys and everything gets all messed up. well i'm going to see my boyfriend in about a week and a half my hands and fingers are getting tired of typing and his picture is right here on top of my desk. he is so wonderful. i wish we weren't at different colleges. it would be so much easier if we were in the same city so we could see each other more often, it's only been 3 minutes since i've been doing this and i have 17 more minutes this is going to be a really long assignment. it seemed easy when i heard about it, but it really isn't that easy. my fingers really hurt and i wish i could just write this out, but i guess you have to have it in email format. well i'm really anxious to see my boyfriend. every time i think about him i get a really big smile on my face. i told him that even when i talk to people, sometimes i'll just smile in the middle of what i am saying because i'm thinking about him. he's in houston, going to rice. i was really interested in rice a couple of years ago because my cousin, who's 4 years older than me, went there and he really liked it there. anyway, i've been trying to book a bus ride over there, but it's pretty hard to do that, especially when i'm trying to juggle my tine between trying to book the ride and going to class and everything like that. but hopefully it'll all work out ok. it's going to be really fun because i haven't seen him since he left for houston on august 20th. it's been so long since i've seen him. we talk on the phone occasionally, but that gets really expensive really quickly and so most of the time we just email each other and i'm each other. but his schedule is so different from mine and its hard to talk especially when i need to study but i really want to talk to him. it's so hard. ands all this studying is getting me tired. it's only the 4th day of class and already i feel burned out from all the reading and everything ok i think it's been about 11 minutes, uh oh i stopped writing because i lost track of how long i have been writing but now i know so that's' good. gosh my fingers hurt. i've never typed this much before with out taking a break. aye ok, i need to get my wrist pad because they hurt. all right, that's better. now, back to jake that's his name. he's supposed to get online again at midnight and i really hope he does. he's been going to bed really early lately and it sucks because then i can't talk to him as much as we normally talk. i love him so much. it hurts inside to think of him and i really want to be with him right now. but i don't want to talk about that to you because it's my problem, that's why i'm going to see him next friday. i'm so excited to see him. he's seriously the best thing to happen to me for a really long time. we've gone out before, actually my freshman year of high school we were dating and we've been going out off and on since then. i seriously think we were made for each other. he is so sweet and he's really in touch with his sensitive side, and that really turns me on in a guy. i like it when guys cry too. i mean, not too much, because then it seems like they're too sensitive, but if he cries a little, it means he's sensitive and that totally turns me on. anyway, i'm probably leaving next thursday so that i can spend the night with my other friend, pam, who also goes to rice. i'm going to go to a party on friday night with her and jake and then i'll spend the next two nights with jake (but we aren't going to do anything) that's another thing i really admire about him is that we both have the same morals and expectations and he is really sensitive to my feelings and wants. he has got to be the best thing going for me right now besides of course being at ut. that is really awesome too. anyway, i'm running about of things to say, oops that didn't make much sense, but i'm almost done hooray! anyway, i'm staring at my really bright yellow hilighter right now and it hurts my eyes. i need to go pick up my football tickets tomorrow after my philosophy class because i'm in the draw. i wonder how i can get 8 tickets besides mine that makes a total of 9 tickets. my whole family is coming up to austin for the houston game on the 23rd because my birthday is the 24th and we are celebrating it that saturday. well, it's been about 20 minutes so i guess my first official psychology writing assignment is done. that makes me feel good. well, bye!

"today i skipped class for some reason. i don't know why i do these things. i know it is bad and i have nothing better to do, yet continuously i do this. what am i going to do with this major i have selected?. i don't even know if i what to stay in school. i want to work on my boat, and that is all. i need to finish the floors, fiberglass them. add the carpet, insulate the cooler. do all the engine work, hopefully the thing will run without incident. i need to buy coil wire, gas, carpet, foam padding, more fiberglass resin, collector gaskets, i already have the spark plugs. i hope nothing goes wrong because i accidentally hit the tab button and the web page backed up on me. if so when it happened i was five minutes into writing the paper. this keyboard is vastly uncomfortable and the next twelve minutes are going to suck. i am now typing with just one finger. i want roy to bring his boat out this weekend. we could use my truck to put it in the water so i can look cool. that is of course if i fix the bastard. i wonder if someone reads this. what if i were to type a bunch of curse words. how would my grade change. too bad i won't try this because my gpa sucks as it is right now, therefore i must be as courteous as possible. my hand now hurts extremely bad and i still have seven more minutes. now i stood up to see if it helps my hands. it seems to work as long as i use the one finger method. i keep hitting the wrong buttons. i wonder if i could sue the professor for damage to my hands due to this project? too bad the professor does not make jack for pay. i need to find a rich bastard to sue so i no longer have to attend school. if someone reads this i wonder if they think i am as sick as i really am. in case of technical difficulties my name is steve gernon. not that a ta would have the brains, oops sorry about that. at this point there is one minute and i cannot wait. it's the best moment of my life. i can now leave this god awful position and get on with my life.

"i am very disappointed. its been raining all day and i'm tired. i didn't sleep last night, that isn't any good. i can't stand not sleeping. sometimes i think that maybe i'm just not good enough for college, or at least ut. things have been hectic the whole time i have been on campus, and if i don't do good this semester, i'm going to fail out. i hope that i can pull this all off. the weekend was nice though, partying with all of my fraternity brothers was a good time, and seeing all of my old high school baseball buddies was cool too. i need to do stuff like that more often. i hope that things can get back to the way they used to be, since i liked everything much much more back then, when my whole life was a hell of a lot simpler. i miss high school, sadly enough. i liked school a lot better when it was just me and 1500 other people. i knew everyone, everyone knew me. life was good. i can't stand this 50k of people on campus around, it drives me crazy. i'm lucky to see a friend walking around campus, let alone a lot of them. oh well, i hope that life gets better soon. this weekend should be a lot of fun. oh, my pizza is ready, its been 18 minutes since i sat down. i spend a lot of time thinking and then trying to transfer things to words. same old problem for me. i can think great, but when it comes to putting things to words, i suck.

"this is my first writing assignment. i'm watching cosby on tv. i have a headache. i've had a headache most of today. i woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep. i had a stomach ache and felt like i was going to be sick. i had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so i got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good i think for breakfast. i think from now on on mwf i'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. i was supposed to have a study group tonight but i called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but i don't really need it. i think i'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. i had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the ap test so i'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since i'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. i was thinking about switching majors to psych cause i really enjoyed everything i learned in high school when i took it. i don't know if i'll switch over though yet. i'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day i've felt like crap and i miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since i've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 2 1'2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. i'd come home every weekend if i had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. i'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. i don't care about the experience. i'm here to learn and i do that during the week. i do all my homework when i need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't i come home and spend my time with the one person i want to spend time with. well i know people here that have offered me rides so i can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause i spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on i'll get rides home from other people so i can spend my time with who i want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. i feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how i feel. i love my mom and everything, but i'm not really close to her at all, and i've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything. and i am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease. i'm so close to mariko and i love her so much and it's just hard being away from her. she goes to japan every summer with her family. i've been thinking about going next summer. i'd have to talk with her parents about that though. but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and i'd have to stay with mariko's family in japan otherwise i wouldn't be able to afford a hotel for a month. so that would cost me a ton of money, and then i've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also. i really want to go. my mom's really against the religion i've joined. she is just heard too many things that aren't true. and i hate how she feels. but through religion i've learned how to deal with all these feelings and i'm comforted now and i forgive my mom for how she feels because she just doesn't know any better. i'm kind of tired and i still have a headache. i want something to drink. the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time i checked, and right now i don't want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out. i don't' feel like a sprite either, i could go down to san jac again. i think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. i need to move around more or something i guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and i can't stand it. i put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and i put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so i guess i won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but i don't think it matters. oh well. i have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. i like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. i miss her so much. i hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. i don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases. i wish i could help her more but there's not much i can do. she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved. sometimes it just gets tough for her. and that's a whole other reason i want to be home still. so i can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down. we still talk online all the time and i call sometimes. it's hard to find times to call though. either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then i have classes at certain times so i can't just leave and call her. but i'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call. tomorrow's thursday already so i don't think i'll get a couple calls in this week. i'll call on the weekend though since i won't be going home this weekend. hopefully i meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute. i seem to be the youngest person there. and i'm already not a talkative person, so i think it's going to be kinda hard to meet people. oh well. 10 seconds left for this thing. hopefully the rest of the year goes well.

my thoughts. as i sit here thinking my mind wonders into so many different plains of emotion and depth. i like the music i am listening to but my concentration is probably dying. i hate typing. this is a great way to see how i am thinking although i am tired and my thoughts are probably greatly distorted. i am glad i came to college station last night. it feels good to be back here and to see all these people i know already. i am already tired of seeing people it is almost impossible to get to know. my roommate is probably sitting at my apartment all alone and that is too bad i wish she had something to do as well. i like her but we do have some crazy differences. i am extremely thirsty. it is very hot in here. the past few days have been so terribly hot outside. i like the fall and the winter better. everything is a lot more enjoyable then. i cant wait to see my old friends when i go home during christmas. in high school i always thought i was different from everyone else and to an extent i was. i hate yellow. i like to write but i would rather be reading a good book right now or maybe going to play put-put golf. twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. charlie has gone to work and i don't have much to do now other than this. why do people act so stupid today. i am scared to meet people because they all seem so strange and their thoughts all seem to be the opposite of mine. i want to breathe a breath that is new. i see nothing as far as my life is right now. i live my life with the shadows and i know that this is wrong or is it . i will find a place i have before. my head hurts what else can i write oh sweet brain. i love psychology it is so exciting and new and apparent . i am going to enjoy this class even though is has about a billion people in it and that is a change since my town only has 1400 people living in it . all so big big big i feel like i have been bent and thrown around right now i need to get some more sleep but i cant do that right now i am falling into this trap of thinking about my thoughts and my thoughts are typical and dull to me but i am not typical and dull why are my thoughts coming out this way on paper. maybe it has something to do with trying too hard or subconsciously knowing complete strangers are going to read this (i like to write my thoughts for myself. sorry 20 minutes is up . ,1
"i'm not sure since i've just started college and haven't had any tests yet. i need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now i'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will i ever get some sleep. not if i have to keep typing this damn assignment. but who needs sleep anyway i wondering if i have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am i to judge people for being nasty. my girlfriend just said that i'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. i need to be working so i can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that i have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which i'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because i don't have enough time to study since i have to work to. oh i'm wondering if they are going to open the ut tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. i don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. it has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. but live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. my significant other is wondering what i'm typing right now, so i am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that i just typed about 15 minutes ago. anyway, i'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so i have to go chase her so that i can return her safely to the ocean. alright then bye know because i've been typing for twenty minutes and i need to go smoke a cigarette.

"20 minutes. that's a long time. i'm not sure if i have enought thoughts to fill 20 minutes. that's a lot of seconds too. 20 x 60 = 12000 seconds, i think. unless i put one too many zero's and then i suppose it wouldn't be too bad. luckily, i have a timer for the kitchen that my grandmother just sent me for my birthday that i can use to keep track of this writing assignment. i'm also listening to some tunes as i write this. i don't know if that is allowed, but i think i would get too bored if i didn't get to listen to music. i love listening to music very much. and i love belle and sebastian very much which is what i happen to be listening too now. unfortunately, i can not sing nor do i have the ability to play any musical instruments. what a sad sad state of affairs. i am also drinking some orange soda as i write this. mmmmm, orange soda. i just baked a pineapple upside down cake and i think that i just might have turned out well. as well as a pineapple upside down cake can be i suppose. later tonight i think i am going to visit my strange friend kurt and his roommate adam. they are having a little gathering there. it's a good thing i don't have school tomorrow. esp. since i have tons of work to do and i haven't done any of it yet. i have gotten far behind these first couple of weeks. some of it is because of the recent move but that's just an excuse for the most part. i'd just rather be doing other things than homework lots of the time. i really need to figure out what i'm going to do with the rest of my life. i don't want to work just yet, so that means more school. i am positive that law school is notthe place for me to be. maybe public policy, but even that i'm not all that sure of. maybe someone will offer me a job where all i do is sit around all day playing jezzball, looking cute. maybe they'll pay me lots of money for that. wouldn't that be nice. i'm sure that i wouldnt' be the only applicatant for a job that sweet. i also need to figure out what on earth i'm going to do for my junior fellows project. dean carver is going to freak out if i don't come up with something soon. i'm such a slacker, i don't' know why they keep letting me do stuff at this university. i worry for jessica and her three hours of school this semester. i don't think that's such a good idea. how easy will it be for her to justify dropping that one class? far too. i don't know what she thinks she's going to do with the rest of her life. run off with michael wherever he decides to go in may? that will hardly work for anyone. yikes. they just got back from some kind of party and they were way overdressed. that is pretty funny. i don't' know why they didn't just suck it up. but i guess that would have made them look kind of stupid. i think that this is an interesting turn of events. i also hope that someone doesn't read over my shoulder because i might get in just a little trouble for typing some of the things that i am saying. jessica is complainging about being fat. let me just take this time to mention taht it is fine time for me to get out and exercise or something like that. i guess i won't ever be as thin as i was when i was 16, but it's hard to face that fact. well, they left again, so it's just me and the orange soda and belle aand sebastian again. that's more like i like it. althought michael hasn't benn over here as much since jessica is pissed at him more often these days. it's kind of nice to have him out of my hair. i am suprised that mindy has not yet called today. she is so nuts, i don't even know what to do with her. i am afraid that she might tell catherine some of the things that we've said to her recently since she's so pipolar and loving of catherine two days after she tells her that they're not going to live together next year or buy groceries together. what a nut case. they're all nuts i tell you. not me exculded, just eeeveryone that i know. where are all the sane people in this world? are they hiding out at home afraid to come out because all of us wacko's are walking around outside? wouldn't that be a funny sight to behold. i hope that i can find someone to teach me to play go. i don't want to have this board just sitting around the house with nothing to do with it. talk about impluse buys. i guess there are worse things to spend money on, but i can't think of what that would be right now. mmm. i want to smoke. this 20 minutes is killing me. so i smoking i suppose, but since i'm not all that excited about living until i'm 80, it's okay that i'm taking seven minutes off my life or whatever that urban legend is. i need to take a shower soon, if i think i'm going out to any kind of party. with this short short hair and all this gunk that i've been putting in it, it is imperative that i wash it soon. it's looking pretty greasy. i'm not sure about this short hair just yet. jacob says that it looks sophisticated, but i think it just looks short. i've never ever had my hair this short. it grows back i guess. i do kind of like the fact that i don't have to do anything with it and that it's not in my way in the slightest bit. that's what i get for letting philip choose what to do with it. that's also what i get for being so indecisive. i'm also worried that these bangs things are going to acause my forhead to break out because they sitting there all teh time. oohhh, the timer just rang and it scared the living bageezers out of me.

"this week is the most religious week in my religion. i haven't been fasting like i should be. it's gets kind of difficult being in school and all . but maybe i should try harder. i mean, aren't i supposed to be responsible enough to handle things on my own. my parents sent me off to college hoping i can learn to be more responsible and independent. maybe i'll try to fast tomorrow. actually, i have been kind of bad lately. i have been eating things i should not be. and i have also been eating after dark. i wonder . how much am i going to pay for this later? i mean in terms of sins and punishments. i am, basically, a decent human being. many other people think so. but then again, it matters what i think and if i think i am a descent person. well am i. or not?  i am . but i could be a lot better. -guess everybody can. but oh well . why do i stress about little things so much? maybe i get it from dad. he always gets uptight over little things. man, come to think of it, i act like dad a lot. i mean i get aggravated at little things, i have, more or less, the same morals and practices. i gotta stop stressing so much or i am not gonna be able to handle college too well. it seems like i try to seem calm and collected in presence of other people, but in reality i'm stressed. i seem to have a lack of self confidence. but at times, i feel more confident about myself than ever. is that uncommon? i dunno. my lack of self confidence really does bother me. and it affects the way i am perceived by my peers. some people, like my friend *******, i mean you can just tell by the way he talks and carries himself, that is extremely confident and secure about himself. i want to be like that but i also need to be who i am, you know? i go through phases of feeling high and low self esteem. i think my brother has a lot of effect on me. it seems like i'm always feeling less confident about myself when i am around him. he has a great way of bringing out the worst in me and making me feel like crap. he does well too. butt he only does it to his family. isn't that weird? to everybody else he is a terrific guy. but little do they know that he treats his loved ones the worst. or so it feels like it. but i never have the guts to stand up to him. why don't i. it's because i'm not confident of who am and what i stand for and what i want to be. and <----- that really, i mean really bothers me. and until i figure all that out, ill continue to feel just i am feeling now, maybe worse. my brother is always in the back of my mind. if i buy a shirt, will he get mad that it costs too much, or i already had one like it, or i don't need another one. i hate him being on my shoulder in every thing i do. how can i get him out of my head. some time i wish he wasn't so smart and intelligent. then maybe he'd respect me for my own person, not the way he is or the way he wants me to be, maybe like an equal, maybe like a brother, and not a puppet. man i got some problems with myself. but i guess everyone does, right? what make mine so much more important than others? at least i have my health, great family, money, an education, shelter, food. where am i inside myself. i must know. i'm dying to find out so i can get on with my life - with some meaning and reason. i feel chaos .

" currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. today is my 9 month anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. she is the best thing that ever happened to my life. i want to by her a ring and i have been giving it plenty of thought. i have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. i thought about my grandmother, who is affected my alzheimer's. i felt gult come over me when i thought of all the times i yelled at her. i live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. i generally understand that i am not truely mad at my grandmother when i yell at her. i am mad at the disease. i don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. i got addmitted to the business school thats the reason i am here. and i have been thinking that i have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that i am living. i worked harder than most and i played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my senior class. but again i feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. what should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words i could say, i'm in the business school. people look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which i can officailly say bothers me. i love my mom. . she called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. she is so worried about me. oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind i have. my roomie says that i complain alot. . do i. my girlfriend has said the same but i disagree with them both. i just want to be the best at everything and i have to win or im not happy. just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. god made me competitive and thats the way i live. back to that business thing. . i worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. see my parents had a divorce my junior year of high school. thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. my dad left us and i can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. besides that i'm in love and i have the best girl i could ever dream of. her mom says we can't be together but all through our senior year we stayed together. sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. not loyalty and all the universal answers to what makes a best friend. she sacraficed her family to be with me. her mom said, either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him. she chose me in an instant. . for a long time i woundered why. . and to this day the only answer i could find is love. true love is what we share and today is 9 months. love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. my grandfather had to raise me since i never had a father. that hurts me more than the world could ever know. oh another thought came to me. i am suffering from sexual frustration. i'm not sure if i can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right? well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1'2. seems like forever but we will be fine. we pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. i nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. if i complain too much sorry. thats just me right?

"what is love of an emotional basis? how do you know you are in love? is there a boundary to love? are there limits? many people ask these questions, including myself, but cannot find an answer to these questions. i believe that this can only be found out by experience, where you test these limits and grow by it. i have noticed in my personal life that i grow emotionally and mentally each time i find a new partner. love must be a learning experience right? it seems to be that way. i was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school, were i felt as if i was in love with this girl. we took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have. but this form of love seemed to build so quickly. as i looked back at the letters we wrote each other, it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two. how cold that be? does love come at once, or does it grow on you? nine months later, we ended our relationship. it seemed to be the most painful event i had experienced. i next felt like i loved a girl i barely knew. we dated, but nothing came of this, however the crummy feeling you feel after a relationship is over lasted almost a half year. how could someone i just dated for a span of a month create such an effect on me? by my senior year, sometime in january, i became interested in another girl. by this time i had felt that i had grew and i would be able to make this girl happy, and would not make he same mistakes i did with the last girls. as time passed my love grew for this girl, something i had not felt in so long and so strongly. eventually (1 year and 1 month) things deteriorated. how could i have let this love slip? i thought i had mastered the relationship sector of my life. during the summer i met a new girl, whom i am currently with. i don't want to make the same mistake i have before but is it inevitable. will this relationship be like the others, or will i love her stronger than the other girl?

"i miss my guitar. i wish that i had brought one of them with me. i have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. that kind of sucks though, that i let mom borrow the one i really want to bring with me. i am glad though that she taking lessons. maybe i could teach her some metallica. i hope she helps erin pay for that car she wants. but erin also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. oh well, i'm glad erin is getting that car, bmw's are real safe. i should know, i've totaled enough of them. that scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and i've already lost a cousin, i don't know what i would do if i lost my sister. at least they're safe cars. i hope i can get a car for christmas. i know i totaled a bunch of cars, but i was also an addict when i was in all of those wrecks, and i'm better now, it could be a reward. my doctor is really proud of me. when i told him that i had been clean for 101 days, he was very proud and said that """"a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult.

"i am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. i can't really smell anything because i'm getting over a cold. i'm thinking about last night. my sorority had a party at antone's and my date just didn't show up. i've been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. either way he owes me big time. now i'm listening to the doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. i trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. i have a class today that i have to read for before 2 o'clock. i really don't feel like reading for that class, but i guess i have to. it's biology and i like the class, but i just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which i am not to excited about. my foot is starting to hurt because i was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. i hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up i guess you would call it. this cd that i'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. it's not my cd or i would know what is on it. i wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. i mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. it's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. i have a download capability on my computer but i don't use it all that often, so i doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. i understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the cd. i have no idea who this song playing is by. i still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, i really need to try and wash them off before i forget about it and go to class with them still on. i don't like the way they write exes on your hands. is not one hand enough? they really don't need to mark both of them. i don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. there would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as i was expecting it to be. well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. i'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so i'm more excited about that. he is not coming in until much later though, i wish he could come earlier. i also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for lion hunt, another thing that the sorority throws. life is so hectic at college, i don't ahve time to really do anything. i don't know how some people do it. they can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. if i'm behind in a class it bothers me until i get it done. then after i sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. all i did yesterday afternoon was read. i'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. but then next week, the cycle starts all over again. i guess that's why i feel like i'm never caught up completely. we're listening to school's out for summer"""", i wish it was! but that won't happen for a very very long time. but i had fun this summer. i didn't have a job, so i got to do whatever i wanted. it was fun. i really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. they're all clean but thrown around from when i was trying to figure out what to wear last night. i need to go to the grocery store too, i'm out of bottled water and drinks. i need to get more hangers too. ok enough of this random writing, my 20 minutes are up.

"this is going to be a cool assignment. we just get to talk about what is going on right now in our lives. i think college is going to be really awesome. we are going to learn so much from all the different types of classes we are taking. i am very tired from classes today. it is tiring to walk all around campus. i will not take the loop cause i don't want to be lost or anything. i think that would be scary to get lost on the loop. my roommate just left to the coop. she has to return all these books. my computer is pretty slow and i hope it doesn't break down while i am typing this. i think that jester is pretty nice. i am glad that my suitemates are really cool. they take me places cause they have cars. one is from katy, and my other suitemate is from austin. my really good friend is sleeping, because she is waiting for me to eat. we are going to go eat at jester probably. it should be interesting cause i really don't like to eat jester food that much. it was alright at lunch, but i think it is going to be pretty gross tonight. people stare in the windows at jester. it is weird to think that there are people out there that could be looking at you. it is really has a pretty courtyard though. i am so tired. i don't think i have much homework to do tonight though. it should be interesting, because i have to write a paper for english. i really don't know what i should write it about though. i have no idea. gregory is a really cool place. you get to run and workout. i like to play volleyball. that has been lots of fun being able to play at night. ut has really cool places to see around it too. i think i have eaten out so much. people here are so different. i think that is really cool though cause if they weren't, this place would be really boring and stuff. the computer is sometimes a waste of time. i know so many people that just sit and chat on the computer for hours. i think it is really fun too, but you don't need to stay on it for a couple of days. people think that college is really easy and therefore don't have to study. i think they are going to get a rude awakening sometime. my suitemate is trying to work her computer. it is pretty funny cause she doesn't really know how to work it. my sisters just sent me a care package. it was really cool. it had like some soap, and candy. it also had like pictures and stuff. i have to move out soon cause of the pipes are being installed. well, my friend says to write about the future. i don't know about the future. it should be pretty interesting i hope. i think that i will have to study a lot this year. my sister is going to try to help me out though hopefully. she is going to have it hard. i am going to play i'm sports. i hopefully will be able to handle everything cause i know it is really going to be hard and stuff. i eat too much. i am pretty full and all, and we are going to go eat soon. i only have a couple more minutes so i will talk about how my computer is not working. for some reason when i got home it was broken. my friend tried to fix it. i think it will be alright. my favorite tennis player won the us open yesterday. it was pretty cool. he is really cool. he is from russia. i am tired once again. i just want to finish this. i have taken psychology before so i hopefully will be able to help my friends also that are in my class. all the people from where i am from all hang out with each other. it is pretty funny. i think that everyone should meet new people. my friends tried out for the mtv show. i don't know if they made it though. my time is up. i am very happy.

"i have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. my room mate is always playing spades on the internet. i type very loudly. my subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way i have it set up on my desk. this is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. the combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. it is like the drone of a prop-plane. my computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little """"engine"""" noises while i am typing. my room mate has a very odd way of typing. as i am doing this assignment, i am hearing myself talk the words as i type. i am sure that i have always done this, however, until now i have not noticed it. i believe that i just heard thunder. we could use the rain. i can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. i have a knot in my stomach. i know that i did poorly on it. i have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. my monitor also makes a noise that sounds like i would imagine electical energy to sound. i want to go home this weekend. i miss my brother. i am going to bring him to austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of ut. what time is it? i wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet? i wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here? i would like to retreat to lake tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the sierra nevadas. that was a very random thought. all of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. if my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. i have never had a class quite like psychology 301. i like the fact that it is web based. if i happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. and even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. i wish that i would have attended the first study session. i wish that i hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. that is such a strange idiom. i wonder how it came about. i wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. i have a very nice printer. it's fast, silent, and very clean looking. i am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his deskjet! i had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. it has turned out to be my hardest class. i do not think that i am going to take any more spanish after this semester. i don't think that i was truly prepared to take spn312k, but i must have guessed well on the wisconson test. i hope that my friend cory does well at rutgers this weekend. i can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. it seems like just the other day when we were playing together for cunningham middle school. now the guy is 6'5"""", 245lbs. ! i really enjoy football and i miss the contact, but my i'm experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. i really want to lift weights tonight, but i don't believe that i will have time. i also want to train with daniel, but i don't know what he has planned for tonight either. it feels like i have been thinking for hours, but it has only been a few minutes. this definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. at least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. and even then, that won't compare because """"artificial"""" is in the name. i really hope that my timer goes off soon and i can stop writing. i think that it would be really cool if i could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. it would be like esp. that reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of esp in fifth grade gifted'talented class. it makes me feel good to say that i have been identified g't. that's very cocky sounding, but i don't believe that i have told anyone of my identification in years. i have a problem with cockyness. i had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion.

"just sitting here and i decided that this would be a good time to write my stream of consciousness. i'm usually tired and don't feel like doing anything, but tonight i have this extra kick of energy (maybe it's the lone star). i've got mtv in the background. i swear all i've been hearing about is the video music awards. well. they'll finally be coming to tv tomorrow night. we had a hall meeting tonight to talk about the fire sprinkler installation, but we didn't go. we decided to go to the one thursday night, because my roommate was talking to her boyfriend. i always just sit there and listen to her talk. i wish i could talk to my boyfriend! i haven't talked to him for so long. let's see. since friday night! i swear our relationship is so strange. we hardly ever get the chance to talk or see each other. i get mad at him during this time because i feel like he's not trying to put anything into the relationship, but the minute i start talking to him i forget about all those feelings. i'm just so happy to hear his voice that i don't care about anything else. he's supposed to be coming to austin this weekend. i bought him a ticket to the 101 xfest. i haven't even bee able to tell him that he has one because he's never home so that i can call him. oh well! i'm so excited that i get to see him soon. all of a sudden my thinking process stopped. i don't know what to write. this is how i usually feel when i get a writing assignment. my brain just freezes up. i put it off until l the very last minute. i absolutely dread having to take english next semester. i wish that i had tried a little harder on the ap english exam i took my junior year. i scored a 2 the minimum score you can get is a three to test out of it. i remember sitting in the biology lab room, it stunk like formaldehyde frogs. i have no idea why that's where we took our test. it took so long! on the last essay i wrote one sentence and then gave up. i wasn't thinking that scoring a good grade on this test would save from having to take english in college. blah! blah! blah! i can't stop yawning. my eyes are starting to hurt from this bright computer screen. ok it's 9:12. i can stop now.

"why do we even have computers if they are so slow and crappy and can't hold more than """"x"""" number of people at a time. time. and why can't i put chip smart out of business. they sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. we had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. i am pretty ticked off right at the moment. i don't feel like writing this assignment. i had to buy first aid 98 to get the new modem to work. it just started working after a long and horrid battle so i am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. i don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. i hope you really aren't reading this, because i am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. i can think of nothing else but the immense dislike i have for my computer. i should name it lucifer. let me tell you a little about myself. i just got married aug. 8. therefore i am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at bridge hollow here in austin. i miss my father. his birthday was 9-7 and i forgot!!!!!!! i felt like crying all day. i miss my mother too. her birthday is coming up in february. (2-5-51) i truly don't know my father's age. he is older than my mom i know. they divorced when i was 5. after that i guess i lost count. i was adopted here in austin at marywood. i was extremely lucky, because i got the best 2 parents in the whole world! i truly mean that. i love them. i also miss my brother. he is in the waco youth center right now doing much better. he wants to start working on his career now. he had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. he is 3 years younger than me and is learning disabled. he had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. this center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. well, as you can probably tell i love my family. more importantly i love god because he sent his son jesus to die for my sins and because i accept him, believe in him, and in return i have given him my life to use me for his glory. time is up.

"how do you know when you can really know what another person feels. how do i learn to trust what people say to me. it's hard for me to be in a relationship when i can't see that person everyday. i know that i am the kind of person that would never want to cause any pain, yet i see people who are in relationships for such wrong reasons. my friend was telling me that she is dating this guy yet already has plans on leaving him for something better. i don't understand why people can be so selfish to where they don't think of other peoples feelings. i am in a very intense relationship right now. i love my boyfriend with all my heart. having a long distance relationship is very hard to deal with when you are the type of person who needs that comfort of a companion. i know how i feel for him and i think i know what he feels for me to, yet in a world where people can be so deceitful, i find it still possible that i can be the one being used in a relationship. i guess you must do what your heart tells you to because love is a risk. i believe it is worth taking. when you love someone, you have this vulnerable feeling towards them. i don't want to walk blindly into a relationship, being overwhelmed by the feeling of love but i would want to see how the flow goes. i want to learn how to be a good companion. i hope someday to make a really good wife. i find it important to marry your best friend. i can't wait until i figure out what life has in store for me. i want to do so many things and right now i feel so limited. i just hope that no matter what happens with my relationship now i can keep a friendship. i believe that the first love of your life will never die, and true love lives in you forever. i can never imagine not loving him anymore. i don't want to be person that is dependent on someone else but i do think that it is good to have someone to run to when things do always go right. sometimes i feel like i don't know what to say when he runs to me with difficulties in his life. he always seems to know what to say to make me smile. when he told me about his cousin in the hospital and how he figured the funeral would be coming soon, i had no idea what to say. i didn't know what to tell him other than the only thing we can do is pray for him. i believe that that is all we have when we come to situations like that. i just wish i could talk to him and be able to be more comforting. i have to feel like i am bringing him a sense of comfort in this relationship. i love him so much and i don't want him to suffer any pain. it is just so hard not being able to physically be there for him because just the comfort of having someone at your side, can help you get through rough times. when i do see him i will hopefully know what to say when that moment comes. i find that ever chance that we do get to see each other i try to absorb the feeling of his presence. i try to remember his scent and the way his lips feel against mine. it's so hard to let go of him. i just want to try to treasure that moment so that it can get me through another week. i miss hearing his voice even though we talked just a day ago. so how do i do this going maybe four years of living in another city. my life right now is perfectly the way that i have always planned and dreamed, except for living away from him. i know that i am not in a place to compromise. i can't compromise my education. i have always dreamed of going to this university and now that i am here, i wouldn't dream of letting this go. yet my problem is that i don't know that i could ask him to give up what he is doing, because i love him and i know that he loves what he does. yes, it is possible that he could move to austin, considering there are jobs available to him, but i wouldn't want him to make that decision because of me. i would want him to have more than me to move. so we just seem to take it day by day, but i can't help but ask """"where are we going to be next semester, next year or after i graduate?"""" my question must wait until the time happens. i have to just learn to have patience and see where destiny takes me. i will become stronger through all of this. i hope to learn selfconfidence and to be more dependent. i know that i have many good things to bring out to people and someday i will know who the person is that deserves my love and affection. maybe i know it now but in time i will find out whether i am right or not ",0
"i am almost five hundred miles from home, and i don't know anyone here. i'm not sure that what i feel is loneliness because i'm constantly surrounded by people here at the dorm, but i just don't feel at home here yet. people here are very nice, and i know everyone else is in the same position as i am in, but i really feel that this place isn't for me. i really want to go home so i can be around the people i grew up with and feel at home with. i have many regrets about coming here away from all my friends and family, but then again, i realize that ut is a great school, and my educational background will be greatly benefited. i suppose it's worth the sacrifices in the long scheme of things. maybe it is better for me to be here away from everyone else, as it should help me become much more independent and learn how to function alone. i've already learned a lot in the week since i've been here, and i feel that i've grown up a lot. i've had to do everything for myself, and force myself to go out and meet new people. my trust issue has become worse here, however, because i used to trust almost everyone, and now, i'm not sure who to trust and who not to trust. i know that if i can just stick it out for a while that i'll grow to love this place because i love learning and new experiences, and i'm definitely going to get both of those things here at ut. i can always transfer back home next semester if i don't adjust here well. i love the people here because they all seem so friendly. i do feel that i'll eventually make many new friends and this place will seem like home. i cannot sleep or eat here yet. i think it's just the adjustment phase. i have nightmares when i try to sleep, so i've grown accustomed to very few hours of sleep each week. i have no appetite, and every time i try to eat, i get this very sick feeling. i'm seriously hoping both of these feelings will go away soon. maybe that is just due to being homesick and not being in a place where i feel comfortable yet. i want to go home for the long weekend, but i think that will make it much harder when i come back. i don't think i'll want to leave my home again to return here. maybe it's just the people i left behind that i miss, but i think mostly it's always knowing someone everywhere i go there that makes me feel comfortable back in my hometown. on top of these things, my ex-boyfriend calls often here, and that makes it very difficult. we're still best friends and tell each other everything. the only reason we're not together now is because of our different college choices, and talking to him makes me want to return home even more. we do plan to get back together as soon as we graduate, but that's a long time from now, and not seeing him often is going to be very hard for me. i've known him for 13 years and relied upon him for everything. i went out with someone else this past weekend, and i felt very bad for it. even though we're not together, i know that he's the one i want, and i wonder if it's wrong to even date other people if i know i still love him and always will. it's made me feel bad when i talk to him, and i even told him about it. he says it will all be ok, but i just don't know. i'm so confused. there isn't a simple answer to anything i try to do here, and everything i do seems to have some kind of drawback to it. maybe if i sink myself into my studies, i will not forget, but maybe set aside the hurt that i feel right now. i think i should give that a try, and maybe start a rigorous exercise program so that i will be more tired at night, which might make me get some more rest and increase my appetite a little bit. maybe i should try to get out of this building. it seems very cold and uninviting, and i think another place might be better for me. well, i know that with my faith in god that everything will work out for the best if i just put my complete effort into it. it's all for the best!

"college is a lot different that i thought it would be. things are not as simple as they use not be. individuals on campus tend to be greatly deceiving in appearance and motives. walking down jester i see about five people at once trying to get me to join their particular club or organization. man i don't know if i want to join a sorority or not, and if i do i'm not sure which one to join. there are so many different ones with unique styles. not to mention that i would feel bad if i don't at least go to the meetings. mainly because my sister co founded the delta in houston. but the one in austin is not the same in activities and purpose. the ones at ut are mainly all about parties. i need to find out what we are all doing tonight. if we go clubbing i need to find out who all is driving and how i am getting everywhere. i hate this about austin no one really has a car and it is so inconvenient to go out. of course unless you find a guy with a car. but i doubt that will happen any time soon more importantly i don't even want to find a guy right now. i need to deal with getting use to college life and then i need to just have fun i guess. i have so much more freedom here, there is no one to enforce strict curfew, or make you do anything. everyone at ut is on their own and self reliant and self dependent. although it might sound scary at first it is a rush to have so much space to grow. not only that but you meet people and they can impact your life in ways you would of never imagined, and that is what i love the most about this experience. i would contend that college life is definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity, and i am grateful to have the chance. i can't wait until college really starts and i get the hang of it all. when things are new it takes a while to get use to it but soon enough i hope i get the hang of it all. the atmosphere here unlike any other i have ever been in and i believe that is a good thing. change brings about bigger and better opportunities. not to mention that my parents are not here. the main reason that i even decided to go to the university of texas is to be away from home. i need to me away from the usual drama of living at home. the only thing here is that the penalty can be a lot more serious for things you get in trouble for. i hope we don't in too much trouble for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, on tuesday. man if they call my parents i will be in so much trouble it is not even funny. they are going to kill me and then make me go back to the university of houston which i swore i would never do.

"my first week here at ut, i went through rush. i was kind of pressured into it by family and friends, but i also wanted to meet people. after a week of being fake and smiling a whole lot, i was invited into a sorority. i'm not the type of girl that loves having a ton of girlfriends, doing hair and make up, and talking about boys. i personally like to keep most of my feelings to myself and doing my own hair (which includes washing it only). i'm not into curling irons or the right eyeliner. those things just really don't concern me. that is what i thought sorority girls were like. some of them are girly girls, but i found a few to click with. i'm still not really sure about the whole greek life thing, but i'm going to try it for a while. the part i really don't like is the whole politics of the whole thing. it is very harsh and costs a lot of money. but, like i said, i'm going to try it. nothing about college has really surprised me yet, and i haven't really been that homesick, which is a very good thing. i do miss my pets back home and my best friend, but the people here are all so nice and friendly that it makes it a lot easier. i am a little nervous about some of my classes but hopefully that will die down after the first test. i was thrilled when i realized my roommate was normal and the fact that we get along so well. right now i think i need to focus on getting more sleep and not getting sick. i know i have plenty of time to go out and have fun and i need to learn to study. my parents keep on stressing to me how important it is to go to class and i know that and i haven't missed a class yet and don't plan on it. i want to do well but have fun at the same time. i don't really know what else. the emmy's are on right now and i really want to watch them. i'm obsessed with tv and movies. i seriously think i watch a movie a day and i guess that is good because rtf is my major. i have a really cute picture of my best friend and i sitting on my desk right now and looking at it is making me want to call her, which i think i will do now.

this is one of the most interesting assignments i've had. frisbee tomorrow i'll be late. i'm homesick and a bad typer is that the right word oh well all my friends and family enjoying themselves without me (sigh) this getting used to college is a little more difficult than i imagined but i guess that i always have trouble starting something new my legs are tired i ran 4 miles and played frisbee when i started elementary school i cried and clung to my dad's leg ican't remember middle school funny how i can remember something farther away than something more recent maybe elementary was more traumatic. then high school i got really tiny because i think i had a nervous stomach i can hear the girl next to me' s headphones it must be a foreign language we have to do that in french i'm finally getting hungry i thought i never would i need to work out more it is kind of depressing to have once worked out on a team five days a week twice a day with a whole bunch of people now i have to make myself do stuff that is not as fun i go by myself to the gym and to swim at least i found frisbee except they're a little more advanced than me but the practices aren't a s strenuous and as frequent as my old swim practices my room mates sick puking all night i keep washing my hands and the door knob every thing she touches it makes me nervous when people are sick i don't want to catch it and get my life off schedule i mean heck it just got into some kind of routine then i'd go and get sick miss class miss practice and have to get the notes from someone and not fall to far behind that makes me nervous i used to get sick all the time when i swam every winter i would get some kind of 5- 7 day flu and it would usually mess everything up my training for the meets especially i was so frustrated sometime s i would try and convince myself i wasn't sick and i would just keep going as if nothing was wrong and then bam i couldn't do it any longer i would be so weak and tired i had just made it worse nothing like making a problem even worse only three minutes to go and i'm hungry i think i will have an apple they taste mmmm i like to eat fruit i had a boyfriend that pretty much didn't eat fruit or vegetable he liked mashed potatoes and gravy chicken fried steak and all that stuff is fine but you have to balance or your going to die to soon probably unless you have good genes people should take care of themselves ,1
"my thoughts and feelings at the moment reflect several important aspects of my life. perhaps, one of the most recurring thoughts has been my progress with my academic success. i am worried and concerned with maintaining an above average status as a student. one other concern of mine relates to my commitment toward studying and learning. i fear that i will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home. thus, most of the time i reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried. i feel in great anguish and perhaps, turmoil. i am also very concerned about the financial needs and requirements of college. often, i feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents. this, in turn, causes much sadness for me. although the social aspect of my life, at the moment, is not a significant matter, i still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that i left behind. i comprehend the fact that any transition in life accompanies great distress and agitation. however, i find myself more weary and temperamental than distressed or melancholy. at times, i feel as though i have not slept for days. i feel constantly fatigued. i have always realized that i worry to a great degree; and at times that my lifestyle has dramatically changed, this aspect of my personality has in turn worsened. i see myself literally concerned about every trivial matter in life. i worry a lot about my weight issues. lately, i have noticed a dramatic change in my eating habits. through the past year, i was able to lose a great amount of weight and maintain it. i was also able to control what i ate in addition to exercising a great deal. however, lately i have deviated from this habitual behavior. i have gained about 10 pounds. i feel greatly out of control. i do not even have the motivation to exercise. often, i wake up in the morning and find myself critically loathing every aspect of my appearance. at school, i often compare myself with other females and feel greatly embarrassed. my parents and my acquaintances have at times mentioned that i look better now that i am not so underweight. however, i do not perceive or comprehend their point of view. as a result, i promise myself almost every day to lose all the unnecessary weight that i have gained. i even plan a strict diet for the next weeks. however, i never follow through the plan. although this recurring thought is truly trivial in comparison with matters concerning my education, i still cannot rid myself of the compulsive need to restrict my diet and control my eating habit. i believe that there is great tension in my life at the moment. perhaps, this is true for a lot of students that have began their first year of college experience. regardless of my emotional well being at the time, i still seek hope and remedy in studying and experiencing all the knowledge that college has to offer. i am sure that if i put enough effort into my academic advancement i will easily succeed in future. nevertheless, i truly wish that i could annihilate the worries that accompany me day and night.

"sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. i'm pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. i'm doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. i can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. i'm not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. i don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. i can't do it. i wonder what they'll do. probably not much i'll have about three quarters of i so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the rotc unit is good that way i guess i wonder how late i have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter i guess but i want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so i plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. i need to but i doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. i think that's time i hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing.

"every class seems like it has so much extra work, i feel like i will never have any free time. other than the work though, i love college compared to high school. i love the freedom i have and even the new responsibilities. right now everything is still fun, i'm sure though that i will get sick of cooking, cleaning,ironing, and doing everything else by myself pretty soon. i already miss my parents a little and my little sister very much. i can't wait to see her. i feel really bad though, because i promised her that i would come home and see her in two weeks, but i don't think i am going to be able to see her for another week. my mom said she was so excited that i was coming home. she just started second grade and i wish i could have been there to see her. it really sucks that i have to leave her, i feel like we may not be as close anymore if i don't see her as much. she used to beg me every night to sleep in my bed with me and at the time it was kind of a pain, but i really miss it now. i also really miss my boyfriend who is also back in dallas. he came down last weekend, but i don't think i'll get to see him for another week either. he is really taking me going off to college really good. i figured he would be mad at me all the time for hanging out with other guys and stuff, but he has been really cool about it. at first he got really jealous, but we talked about it and now he is completly understanding. i really hope we make it through the year and mabey he can move down here next year! that would be perfect. ilive with my best friend so at least i have her here. i think it would be really hard to go to such a big place like ut and not know anybody. people do it all the time ,but i think that i would get really depressed if now one i knew and trusted was down here. i really love it down here. austin is a really awesome town, it has everything! it is really different from midlothian, which is where i come from. it is a small town 30 miles south of dallas. we only have about two stop lights and mabey three fast food places. i think its really great though that i am getting the chance to live in a really small town and a reall big town too.

"i am so tired. i cannot wait to go home tomorrow and sleep in my own bed. i really didn't think i would miss home that much, but apparently i do. seriously, i cannot wait to go in the car and drive back to kingwood. but it's not like i am homesick. well, actually i guess i am homesick, but it's not for my family. to be quite honest, everytime i talk to my mother, she annoys me. but what i do miss is my bed. not the house, because we don't' live in the house anymore. no, we have to move two months before i leave for college. what were my parents thinking??? obviously they weren't. but i do miss garden point. i really want to go back to my room. but, now i have no room. honestly, i do not consider my dorm room my room. thinking of, i definitely need to bring back some more stuff. pictures and frames - stuff like that. my room mate brought so much crap. it makes my side of the room look so bare. but at the same time, i did bring a lot of stuff. anyways, this weekend. my date with hal. i really don't want to go at all. i know that i completley led him on. i mean i could have told him that i was joking, but i didn't. i basically told him that i liked him. but harold pitman! - ugh! i still sound like i am totally in highschool. i know that in college you are supposed to throw away all your passt conceptions of people, but how can i do that about the guy who teased me for like 3 years. how many times can you say, """"but mr. blayney, i'm only eleven?"""" and think it to be funny. i swear in seventh grade i could have shot him and ryan ochoa. ryan ochoa is another boy, who i would never ever date. when he got to be such a heart throb in high school is beyond me. but then again, i never ever thought that i would have a crush on cyrus. i am such a hypocrit. the amount of time i was telling gio, not to like him and not to go for him. but then again, gio and cyrus would not have lasted anyways. gio is so prude, cyrus would have either dumbed her or cheated on her pretty quickly. gosh, i really hope that this assginment is completion, or else you will think that i am a really shallow and superficial person. not to meniton judgemental. but actually what can you expect coming from kingwood high school - thrid snobbiest school in the nation??? i seriously had fun at high school, but it definitley was a different type of fun than the type of fun i'm having now. i mean in high school i hardly ever drank really, until my senior year. but even then it wasn't every weekend like i do now. i mean, we used to do stupid stuff like go to the airport and play airport tag, wrap or in the case of dawn """"condimenting"""" houses. but now, it's frat parties every weekend. not that i am complaining, because i am hanging out with brandon - what a hottie. but he is so rude. and kimberly - honestly, i havent' talked to her since 7th grade. it is so wierd how people who were so close are now so far appart. but anyways, maybe the frat parties and the drinking is what is making me so tired, because i am pretty sure that i had less sleep that i am having now in highschool. is this even stream of consciousness??? i ended up talkign about the same thing i began with, but i guess it is because i did go off on several tangents. but oh well - time's up!

what should i write about? i wish that i was not so slow at typing. i wonder how long i have typed for . man i haven't typed that long only 1 minute and 39 seconds. i wonder how much longer this is going to be. my phone is ringing. oh its amy i don't feel like talking to her where is ter there it is yeah she really gets annoying sometimes i really care about her but sometimes i can't stand it man i still have only been oops accidentally typed an m what should i write about what do i like i like baseball i still haven't watch espn to find out what happened with the astos i hope they are still in first place what to write about what to oops man i wish that i was better at typing they are talking about people famous on tv that are reflecting on what they were doing at age 17 man i'm almost 19 17 seems like it wasc so long ago jessica simpson is fine she is talking on tv right now i wish that she was my girlfriend she is really fine man 20 minutes seems a lot longer than i thought or hoped it would be this seems like it is taking forever man i hope it rains tomorrow so i don't have to work work is getting worse and worse every day that i work i just want to get it over with so that i can get paid i remember when i had to do one of these things in elementary school i wonder what grade it was maybe it was in middle school with mrs webber she was a really goods teacher i wonder what ever happened to her i wonder if she still works at trinity she was a hard teacher but a very good one i wonder how much longer man i am almost finished oh i am ,0
"although overall, i am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. i'm actually on my own. i can't believe it - for the first time, i won't have my parents to rely on everything for. i'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. and i think i'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. even though i've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. i don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. i still would've preferred going to the college i wanted to go to, columbia u. i guess i'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, i'll just have to accept it. right now it's late, almost midnight. i am tired and i have so much to say right now but i just can't get it all out. most of what i think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what i actually want to pursue in my education. do i really have the commitment to study medicine? what am i going to major in? i'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. a lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. right now my parents are preparing for their trip to india. they haven't been there in 2 years. i feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. somehow i feel my parents' families resent me because i was actually born in america. also, i don't really feel """"indian. """" i am american in the full sense of the word. that's been a huge conflict i've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. the indian community i have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which i dislike. so i find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. however, i find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because i act different. i don't always hang out with indian people. in fact, i rarely do. strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by me, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. i don't know why i can be so bitter about this subject. i guess i just resent the idea of the indian culture trying to shape my life. i am about me, not about being indian. ok now that i'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, i'm going to complain about something else. how about religion? i am very proud of the fact that i am a christian. however, my parents don't seem to believe i am religious because i do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. i am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. it's the same way with the indian church i used to go to. i left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. as long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. i couldn't stand it so i left for a better church. spiritually i am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. right now, my roommate is out partying and i'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, i don't really feel lonely. i actually like being by myself. with others sometimes i feel like i have to act like i'm someone else. alone, i can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but i feel like typing more. i wonder if people think i'm some kind of nerd or recluse. i hate when people assume that about me since i'm not a party person and i do well in school. i really am different from most people, and i like that about me. when i get married and have kids (if i even want to have kids), that's something important i want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. that's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and i don't care what other people think. maybe i'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think i have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. i really do have a lot of friends. basically i look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person i want to befriend. so as i'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, i have to express a couple feelings. i'm excited about my new beginning in life at ut. i'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. i know i am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, i think i must end this. ok no i wont, haha! i still have a little more to say. i am a night person. i don't know why. but i just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. i feel like i can do things i couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. i wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? i know i'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. i wonder how much less people think of me because i am fat. i am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- i'm not dieting because of what other people think. i know it's not healthy for me, and believe me, i intend to live a long healthy life, and i need to start. sometimes i feel i am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. i don't intend to be a statistic of the """"freshman 15.

"this is what i need to do. type with my friends in the messenger its really addicting. lmaooo. well i love to listen to music. its really soothing for me and i fell weird with out it. i love tuty of brazeros musical( ; ; my favorite group) i wonder when they are going to come back.

""""in the car wash. """" maybe because i heard it for too long. its a remix. its lonely in my room. i have nothing to do but be here in the computer. reflecting back on high school it was exciting but i wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable. i made it to prom court. i was beaten by a girl that never attended school. how can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends. we were all great students. and never broke the rules!!! its beb 11 mins and well i have a million things tuning through my head. i miss my family (as whole) because they went to mexico with out me. this the first year they do it and i feel left out. but am having a blast here in the university of texas and i cannot ask for anything better. i love austin. this were i been living for 18 years. i think i love music because of this """"the live music capital of the world"""" music was everywhere i turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of mcdonalds. in the laundry thing and well my mom loves to dance. which leaves me think. what am i going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert. i love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more. """"the artist"""" for most part are really down to earth and i look forward to every dance there is. its been two weeks since school started, yet our room still stinks!!!!!! we cannot take the smell out. being in the ninth floor. we cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of nowhere land stuck in a corner were no body comes an visit us. that's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. its sunny outside its not hot like it usually is. i love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. that little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. i love that smell of wet grass as well. ummmmmmmmmmmm. so one did popcorn and i smell it all the way over here. 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry i got distracted by the timer less then am done. it been distracting since it started ",0
" last night i laid down and i couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, i have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. i have music psychology and ceramics. i'm good at ceramics though cause i got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. i have a lot of great memories. i miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. i feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. i am finally realizing the value of that too. i think its the art . i love art its constantly running thorough my head. the way i look at everything, the way i find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way i am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. i am going to incubus on wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. i feel like i am taking 15 hours but i'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. i am going to work at the frank erwin center hopefully . i was a waitress this summer at el chico. i love mexican food. i am so damn hungry right now. oops can i cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and i felt it necessary. i feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately i've been dead set on being responsible and i am hell bent on making all a's , so when i can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because i was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and i could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that i've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. i remember when i moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and i remember after my dad left standing there looking around. i had no phone, no friends, and no clue and i think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when i look back i have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? i don't know i am just writing as i go along. i like to write. i write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. i like to vent, i need to vent. its almost like when i write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. i don't know maybe i'm weird. i wish i could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so i do poetry as well. but i am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? i am in love. i am not quick to say that either and it is not something i was trying to do or even wanted, but i have found my soul mate believe it or not. he is perfect, and believe me i am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the adhd ) and i love his mind because i appreciate things i cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all i want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. i love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why i like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. i make myself laugh too. i am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. i love that.

"right now my mind says why the hell do i have to do this. i'm not up to doing this crap because i just woke up and i realized that i have to get this homework done before it is due in class. i have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl i love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and i don't appreciate that. anyway i have realized that i have been slacking off in my classes and i have to get started on doing all of my homework because if i don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and i am going to be here all alone. i think that at he is stupid for what he did and i hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose, then i will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, i am also thinking about this girl named felicia that i met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that i have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. i don't think that she thinks much about me but i sure do hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy i am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so i we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out.

"last week i took a chinese clep test. it started out very well, i understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. as you know, the cantonese language is written in two different formats. one way, the tradition way, was the one i learned since i was a little kid. the other format was a newer, i believe it originated in hong kong or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking"""". anyways, i opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. so i spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. then, i decided to just skip through to the end. that is when i figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. """"damn it!"""" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. but of course, that was last week, and i already have my results back from the test. i believe i did relatively well. relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. today, monday, is the first day i have been to my rlm biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. i must say, i am completely exhausted. biology discussion was quite an episode. we had an ta that had a really really bad accent. much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. then we took a quiz, which i found to be a bit difficult because i didn't understand teh oral review. i had to buy books today. spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that i probably won't be needing much. i could have found many many other uses for that 129, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. geez, look at my grammar in this essay, i think my english teacher would have a heart attack. psych class was pretty interesting today. dr. pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. i was completely fascinated by the experiment. too bad i can't say the same for my philosophy class. its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. and so i obeyed. i notice that when i'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. but of course, i wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. you can definitely tell at what point in the lecture i crashed. the funniest part is, i lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. i think since i have been here at ut for the fall, i have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. i have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. i worry about other stupid things that i feel the need not to bring up at this moment. however, i have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. i have been recreating too much. this weekend though, we went to barton springs to see a friend that came up to visit us from utsa. barton springs was nothing like i had imagined. i absolutely loved it. everything except the coldass water. then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. it felt like summer again. of course, i had enrolled in the ut summer program. a little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. i miss summer.

"everything we experience is filtered through our mind, and if that mind is contaminated by thoughts, preconceived notions, or the need to continuously categorize everything our experiences become tainted. later when we realize the error, the experience seems somewhat lost because what it was abased on is no longer true. thinking about past experiences blinds you to the present especially when trying to compare the two. the past cannot be altered by the realization of a mistake, but it can't be relived at the same time. to move along, trusting nothing and everything, simultaneously and exclusively, through each experience, is to forgo all attachment, all security, all dependence, all crutches. the things that you continue, to do out of routine, out of habit is not something done for love. love can exist without any sort of routine if all attachment is dissolved. evolution involves change, change can catch you offguard but it is inevitable. to be strong is to change, to adapt to each situation and expect nothing. unmet expectations, grasping to the future, grasping to the past &#8211;all are causes of suffering, anxiety, and tension. to evolve is to transcend the suffering anxiety and tension and necessitates eliminating the causes of pain that reside in your own mind. people can inflict pain and suffering only if you let them, if your mind is contaminated by constructs. objectifying experience removes the suffering but also removes the joy. to cleanse your mind is not the same as objectifying everything around you. to evolve is to transcend the suffering and still experience. everything everywhere is constantly changing so if you hold on to it, its going to drag you around, but if you let go the current will carry you. kerbey lane looks really busy but we have no coffee so to flow with the current is to move through the lane of least resistance which only you know because the current is in your mind, it is your mind. the line between love and attachment is often confused and blurred because there is no line. you draw the line and you choose where to stand, but you can't be afraid to run around cross the line erase the line but you must choose. even walking the line is a choice, you cannot deny that.

"well here i go again. trying this for the last time. it took four attempts but hopefully this will be the last time that i am required to attempt this. i had to try to write this several times because my computer would not send the four other attempts at writing. so this better work. well it is really hard to do this assignment when i have already done it four times i can't believe that all the creativity has been drained out of me. i can't talk about anything funny and witty. i am so tired. i am tired of trying to do this assignment and getting rejected by the computer gods. well let me think. i am in my friend's room. she is in the psychology class as well, and she lives on my floor. she is pretty cool for letting me do this when it is almost ten o'clock and i just went running. but then again, she is also helping my roommate with her precal. what a bud! my whole floor is pretty laid back and everyone is getting along real well. we are in a small dorm, littlefield, and my only complaint is that the rooms are little. but it is a 70 year old dorm, and my mom told me when it was built the beds came out of the closet. this is really boring. my other four writings were so much more interesting then this. all i can say is that this better go through. i want to go home. but i am going to go home soon. i miss my dog. i am so boring. and i want to be a writer. i am really a more creative person but right now i feel physically drained. i am so tired. all i want is to go to sleep for a long time and not wake up. tomorrow morning i have a philosophy discussion session and i really don't want to go. but i guess that i kind of have to go. have to learn! that is why i am here isn't it! i only have five minutes left and then i can do tackle my english paper. i don't want to work anymore. i want to go to sleep. but i can keep on going a and going and going and going and i am wasting as much time as i can. we are now talking about people in the class. not good. well, i think my time is up. yeah no more typing well no, i have to go finish my english paper. i hope that this goes through because if it doesn't i will scream really loud. thank you and god bless.

"this is my stream of consciousness writing for psychology class. i'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit o. k. i had a dream two nights ago and i was at some hollywood awards ceremony. this lady introduced me to kirstie allie as i was sitting at a table. i looked over, and it was not kirstie allie but andie mcdowell, some other actress. anyway, it was weird. then on the very next night after that dream, i was watching a movie on t. v. and she was in it. i rarely see her on t. v. and i was astonished. it is very relevant, because i am reading a book right now called the celestine prophecy. this book is very cool. it talks about some ancient manuscript found in peru that is going to change every human beings consciousness. it is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 20th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. it is amazing because i have been having many of these lately such as that dream. also, on the way over here i turned on my car, and i thought of this song by jewel. i turned the station and that song was on the radio. unbelievable, right? i don't think so, man,'. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. ok i finished a focus question for history class before i came here and i also watched seinfeld. it was the one where jerry picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. george makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on t. v. george's girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then kramer tells george alright i'm not gonna sit here and talk about seinfeld for 20 minutes. i am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright you are all just a bunch of hacks. lets get ready to rumble in the bronx joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. nietzche's theory on dionysus man let's call ourselves the doors man. like the doors in your mind, acid. aldous huxley. when the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. that was a line from oliver stones, the doors good flick. it is total irony how jim morrison has a poem where he says, did you have a good life when you died, enough to base the movie on. he must have known they would make a movie about him. strange days. i'm taking tai chi classes. that should be very beneficial to me. i must do well in school this semester. man that is a big deal to me wow i'm really looking forward to the ucla football game. it should be a good one. i really want a piece of glass you know. my grandmother died last week on the same night princess diana died. was that some kind of luck, or what. i want to die at a reasonable age. death, now there's something i could talk about nope let's see mi hermano no va a california para la funeral. neither am i. is that wrong, i don't think so. man let's just increase the peace i can't believe i just said that there is a reason to live. we are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in south america for the love of peirre. they are going to read my thing and go nuts man. who am i talking to. sometimes when i'm sitting alone i think as if someone were with me. this is a good thing, for the love of my family is always going to be there.

"well, i'm sitting here at my computer right now doing my assignment for psychology i guess i'm really thinking about a lot of things right now, primarily what my plans for the weekend are going to be even though its only tuesday i am already worried about something that's going to happen several days from now sometimes i get ahead of myself i guess i really like this assignment because i like typing i feel it is one of my strong points but i haven't got to practice much since my high school typing course i was best in the class back then no one was as good a typist as i was there was a really good looking girl that sat next to me in that class her name was mary she is dating someone older than i am right now his name is vincent i don't know what his problem is he is too old for her and she is not even in college i bet he isn't faithful to her at all that is the problem with these frat guys they don't respect anyone but themselves i wish they would take some time off from their drinking sometime and think about who they are really hurting its not fair to the other kids mary's age not to get a chance to get to know her because she is so caught up with this college guy that isn't even loyal to her what a jerk oh well its not really my problem anyway i'm in college too high school is behind me even though i had a really good time in high school i miss all of my friends we really had some crazy times it seems so long ago that i was sitting in my senior english class staring out the window thinking about life at ut who would have guesses that when i got to ut i would spend time thinking about what i thought about in high school my friend is in the room right now he is a friend of mine from elementary school he went to the provisional program but didn't make his grades he goes to acc now and i think he is happy there the classes aren't too difficult, i hear i wish my classes weren't so hard i feel too stressed if i don't make good grades, my parents are going to kill me one thing i just noticed is that i noticed that i am randomly using punctuation i don't know why maybe i punctuate the things that i think are more important to me i guess that's why i'm in psychology maybe i will understand these things one of these days i think i will learn a lot in psych. as well as all my other classes they are all very interesting to me they are all liberal arts classes that will help my degree actually i don't even know my degree yet it will probably be in either government or history because i want to go to law school and my academic advisor said that those majors would be most conducive to my acceptance to a prestigious law school but the thing they said that matters most was my grade point average he said that anyone with a high gpa can get into law school regardless of their major so that was good to hear it took a lot of pressure off of me to make a decision i do not really want to make for a little while anyway both of my parents are lawyers i wonder how much that affected my decision to pursue a career in law i guess i will discover that as well sometime during this course i am very excited to be enrolled in this course i think i will discover a lot about myself well, my twenty minutes is about up i think i am going to order a pizza now i still have not eaten lunch and i am starving.

"at this very moment i feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what i see everyday. for example, there was a notice on my apartment door that i read after coming home from school. it stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex. about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby. when i ride the ut shuttle busses to school, i notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets. everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency. i don't know why i get angry when i think of this, maybe i pay too much attention to things i shouldn't. i have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational. enough of that. now i am beggining to think of all the things i must do. i feel rather confused because i don't know if i should quite my job. it is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at antonios tex mex. on top of that, i just moved from apartment complexes, and i have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment. there is an empty burger king bag infront of me and i feel guilty. you see about 1 year and 5 months ago, i used to be very fit, i mean i had it all. i'm 6 ft. tall, and during that time, i weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle, i was scorching hot. that is around the time i meat my girlfriend (i hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and i just ballooned into 265 lbs. the reason i stated earlier that i felt guilty for eating the burger was because i am trying to get back in shape. and i also feel bad because i know that my partner worries about my health. but i do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices i've made in my life, i chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also i have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.

"well today i can't believe i got on the wrong bus. i felt like such a nerd, but oh well i guess everyone has to learn somehow and every one makes mistakes. i can't believe how nice it felt outside today as compared to how hot outside it was yesterday. i am so hungry, i really wish they would have broccoli cheese soup for dinner but i know they won't. i guess i will just have a salad again. even though i eat salad almost everyday i still cannot lose the 5 pounds i gained over the summer. its not like anyone can tell but in the back of my mind i just know that i look so much bigger than i used to. when doing the pretesting earlier this week i couldn't believe all the questions they asked about eating. i can't believe that people actually can do that to their bodies. i am thankful that i do not have to worry about my body in that sense. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing right now. he lives in vegas and it is so hard being away from him. i can't believe i have loved him for 5 months. i am so scared that he will stop loving me and all of a sudden realize that he can do so much better and leave me. if i had to see him at tournaments and he had a new girlfriend i don't know what i would do. he means so much to me but no matter how many times he tells me that he loves me and that he misses me i never believe him. he gets mad that i don't trust him but he should blame that on my ex-boyfriend not me. oh well i guess if it is meant to be than it will be. i am listening to the saddest song called butterfly kisses, about a father and daughter. i have missed my dad and dogs the most since i have been gone. my dad is one of my best friends and he always knows exactly what to do. he is the only reason i want to do well in school, just to make him proud is the best feeling in the world. i wish i could tell my dad that i loved him but for some reason we never express those feelings. i know he loves me a lot because he pays for me to go to school and to fly all over the country to do taekwondo, but i wish it would be ok if i could hug him. instead we always bow and shake hands, that's how you do in in taekwondo. he would do anything to make me happy and he even spent 100 dollars to change my flight so at fall nationals i could spend an extra day with my boyfriend. on the other hand, my mom and i do not get along so well all the time. i love her and when i was sick last weekend she came up and brought me soup and took me shopping, but i don't respect her because she can be very rude to people and when she gets mad she can be mentally abusive. it was horrible living with her when i was 13-17, by the time i was 18 i started fighting back and leaving whenever she would yell at me. my biggest fear besides dying is turning into her and yelling at my kids like she yelled at me. i don't know why my dad still loves her and how he can put up with it, it is not normal how she talks to him or me sometimes. she doesn't understand why i don't want her around my friends or my boyfriend but its because i don't want her to turn into that other person and yell at me in front of them because it really is frightening. my friend matt just came over to distract me and prevent me from getting an a on this assignment which seems to have no real purpose, but maybe it will after i finish and turn this in.

"first of i would like to clear something up. yes you did pay for bally's but for the money you paid i wore walamrt and target clothes and payless shoes. i also hardly think that the $30 a month you paid for me equates to the hundreds you pay for andrew. second i paid for that fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at s&s. in no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. i did earn a lot of money this summer. i spent very little of it and saved most of it - so you wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. i don't think having a car is a sign of love- i think it is a sign of favoritism. that's what makes me cry and get really upset. the two main reason's andrew got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and dad obviously identifies with him more. nevermind that i try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. i guess maybe if i act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one i could get a little appreciation in this family. having a car here is imparactical and honestly, i don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. the damamge is done. my whole life i felt loved and i'm not saying i don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. i was very upset. not that i didn't mean what i wrote, but i could of said it in a kinder way. i had a really long talk about it with will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. the reason i get so upset is not because i want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. logically i know it means nothing, but i still hurt when i think about it. i'm really confused. i think i get emotional about it because i think it's so unfair, i can't do anything about it, and i get so mad i cry. another thing i have observed is i can't talk to dad about it. i don't know why i feel it necessary to """"protect him"""" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. i guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that """"he couldn't afford it"""" i can't even really talk about it with you; i have to write about it. i guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as i can remember. maybe i get sad about it because i don't understand why i feel this way and no one understands my feelings. i really meant it when i said i didn't know what could return me to the way i felt before the incident. and all the while i'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. i was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. here, no one loves me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that i was sure of at home. the car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why i'm upset about it. i know that objects don't measure love. it's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. i guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. this letter itself is really ironic in some way. i write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here i am up at midnight worrying about yours. well i'm going to bed now, i've got school and work tomorrow.

"i have no clue how to start this. i haven't bought my psychology book yet. is that bad? i wish i could do that dj thing at the beginning of class. the guy last time played horrible music. i made a friend in that class named kelly. she seems cool. i hope we get to hang out. this feels like a diary entry. is that what it's supposed to be like? today natalie and i went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. one girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. it really got on my nerves. not because i'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. rob is really annoying me. i'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. but hang out with him at the same time. and eric. i don't know what to do with eric. i don't know if i love him or not. i don't know if i'll ever really be in love. he says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for me to say sweet things back to him. but i don't know if i really feel it or not. i think i'm really heartless. and i haven't been in english for a long time! i'm forgetting whether to capitalize the i"""" in some words. odd. my arm hurts. am i going to have to keep this up for 20 minutes? i wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. mine is all boring teenage bullshit. let's try and write something deep. it's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. all the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. the faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. aaaand i'm spent. that was so lame. bullshit, as my english teacher would say. he is really cool. he made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. and he taught at pomona, which is my harvard. i would love to go to school in california. hopefully next year i can go to sfsu and be near eric and see if this thing will really work out. are boys the only thing on my mind? am i really that shallow? at this moment, i'm afraid so. i blanked. i have to start a new stream. i'm losing a lot of weight, i think. my wrists are smaller than they used to be. i don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. i want to be super skinny. and if not eating is how i have to get there, i just might do it. i don't think i'm fat right now. there are just parts of me that could be smaller. and i'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. i'll be the anorexic that always eats milky way. because those are so good and i could never give them up. when do i become an adult? i have no clue where that came from. but really. when? it's really quiet in here. i can hear natalie typing on occasion. she is a good student. always on top of things. our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. the other day it smelled like clam chowder. not pleasant. i miss my family. i never thought i would. i don't miss them so much that i'd cry or be terribly homesick. i mainly miss the meals. and the fact that if i was sick they would go and buy me what i needed. i took birth control for the first time on friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. it made me appreciate my mom so much more, which i rarely do. yes, i am a spoiled brat. i didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but i am one nonetheless. and i have no concept of money because i am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in october to go see eric again. and my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. i'm not going to tell her this time. i'll give natalie all the information. and pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. i like our dorm room. it has a lot of character. i love our posters. natalie and i have the same tastes in a lot of things. of course, i'd much rather have my best friend monica as a roommate. i miss her so much. and with her, i do miss her to tears. she is the only one i could be myself around. i love her so much. and feel horrible about what i did to her last year. i blew her off. i wasn't a good friend. and i'll never forgive myself for it. the girls across the hall from us just got home. i don't like them that much. jenny is nice. she listens to morrissey. and, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. most morrissey girls are lesbians. and paige, the other girl, is really stuck-up. and she listens to lots of local bands from dallas that i despise. so yes. it takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. i'm very selective with friends. which i shouldn't be because i'm not the coolest person to hang out with. and boy do i have low self-esteem. i constantly put myself down. eric gets annoyed with it. and i type really hard, too. i think natalie is annoyed with this sound right now. oh well. seriously, is someone going to read this? is there a right or wrong way to do it? i hope not. i'm sure i'm doing it the wrong way. rob just told me that he is joining the army. i don't want him to. and i told him why. and he told me not to be punk rock because i'm an indie princess. that's so lame. just because i listen to that kind of music doesn't mean i can't have political views. and this was a good exercise. very therapeutic. thank you, professor!

"the one thing that amazes me the most is the complexity of the female mind. at one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. if you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. the more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. the only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. true, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. no matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. i've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that i will ever be able to understand. the saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. i think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. the more you drink it in, the better it feels. you know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. the only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. the old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. it may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. that or it seems less pathetic. it's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. when i was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. my parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that i listened to, so i always told myself that if i ever became a musician, i would never include those kind of things in my songs. however, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. however, i wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of eminem. i also think that people overreact to his music. he is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician.

"things have changed so much since i got to college. everything has taken a complete and utter flipside to the norm. i came here with two of my best friends from high school and now we are no longer speaking. things get complicated. my plans for the upcoming and muchawaited texas'oklahoma game has managed to break up a friendship very important to me. its insane that such a petty conflict in such an unimportant situation can kill something that i've known so well for the past few years. regardless, my life is so different now. i went through high school on a very tight leash with my parents and now i have no restrictions. no more """"be in by one o'clock"""", no more """"you can't spend the night out"""" no more """"do your homework"""". even though i'm supported by them primarily, i make my own decisions now. it seems a lot easier to go with the flow of things around here, do what i really want to do and not worry about what my parents think is the best decision or the right choice. school has also changed. i love my classes, my professors are wonderful, but the actual academics are a good deal harder. i went to a 5a school taking all honors classes, and everyone told me how the hard academics i was in then would make ut a breeze. wroooong. i'm going to pull through, i'm determined. i love where i am.

" today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. i sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes i feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. we aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 11th. i mean the nice safe world i lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. i didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. now, i occasionally do doubt. and most of all, thinking about the 11th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards america, i am angry at the world, at people, i don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 5 will grow up in. she is a very close part of me, i feel very close and love her very much. she's my little sis. and to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. i mean on ond hand i am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in texas far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, i will be fine. and then i get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how i am american and she is american and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. alyssa is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, i would be devistated if anything happened to her, i would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. i feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that americans have adopted. i am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as i can because i do not want her to fear life. i want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world i grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but i face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. i find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like i am alternating bewteen a world where i realize the new threats involved with iraq and the possibility of war. just recently, i started paying close attention to the news coverage of saddam hessein and his disregard to un weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. i relize the seriousness of the iraq conflict, the seriousness of the 11th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. maybe because i am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. nevertheless, i am bothered by this whole change in our world. i have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, i have plans of becoming a doctor one day and i have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. i never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. i am 20, should this much stuff be present in my life? you know, i heard amazing grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on tv tonight and was emotionally moved. that song always does that to me. it can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. i wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. that was the first song i ever played on the piano and trumpet if i am remembering correctly. i miss my parents, mostly my little sister. i am going back this weekend, but i am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because i have mcuh homework to finish. i guess thats another struggles i am dealing with in my life currently. i started thinking about how much i love my grandparents. they live right up a little path from our house in san antonio and i realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. i would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. now i rarely ever see them because i am in college. i will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time i have now to spend with them? is spending time in college worth the sacrifice i am making. why can't i spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on.

"so, i'm sitting here staring at the computer screen. i wonder what i'm supposed to write about. thousands of ideas enter my mind, but one completely stands out. my roommate is again in a fight with her boyfriend. how can one person have so much anger trapped up inside of them? how can one person be so hurt and so hurtful to or from another. i know that i sometimes get in fights with my boyfriend. but they are nothing like this. i just don't really understand her sometimes. she complains that they don't talk enough, but when they are on the phone they have absolutely nothing to talk about. what else is new, all she does is sit around in the room waiting for him to call all of the time. i go to class, come back, and there she sits still. i just can't do that. i mean, i'm dedicated and love my boyfriend, but not to the point of putting my own happiness and life on the line for one person. i don't think that i'm selfish, i feel like i have my priorities straighter. except i happen to be the one without the degree plan that everyone else already has set up. i don't know what i want to do with the rest of my life. there are so many opportunities out there, how do you know deadon what you would like to be? my interests change daytoday. one day i want to do this, then the next day it's this other thing. the only sure thing and deadmindset thing that i'm involved with is my boyfriend. we've been together for a long time, and i've never felt as strong about anyone as i feel about him. we make all these plans for our future together that i hope come true. but they are only things that i want right now. i would love to marry this guy, i've been settled down for over a year now, and i'm happy this way. we both adjusted our lives for each other. i just wish the time was here. but i can't help to think of that continuous thought in the back of my head, of what if. i am extremely superstitious. i believe that there is a reason why we met each other, and every event that has happened since, has. but maybe i don't always get what i want because i'm supposed to meet someone else while he is not around. i have never been happier in my life, and i am always afraid of change. this move down here to college shuck me up enough. now things are finally getting settled and i'm meeting tons of people, but i don't know whether or not i should dedicate my time to what i am giving it to. i make time for everyone, but not always for everyone. i keep a lot of time to myself. i hate having to turn people down, but it seems as if i am always doing that. tomorrow my friend invited me over for dinner, and that should be a lot of fun. we have kind of lost touch, and it should be good for us to get back into the swing of things. well, i think that has been twenty minutes. i hope you enjoyed my """"interesting"""" train of thought.

"as i sit here in my dorm room, i am thinking about what i am supposed to do tonight. i have signed with the fraternity sigma alpha mu and i am not sure what pledging is going to be like. it could be tough and it could be easy. my roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so i need to try to be quiet as i type. i am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. there are so many people here and i am not sure whether i am fitting in well or not. anyway, i get side tracked easily. i am going to the house at 7 pm and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. i am anxious to meet all the cool guys who i am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. i miss all my close friends at home. i live in atlanta georgia and they are mostly going to uga but some of them are spread out across the country. i miss my friend pamela the most and my best friend michael the 2nd most but hey i hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. my mom worries me cause she thinks i am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really i'm not and i am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. i miss my little brother too. he is 13 years old and he is in 8th grade. i hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause i know i did. i keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. he believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. my great grandmother is very sick and she is 97 years old. i went to visit her the day before i left for school and i was thinking that i may never see her again. she has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, i know that god was the one who wanted her up there. m<y roommate is going to nap now for real and i am supposed to wake him up in an hour. i hope i'm not still typing by then. the room is quiet now and i am the only one still making noise. my suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. i kind of always think about what i am going to be when i get older and when i am married and who am i going to marry and what my profession is going to be. i want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and i am not sure if i can be that. but i set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. i want to be successful and have a family of 4 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who i am not for what i look like or how much money i make. i am ending my stories with a quote :shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars.

"o. k. now i have 20 minutes to write whatever i'm thinking. humm. that's a lot of time and to be honest i can't think of anything to say right now. i'm tired and hungry even though i just ate. overslept last night so my body is killing me at the moment. busted my head playing football yesterday and now my head is killing me. glad i didn't have to get stitches cause that would have been bad considering that would cost a lot plus i don't like stitches. i don't like needles at all for some reason. i want to be a doctor though so that is kind of crazy. how can you be a doctor if you don't like stitches. well a couple minutes have passed and basically i'm not sure if i'm doing this right. you want me to talk about my feelings huh. i'm tired, miss home, and uncomfortable basically. i feel good right now i guess, i mean i'm not cold or anything or hot. just sitting here without my shirt in a chair. you told me not to correct my spelling but i missed the r in shirt earlier and spelled shit, and well i don't want to say just sitting here without my shit, so i corrected it. i'm a pretty good typer i guess. i know where all the keys are and everything and i don't make too many mistakes. i'm using aol and one of my friends keeps instant messaging me and well i can't reply back cause i have to get this done. i keep putting this assignment off, because i'm with this fraternity phi-psi and well it takes up a lot of my time and i really don't have much time to get on the computer and do this. i could easily have done it on paper cause we have to be at the house for 3 hours everyday for study hours. the thing is we don't have computers there and we are supposed to be in this room doing our homework, and well hard to do this assignment when you don't have a computer handy. it says to do it in seperate days, but i just finally remembered to do this. actually i knew yesterday but the whole day i was at the frat house doing chores to get ready for the big party. i then went to the big party and had a good time. i know you're probably thinking, if you have time to go to the party then you had time to do this. my answer is true very true, but when you spend 4 hours getting ready for a party you want to enjoy it you know what i mean. i'm really tired of doing this. 20 minutes is a long time and there are some football games going and i want to watch them and well if i do then i won't be able to type cause my mind would be somewhere else. i cleaned my room the other day and so it looks pretty nice. my roomates side is really bad, but mine looks good so that's all that matters. i'm with the phi-psi fraternity and he's with the atos and well they are the biggest rival fraternities on campus. don't really know much about it, except for the fact they hate each other. all i know is that phi-psi put a sign up in front of the ato house that said something like you can't spell faggot without ato. that was pretty creative in my opinion so i give them credit for that. humm. nothing much to say, and still have a couple more minutes to ramble and ramble. i'll sing some songs, that'll pass the time. under the bridge downtown i used to something something, o. k. so i don't know that one. it must be your skin cause i'm sinking in, it must be your feel cause i cannot feel, it must be your . o. k. don't know that one either. i remember when we used to sit in the county yard of brooklyn. good times we had oh good times we lost a long the way a you aya ay. no woman no cry. no woman no cry. say say. hey little sister, don't shed no tear. that's all i know about that one. i'm sure i know a song completely just can't think of any right now. really don't listen to the words anyway. always pay attention to the beat, cause i play guitar and i like to play and listen to the instruments rather than the words. i don't know just do. time is winding down. to be honest i forgot when i started. i think it was 2:06 and well it is now 2:23 so it is almost time. really want to watch the cowboy game, cause it's going on right now. jeopardy themes song. do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do. o. k. that was a waste of time. i wonder if you actually time this. like if it is a test to see who really finishes this crazy test. 20 minutes is a long time, and well i'm as impatient as someone who really has to pee and is waiting on a stall. i like using analogies, makes things more interesting. well i'm down to my final minute i think. if you are timing this than i tried to do the whole time, but i'm sick of being here. i'll give it another minute or two. hummmm. that is all i'm thinking right now. la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la. it's that off to work we go song. we whistle that when we do work at the fraternity. it's kind of funny i guess. o. k. i gave it another minute and well peace i'm out of here. actually i'll be right back cause i have to do the other assignment now.

for the past few days and now i have been thinking a lot about my friends back hone. i am thinking of all the good times we had and how i miss them a lot. and of course i am thinking about girls and especially one of them. i also thinking aout this summer and how i met a lot of different kinds of people by attending the preview program and gettting an early start on college. adjusting from hihg school took college took a little bit of time. having fun and partying are always on my mind. i partied a lot this summer. it was a lot easier then because i only had to worry about two classes; one of them was pre-cal and i knew i could hadle that so it was basically only e306. some other thoughts that also come to my mind at this moment are thoughts about my parents and how i miss them and my rest of my family back home. thinking about that sometimes makes me sad but i don't let it get to me. i am usually a very happy person and people can tell when something is bothering me or not. lately i have not gone out mainly because no one has really invited me go out with them. but also because i have been a little low on money. there is money in the bank but i don't know for how long there will be money there. this summer i spent a lot more monwy than i should have spent. i don't usually worry about money but i really spent a lot and the worst part of it is that i don't know waht i spent it on. at this instant i am thinkign about my grades i got this summer. i was disappointed with them because i know i could of done better. i got a b in english in which i am pretty satisfied because i can't write good at all. but i know i should of gotten an a in pre cal. i put a lot of effort and i thought i deserved an a but the teacher ws sort of a bi---- towards the end. i was really frustrated with this. i had never been so caught on grades until this occurred. so instead of starting my college career with a 3. 5 i started with a f******* 3. 0. this really frieken sucks big time. ,0
"wanna see the real you- i love this song. by the suicide machines. i saw them last spring break with the descendents. good show. now green world is on. this is weird, trying to write continuously for 20 minutes. you tend to think differently when you're forced to. like today, those questionnaires in psych class. i think i analyzed them too much and tricked myself into answering differently. oh well. i have a lot of shit i need to be doing like returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class. that class sucks. how can journalists shove a camera and microphone in someone's face when they're in mourning or whatever. and those guys who caused the princess di's wreck just for some pictures. it makes me sick. do they have no feelings or sympathy whatsoever? does anyone? how the hell am i going to find a job that i like that doesn't require making it to the top, no matter who you step on to get there. i guess all jobs are like that i'm just not a competitive person at all. never was. i don't need to put other people down or be the best at everything in order to feel good or proud like tough guys. sure i'm proud of what i can do but i could never hurt another soul doing it. well the music's off now and its quiet here in my castilian dorm room except for the fan. my boyfriend and my friends are upstairs, probably watching t. v. i wonder if he wants to go to that less than jake show tonight i want to. they're pretty good. my back hurts. i need to go to a chiropractor cant believe this stuff going through my head. how boring. i do think about interesting things sometimes. a few nights ago my boyfriend (kevin) and me and three other girls got into a huge (drunk) argument about how the world would be different if women were in all power. then we starting arguing, are gender differences biological or environmental? kevin thinks they're environmental, and has a nerdy, stubborn, math'scientist guy and shows very little emotions. marita and i said no, its about 50'50, because women are born with these instincts that men will never know until they grow uteruses and give birth. ok i have 5 more minutes to write. my hair feels weird. i cut about a foot off 2 days ago. it was down to my waist now its to my chin. i feel bald. i wonder if i should dye it again. last year it was purple. man i'm doing it again, rambling on about boring stupid shit. i wonder if everyone else sounds as dumb as me, chatting away about stuff nobody really cares about. for twenty minutes. all to make a good grade. why is so much emphasis placed on grades i wonder. they don't measure your intelligence. some people always do their homework and make good grades. that me. some people study and study but still bomb tests. that's me too. tests suck. especially true false questions. i analyze those too much until i confuse myself. kevin doesn't have to study and aces every test. no fair. well looks like my time is up. if anyone actually read this, sorry. fun job huh. i guess you've read much weirder stuff than this anyway. well adios.

"i am thinking about calculus. i wish i could be working on calculus instead of doing this assignment. i wonder if i am doing this assignment correctly. do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking, or in question'sentence format. well i made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how i have been taught to write at school for so long. i am hungry. i should have made prepared something in the oven, so when i am done with this assignment i would be able to eat it. now i have started so i must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty, or approximately 17 more minutes. i am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is. i guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking. i want to type things in here as if i was talking to someone, but then again i quickly remember that i am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness. how fast should i be typing. should i think about it, then type it, or think about it as i am typing it, or is it a combination of both. today, i have thought so much about thinking. a new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible. i can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus i am better able to control what i am thinking. this is good because the more control of yourself you have, the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also. i think that sentence did not make much sense but i know that i know what i am talking about. i am still really hungry. i wonder how many minutes i have to go. oh, its at the top of the screen, so far i have completed 8 minutes. what else is there to talk about? i don'e exactly know what im thinking about right now. wait. ok. . i think i am thinking too hard. well what would you like me to write about. what i think about really depends on what i am trying to think about. and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank. but then again, it is not blank at all. i feel like today was a great day. everyday that i am alive is a great day. i also think that i worry too much, but when i worry less i have time to think about the things that really matter. but what really matters? i am soooooooooo hungry. i only have 9 more minutes to go. this writing assignment has to be one of the easiest, requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments. but this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that i am actually starting to see how this (thinking' stream of consciousness) works. once i master it, i feel like i will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world. to find one's self. ok. . now my stomach is growling. i will be so happy when today is over and i get to lay my head to rest. i am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that i think about it. it really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break. today i feel like my mind has been in overdrive. i have had at least three people tell me i am deep, and i met alot more people today. user's guide. this book sitting right in front of me. i guess i took a break in thinking, and that is what i saw. i am so tired. physically, mentally. i have not pushed myself as much as i did today, and somehow i know it will be for the better. i am so glad that my parent's pushed me to go to college. i think it is an absolutely great'priceless experience that everyone owe's to themselves. knowledge is power, knowledge about one's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life. i love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior. well i just looked at the time again and i have approximately 30 more seconds. i ho ",1

"some of this indian music my roommate listens to is o. k. the american songs she listens to are cheesy ones from the 80s, except the u2 song she likes. i could see mike patton covering this song. it is good for a pop song and he could make it sound really good with his voice. but i guess he is discerning in choosing which songs to cover. kind of like a music snob. who knows. i wish there was someone here who would have went with me to see richard buckner tonight. i would have gone alone but i am kind of afraid i would be the youngest person there, and i wouldn't have fun and it would be a waste of $10. and a waste of time because i have to study more. i spent too much time studying for speech and not enough for some of my other classes, although over the weekend i will have lots of time to catch up on studying. unless my friends keep coming over. i wish next year my friends will move to austin and we could share a place or something. they have a lot more freedom than me, it is unfair. it was decided i would go to college before i was born. for some of them they knew they were never going to go. i think expanding your mind in college is good though, there is practically nothing else i could do at this age besides get a minimum wage job or try to become a manager at a grocery store or something. my managers at the grocery store were pretty young, i suspect some of them are saving to go to college or something because they are taking classes at the junior college. i guess i am very privileged to not have to worry about money for college. i still feel guilty spending any money that i haven't earned at a job. some of my friends who are not well off and are not going to college do not feel bad about asking their parents for money and not even have a job! this song is horrible. i wish i could be ruder and tell my roommate to stop talking and not play cheesy music. i hope she doesn't see this. i don't think i am well suited to be in the business school. i am taking a class which involves marketing yourself which for some reason is very depressing. do you really need to take a class on eye contact? i more admire people who have made their way in the businesses world accidentally. not like pumped out of a school. like david geffen. he almost failed high school i think. but somehow he is good at running music companies. kind of depressing like a kurt vonnegut book. marketing yourself is a very depressing concept to me. the teacher in that class is sickeningly sweet. kind of crazy but i think i can tell that i am not suited to be a business person because i think my class where i have to learn how long to hold a gaze is creepy. i don't want to be taught how to suck up to corporate business people! i do not care about money very much, just as long as i don't have debts. i would live very simply in order to just not have debts. i would feel very bad if i did not pay my parents back by raising me. i don't want to buy a bmw. i wish i had more guts to find something else to do. why haven't i made any friends from my dorm? it is hard to find the kind of people i like to hang out with, laid back, good taste in art, and what else? it took me a long time to find some good friends in kingwood. i really should make friends instead of waiting for them to make me. story of my life. please please stop saying your homework out loud i'm going crazy. you better go home this weekend, roommate.

" today is a dreary day. the clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. i think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. i almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. i don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if i just think it is because that is what i have always thought. i want to be quiet. silent. reflective because i need some time to think and not be social. i don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. i think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. i need to go to that church that kelly went to , but i don't know how to get there and i feel bad that i didn't go today, even though i went to bed at 4. i need to do a better job next week. i really am begining to miss omar and my family. living in austin is fun but i think i am going to get sick of it if i don't take charge of my life now. i want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. i want to be different and i haven't found exactly what i'm looking for. i still haven't found what i'm searching for. it is really hot in here. i wish i could turn the air down. but katy is asleep. she is so crazy. i guess i like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. but i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if i am not careful. i really want to go shopping but i don't have time. maybe tomorrow. i want to buy so many things. i have so many ideas but i have no money. whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. i could have so much fun if i had a whole bunch of money. i would go to all the vintage stores in austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. i think then i would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? i wish that i was bulletproof. i wish omar was here. we could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. we need each other. he can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. and i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. it would be so great. oh well, i don't think that will happen. last nite was soo crazy. but i am glad i went, just because i need to experience all that i can so i can really know what i stand for and am comfortable with. if i just stay here and do things i know, then i will never be sure if i am really being real, or just what i think is real. i need to try everything so i will know what i'm not missing. or what i need to get more involved in. i hope heather, athena and i can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. i think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. i can't belive i cut myself on my bed today. that is so retarded. and it really hurts. i think allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how omar and ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. i can't belive it. i love radiohead. it is so comforting. at least i don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. it is a strange feeling but i really like it. it's like, i can do anything and no one will know if i don't want them to. that is a eerie and almost scary feeling. sometimes, when i consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. i am tempted to think there are no little things. i hope omar will write me a song sometime. he really needs to. i can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. i wonder if i just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. i would think that naturally he would, but then again i can rarely predict him. he would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. that is sad. i really wish he would be different . he has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. ahh. ohh well, it will work out. i am glad i have him, because i don't want anyone else,. . no one. i a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. well, this is almost the end. the end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. i have so much to do today. i love this music. i want to paint. i need to create something beautiful, and be productive. this is actually the beginning. not the end. here i go. this is going to be one great year. i have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep.

" i really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. it's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so i guess there is not much we can do about it. when i listen to music, i like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but i parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. i also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. music helps me go to sleep also. i can never really fall asleep to it, but i will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. i've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. why is that? usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, i also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. i still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that i know they are ok, makes me feel better. even if i keep going back to the same part of the dream i try my best to get them out of danger. i have a very strong family background. when i was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect family and that nothing could ever go wrong. i always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. one of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. i don't think i could handle my mother calling me a name like that. i think i have a very good relationship with my mother but i know that i don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. i've noticed that i have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. i guess that is because i'm afraid to trust one person so much, but i don't think that is a bad thing. i just think that i'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. i guess that is because in junior high i had a group of friends that turned on me and i don't think i ever forgave them. i went my own way in high school but to this day i still think of their betrayel and i can still feel the pain from it. even though i haven't always had the best friends in the world, if i have a falling out with a friend i usually will make up with them later on in life. we might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. that also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. i've always been able to make friends with guys better than i have with girls, i really do not think i'm that much of a tomboy but i just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. my first year in college was the first time i think i made more girl friends but that also might be because i'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. i don't mind girls i just think they have more issues than guys. i also think it's really weird that i haven't found that one single person yet either. everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but i think i'll just let it happen when it happens. like even if i like one guy, there is almost always another one. i think i like like four guys right now and its terrible. one has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. he doesn't know i like him but his friends do, it's crazy. i think i've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. if a hot guy walks by i just turn to mush. i think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. he would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. he would also have to be a talker, i'm really into having good conversations. don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship i've been in has failed because of some communication issue and i think i've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. i think i am a good communicator fo. r the most part, i know i'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where i had two sisters and one brother i guess its no surprize. i've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. i can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and i think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what i do. not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. i've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. i work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me.

"right now i'm sitting in my dorm room. the tv is on and the band called the calling is playing. i really like they're music, they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease. music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time. many times i'll listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood, however, that rarely happens. i'm really kind of worried about my laundry at this time. i have honestly never washed any clothes, so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself. i have just realized how long 20 minutes is, and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be. although this task isn't particularly challenging, it's interesting to try to think about what i'm thinking about. many times i think the things i'm thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight. i've noticed this because i'm listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed. i need to make some gatorade, because i drank all of it yesterday. reese witherspoon is really hot, there's a picture of her in front of me, and she is beautiful. now there's two songs playing at the same time, and that is sort of bothering me. first of all because i like them both, second of all because it's hard to keep up with both of them. earlier i mentioned that my laundry was bothering me, well that is really a trivial task. more precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes. college is easy so far, however i haven't had any tests and just one quiz, in my spanish class. i think i fared ok on that quiz, so i'm happy about that. however, i'm still very curious as to what i actually made. when i first got to jester my allergies acted up really bad, due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room. after the first week i got acclimated to it, i guess, and now i'm doing just fine. i had an appointment at the ssb to get my allergy shots this afternoon, so i treked over there after i ate lunch. when i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots. she was paranoid that i would be mad at her, but of course i wasn't mad. it takes a lot to get me mad, and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me. so i just went about my way. i am also happy that i got my computer problem resolved. seether put on a great show at ozzfest on saturday. their lead singer sounds a lot like kurt cobain, who was awesome. all of seether's songs were really great, they impressed me. chevelle put on a good show too, as did lost prophets. wow, i find myself continually looking at the time above, to see how close i am to getting finished with this assignment. i'm really thirsty. another thing that perplexes me is the experiments for this class. i suppose i'll try to sign up for something after i finish this typing assignment. i'm really kind of worried about getting all those experiments done and all that. i guess that worry stems from not knowing that much about the experiments. lately my feet have started hurting a little bit, well, i guess it's not really a hurt , but more of a burn. perhaps my soles are giving out. wow, i'm almost finished, i have less than 15 seconds left. this was really kind of cool, the 20 minutes went by pretty fast, bye.

" hi. my name is shanique annette roberson. usually when i have to write something i like to introduce myself first. i did not prewrite this i promise. i was born november 27, 1985 (the day before thanksgiving). i am now 18 years old and am excited about being in the college of engineering at the university of texas at austin as a biomedical engineering major. i love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. some things that i would like to do before i leave austin or before i graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( i don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. i would also like to get involved in a good service organization. i love service and helping other people. oh! about my family. i am the daughter of lee and nancy roberson of bay city, tx. i have one older sister, joyce evette roberson. my father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the u. s. navy. she (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to iraq as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). she has now been restationed to florida. this makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. she picked a bad state to go to. anyway, i told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as i could come and visit at least once (ha! like i could really decide where she would go. i just thought i'd try it). she would have flown me to iraq to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in egypt but my mom wouldn't let me go. she didn't want the both of us over there. however, i plan to go visit in florida either during christmas break or spring break. my thoughts have now shifted to the wells family. this is a family or couple that i meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. i had gone to national baptist conference in florida and was flying back to houston by myself. they told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. when we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 4 years now. we send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. i think that that is just amazing. what esle to talk about???? ok i am just getting words now. (friends, other homework, love,oh) let me tell you about the home i would like. i was raised in a somewhat country area and i came seem to get awat from that. i would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and i know that i want horses, dogs, and cats. i don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when i think of what i want my future home to look like. also i have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. i don't know exactly where i would like this house but i think i would like it to be somewhere in tx. time is almost up and this is about all that i can think of right now anyway so bye and i will see you next time. the one and only.

"i have so much reading to do. it seems in all of my classes the professors are overwhelming us with material. but i guess that is to be expected in college, or at least that's what they told us. but i will persevere. i did have above a 100 gpa in high school. so this shouldn't be too hard. but i have to maintain a 4. 0 to please myself. that's attainable too, though. i know myself good enough to know that i will put everything else aside if my grades start to slip. like last night, i really didn't want to stay in, but i had to catch up on a lot of things. yep, i'll definitely maintain. no problem. bye, bye, bye. man, i hate that song. i wish stupid songs wouldn't get stuck in my head. i've always wondered about the stars. i think it would be the ultimate thing to impress a girl if you took her on a picnic and could lay and look at the stars and point out all the constellations. hey, then maybe i should take astrology for my science. after all, i do need two semesters of a science to graduate business honors. but i heard that that class was semidifficult, and i need an easy a in my science class. it can't be that bad though. i mean, after all, how hard can looking at the stars be. but in all sciences, they find ways to talk about stuff that i wouldn't have ever imagined could be taught about. dang, i hate science. all sciences. well, i guess social sciences aren't that bad. but those aren't really sciences. just the basic ones bio, chem. , physics, yeah, can't stand those. all right, only ten minutes left. i would have guessed that in ten minutes i would have thought about more stuff. guess not. what is time? i mean, it is time to us, but why should the universe revolve around humans. i'm sure there are other beings somewhere out there, but we don't have proof. there were those circles in the wheat fields somewhere, but that's not proof. just some stupid iowan rednecks trying to get publicity. just like that kid who is now charging bobby knight with abuse. that's so stupid. just a publicity stunt. it is so apparent to everyone that he didn't do anything wrong. he may have been a little stern in the manner he addressed the kid, but that is nothing that should be brought to the forefront like this. stupid. i can't wait until college basketball starts, that is the best time of year. although i go to ut now, i will always be a duke basketball fan. i have been since i can remember. that's not bad is it? nah. i enjoy college football, but it just isn't the same to me. i guess it's because college basketball has more action, and because the kids actually care. not like the nba. all of them are lazy and just worried about the money, whereas the ncaa the kids play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back. but i guess there are some players who don't do that. oh well, i don't care. bye, bye, bye. dang, stop it. i need to hook up with a girl tonight. i've been here too long not to have yet. it really gets me how people can have random sex. i'm quite proud to be a virgin, and i will be until i get married. and i know that god will keep me strong. like my roommate. i just don't understand. bye, bye, bye. all right. this thing is finally over. one less thing i have to worry about.

"at my high school i graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. i try to sit close up to the front of the class so i don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; i think it helps. all in all, i think i am going to enjoy """"college life"""". however, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. i don't think i have read so much of textbooks my whole life. also, i find the e-mail thing a little confusing. i didn't have e-mail at my school, and i wasn't online at my home computer so i am not up to date on all the terminology. i know i shouldn't be, but i am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. i am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though i am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than i am. ( i hope! ) lately, i find computers really frusterating. i am trying to get into the pretesting page for psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. i have already completed part of the pretesting survey, and i clicked done after each section so i hope it saved my work. every day after my classes, i feel like i have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes i realize i get too stressed out over nothing. i'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. i have also learned that if i write things down i will remember to do them, and i won't get stressed out worrying if i have forgotten to do a certain assignment. although i was a little worried after the first day of classes, i don't think college will be so bad as long as i keep up with my homework like i plan and don't procrastinate like i became so accustomed to in high school. i like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. this gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. i hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. my roommates and i had to drive to taco bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. and for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. i never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any.

"the clock is ticking and i have to wake up at 8 o clock tomorrow. lots of white space on the wall and on the screen, purple hat on the side, people walking in the stairs red trees falling off the building. it is difficult to speak continuously, perhaps there should be pauses in between words but then there would be no coherency but then there is no fluctuation in tone and all the mechanics of rules and boundaries rendering the sentences more honest than not. difficult to type without thinking, every once in a while something pops into my head but prolonged thought disrupts the image and i forget what to say, and the thought of forgetting makes me think more about it, disrupting it further and pushing any sense of coherency into the deepest of abysses. hunger stirs in my stomach, quiet thoughts in my head about simple things, nostalgia, reminiscing all things past, good and bad, because there can be no good without the bad, the contrast makes all the difference. peter parker was an extraoridinary young man as a result of his radioactive bite, i fail to have any of his special abilities, lacking in the radioactive bites. does this make me less extraoridinary? or perhaps i am something of a special person, considering all the different things that happen. comic book heroes have nothing to do but save and do superpowers and shoot bad guys but in the realm of the real world i am an exemplary everyman with no superpowers making me different than peter parker. my computer is overloaded or maybe my mind is going crazy, but this has been an inordinate amount of time. 7 minutes into the assignment, it is difficult to type without stopping the train of thought im currently in. all i can think about at the moment is how different this assignment is compared to anything i have ever done for any class. flowing and ebbing out of my mind like a loose river flooding the dam, breaking the barrier and drowning out rationality. confusion and mayhem and all things in my head in disarray, unquestionably noisy because of my roommate, undeniably hot because of centralized air conditioning. tired of typing, concerned about the method of writing , and if my stream of consciousncess is anything like the professor expects. should words be spelled correctly? maybe i should stop correcting typos and keep typing the letters on the keyboard. people are talking to me but i have managed to tune them out, a song is playing somewhere in the distance, or maybe it is right next to me. at this point it makes no difference. i am confused still, a bit baffled, left in stupor. finding the words to describe anything is tough. i visited home over the weekend and realized i didn't miss it too much. i appreciate my family and love them but the thought of a monthly visit home makes me cringe slightly. the blue cable running from my laptop to the resnet connection is coiled up tight yet loose, symbolic of my thoughts. it looks like its organized, but upon closer inspection there is nothing but chaos. few sockets not plugged in, one surge protector shared with my friend. i don't know what else to say. i have some worries about my future, whether or not i chose the right college, and especially whether or not i will have the courage to switch majors if i realize i am in the wrong one. the finish button stares me in the face, tempting me to hit it before the timer hits 20 minutes. 6 to go, i find that i don't really have a stream of consciousness, instead i have very few thoughts, or perhaps they are buried underneath the noise and nonsense i find myself having to sift through right now. occasionally pausing, because the only word i can think of would be a jumble of letters ars opposed to words that make sense. if everyone is having trouble writing this then im okay, but if i ask my friend tomorrow how she handled this and she says it was fun i will be in trouble. this is incredibly hard. am i tracking my feelings or am i tracking observations? what is the difference? philosophy in a 20 minutes stream of consciousness, unabashed, the sentences stopped making sense long ago. 4 minutes give or take. pennebaker is a professor of psychology, enrolled in psy301 i do not know what i should do with 3 minutes of typing. i type faster than i talk. i talk and often my thoughts move faster than my mouth, so that the sounds coming out of my mouth are made up portmanteau words, assemblages like fooding, eated, noteady, meaningless in the end. personally i think that soft drinks taste good, but i can feel them eroding my teeth with intensified sugar collecting around the teeth. science or engineering? i prefer to do the maths because my memory is not so good. business or engineering? i am indecisive, hunger in the belly, thirsty all over. shower and swim, run and jog. nothing to study but people seem to be studying frequently. calculus is different than algebra. too many courses in this college. they should combine them all into one super course.

"how do i feel? well each day is different, sometimes overjoyed with excitement and fullfillment with myself and life. everything seems ok. but very often such as today i feel lonley and unfullfilled and unsatified. i don't lnow if it was because my roomate went out of town for the weekend but the thought of waking up alone gives me a sick empty feelong in my stomach and my heart. i was just thinking the other day why it is that people especilly women ,girls, always like to sleep with stuffed animals? i personaly have never really felt the need to until recently. it is comforting, taking the place of something or someone that is missing from life. i have never been in a serious relationship and i find myself more and more thinking of what it would be like and i often pay attention to other couples or people who appear to be together happily enjoying eachother's company, caressing each other, attentive and sensitive to theother's needs. a special unspoken bond between them. i am jeolous and i don't know why it is that i don't have that. i don't think that i have ever felt this need so strongly before. i am not a very affectianate person. i have never really been. it seems awkward to me to be so, but i feel this untapped very sensitive affectionate part of me that wants to be unleached. i love people so easily. i know that we are flawed with imperfections and sometimes when i see someone as they really are, when there are not hiding behind and image it is easy to love them and see how other's love them and why god loves us. these thoughts make me feel peaceful. but sometimes i am scared that i am over my head, that i see to deep into things. i see corruption, evil that goes to far, in the world and in people. i don't want to be afraid of it because i still believe that good will overcome but it scared me to see that way that society seems to just accept everything, good and bad. i think we should acknowlege it's existence but condemn it as well. it seems so easy just lose yourself in it and i see people do it all the time. it is hard to keep a level head about thing the more you see of them. """" the more you know the less you believe"""" but i want to beleive and i do. yet i cannot ignore what is there. i think that my mother does in a way and she has chosen her point of veiw, a way for her to exist peacefuly in the world and not get lost or confused by it. but to me she seems sheltered and i don't want to live like that. i think i may have a brady bunch family. i believe that i am really lucky. my parents are still together, still in love. they have each other to get through life with. to tell each other that everything is ok and that it is not so bad and that no matter what they are together, and that is enough for them. the rest of the world is irrelevent at times and it is their own creation of a world that they live in. they don't see what they don't want to see and are perfectly content. i am different however and quite alone. i know myself though. at least i have that. i want to take a bigger part in the world than my parents. i want to make an impact on the way we all live. i want to make it better. it's so odd that everyone seems to say that or begins in life beleiveing that they can and so many give up and don't or get lost in what they are trying to help and change, losing sight of the big picture. i am afraid that i will. i don't want to be alone. i get depressed and my energy and motivation sink away from me when i think of trying to do anything on my own. i want to find someone who shares this ideology, someone who will see me as i am and as i will be. i want to grow together with someone. maybe why i haven't had a serious relationship is because i am judging to soon. i always think about why they aren't the one, even before i give them a chance, and i am too picky. i am a walking contradiction. i will turn away anyone who is not the cute big manly type and then i will turn away the cute big manly type because they are too self involved and not sensitive enough or too physical. i can't see to find the right combination. i did find it! i found it and then i lost it. i don't even know what i did really. it was imposible from the beginning and i knew that. he lived five states north. we are in two totally different worlds. i only talked to him on the phone and i knew that i loved him. it makes me teary-eyed to think of what i could have had. i had woanted to see past these limitations and boundaries and make it work and so did he. he was all for it. he inspired me and made me believe that it would work. i beleived in him, in his words, perhaps folishly, naively, and then the bomb dropped. what i had hoped had finally come true only lasted a month and we called it off. the relationship had no where to go but down. i wish i thought about it rationally and protected myself, but i am also glad that i took the risk. i would be the same today without my experiences. i know that but looking back it seemed so obvious the outcome. i set myself right up for a fall. i knew all along that someday we would break up but i didn't know it would be so soon. i thought maybe it could by some miracle last. now i still think of him often. i can't help it. i have never felt the way i do about him for anyone else. i am afraid of getting into another relationship but more i am afraid of caring so much because i think that i have a big heart and it is so easy for me to get attached and to love. i guess that has to do with being young. i don't think it is as easy for people as they get older. i think of this today and i am sad. i don't know if sad is the right word for how i feel because i am not unhappy really just incomplete. i want a fantasy i suppose. i want to meet someone who will see right through me and we can teach each other about each other and become better people. i want him to pick me up and hold me and for me to feel safe and certain that everthing is how it should be. i want him to see only me and make me feel special. i want him to think that he has never met anyone else like me and i am the greatest creature on earth to him and he will be the same to me, and nobody else can compare, nobody of the opposite sex seems as appealing. when our fingertips touch there is a tingling electric sensation, when our eyes meet we see the inner most parts of eachother and the world, the world we create around us. i don't want to be wrong and i don't want outside influences to braek us apart. i want a dream i am smirking at myself the way adults do when the go along with what you say and they are really thinking how niave you are how much more they know and it amuses them the knowing of what you are sure to find out through experience. i hope they are wrong though. i want to beleive that this could happen.

"this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio, texas. i went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell i'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. however, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished. i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order. at first when i went to the co-op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i didn't need about three of them. so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed, and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but i still managed to have a great time. i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home. i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. we went out to eat and to see a movie. we weren't sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. i can't wait for winter time. it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. one of the worst times i've ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and i smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. all together i would have to say that i'm very excited about this year, and i can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life.

" well, all i have to say is that it is very hot in here. the air conditioner is broken, and beads of sweat are trickling from the back of my neck down into my chair. i hate being hot. i would so much rather be cold than hot. however, i could never live in a really cold environment. texas is my home. i would have to kill myself if i lived in michigan or something like that. just imagine, waking up at 6am to go to work, and having your car door frozen shut. that is my hell. i think the perfect place to live would be california, southern florida, or of course hawaii. i am going to be one of those old people who move to the beach when they retire. my husband will have one of those fishing businesses where he takes tourists out for a fish in the ocean, and i get to laze around the pool all day. my grandchildren will come and visit me, because it will be an easy way for their parents to have some time alone, because every kid loves the beach. oh the beach. i love the feeling of the sand through my toes. the salty air running over me, the feeling of the water on my feet. i love the ocean. i wanted to be a marine biologist when i was little, but then i found out i would have to be good at math and science. and that is definitely not me. i do love marine life though. i've been to corpus christi a few times in the last couple of years, and both times i have dragged my boyfriend to the texas state aquarium so i could go and see the animals. especially the sea otters, they're my favorite. i hear the aquarium in monteray, ca has a bunch of sea otters. i would love to go there. i have only been to california once, and that was just for one night before i went to hawaii the next day. what a great state hawaii is. i don't know why the government doesn't pay for a family to travel there once every couple of years to make the stress go away. they do that in france you know. the government (or your insurance) pays for trips to the beach because of it's natural healing powers. america should do that. if we knew we were promised a trip to hawaii every year if we didn't committ any crimes, and we payed our taxes. everyone would comply. there would be no more murders, rapes, robberies, or anything of the sort. and if anyone is ever pissed off at the government for anything. well it will all be forgotten after a couple of strawberry daqueries at a swim-up bar in a 5-star hotel over-looking the pacific. they say that having an aquarium releases tension, well just imagine going out on the ocean and seeing dolphins jump next to you on the boat, and whales splashing their tales. that'll do you good for 10 years! god i need a vacation. just a little weekend one will do fine. maybe just to san antonio, or back down to the coast. hell i'll even settle for home--free meals and shopping in fort worth might cure some ailment. but i am pretty sure that the beach is my best bet. the best is late at night on the water. the stars and moon reflect off of the ocean, and everything is still except for the sound of the pulsing waves and the cooling breeze. i think i'll start packing my bag now. damn, i don't have a swim suit. i'll stop at target on the way out.

" well, yesterday was a good day, that is until i spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. i guess i was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing. i was mad at him and then hung up with him, then i called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him. it was just one big drama over nothing. i guess i made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean. that ofcourse made me sad, because all i wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him. he is attending college at texas state, the big party school, and i guess i'm just scared i'm going to lose him. he's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up. although i haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling i've felt in such a long time. it makes me sad because i'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last. i've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more i think about it, the more i worry. maybe that's why i was being rude to him. my fears just come out in other ways. it's so strange though because i know i can see him pretty much every weekend. i'm just so confused right now. maybe i'm just stressed. it is my first year of college and i'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors. i just want everything to be okay. i want good grades. i want to have fun. and most of all i want to work things out with my boyfriend. i felt like crying when i got off the phone with him last night, but i held back because i didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong. when i think of my boyfriend i can only think of a future with him. i've known him a lot longer than i've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me. i know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break. i'm only 18. what are the odds of he and i actually getting married, honestly? then it makes me think why i even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? there really is no point. on the other hand, i need to be with this boy. life just wouldn't be the same without him. what to do? maybe i'll just propose to him. haha, yeah right. i just want things to be okay. i just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons i am. grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense. anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful. got some of my feelings out, and i've never said any of this stuff to anyone. it was like a journal. i'm glad i'm taking such a cool class.

"well this is the first writing assignment of the semester. you had said in our first meeting that we could write out a rough draft before we submitted this copy to you. i figured that since this is a stream of consciousness writing that it would be best if this were written straight to you without proofreading or rewriting. well today i got back from visiting home for the labor day weekend, i'm feeling really homesick right about now, i think it's even worse than when i first left home for the first time to move to ut. but i'm sure as the week goes on, i'll adjust again. i think that as the year progresses and i visit more often, the coming back to school when the weekend is over will get a lot easier, because it will become i routine type of thing. have you noticed that i've started all the paragraphs, with the exception of this one, with the word """"well""""? i think that's a word i use to start off thoughts that i don't know how to start off. i don't know if that's good or bad, but who really cares, right? this isn't rhetoric. the first football game is this coming weekend, my first longhorn football game ever. of course i've seen games on tv, but being at the game is always better and more exciting. just the like the san antonio spurs, i always watch them on tv, but being at the game is so much fun. i just learned this weekend that someone from my graduating class is in my psychology class. this isn't a person that i ever talked to, in fact, i never even knew who he was until a good friend of mine started dating him. i'm guessing he saw me in the class when we first met last thursday, i didn't see him though, as you know, there are 540 people in that class. last night as i was falling asleep, i started thinking about the homework that i need to get done. then i started thinking about this writing assignment. i couldn't fall asleep because i couldn't remember when this assignment was due. in my head i continuously thought, """"is it due the 15th or the 5th?"""" of course, i've always been this way, i always seem to contradict myself. in elementary school, i would lay awake at night trying to remember if i had finished all the work that was assigned to me. i would literally get up every night to check my backpack to make sure it was all finished and that i had put it all into my bag for the next day. i have a feeling i'm going to be this way in college, my biggest fear is failing. i know that if i work hard, i won't, but i can't help feel this way. wow, has it been 20 minutes already, yes it has. i got a class in 20 minutes. this was fun, got to go.

" i sure am glad to get this out of the way. i really enjoy all of my new classes but by math professor is really hard to understand. i miss jenny so much and ca not wait until this weekend when i get to see her. this typing stuff and i don't get along very well but that's why i have voice activated word processor. i talk and it types everything that i pronounce. i really don't think that fifteen hours on the first semester of school was a very good idea. i have absolutely no free time. i have phl, psy and rhe so i am reading all the time. at least i have a few good friends in most of my classes. i need to get my head back in school though because right now it is still in summer. all the information i receive in lectures simply goes in one ear and out the other. i hope my mom is doing better. i left her alone all by herself when i moved to college. wow, this is a really elementary level paragraph, ehh, o well. so i wonder if its true that guys can blank out and be thinking about nothing, no literally nothing and girls always have thoughts flying through their heads. if it's true the girls papers should be some what longer than the guys unless of course the girl cannot type very well (like me). i really wish i could decide on a major soon but if not i know everything will be just fine. the only thing i would like to have more of is free time. i have no free time to get my mind off of the books. hopefully that will come soon. i'm getting pretty tired of riding the capital metro to and from school i really need to see about a dorm room for next semester but for sure next year. i feel like i am writing diary or something, actually it's quite relaxing and stress relieving. i need to see about going to my chem. and math's professor's office hours. well i'm thinking so hard on what to write about that i am drawing a blank, i think its the small amount of sleep i have been acquiring. i wonder if my cars ac will be fixed tomorrow like they said but then again they said it would be today and i'm still with out a car. it's very hard not to use im language on this and abbreviate everything. by the way i suck at spelling so sorry if anyone reads this other than me. i wonder what all the goop is inside my lava lamp is made of? i don't know but i do know that my chem. professor wouldn't know because he have a hard enough time trying to teach my class of 500 the chemistry basics. sweet it's already over, man that was fast, too bad it's not like that in class.

"i don't like icebreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. i won a huge pack of icebreaker's gum from pro grad and i now feel obligated to make use of it even though i dislike it. i do that a lot. i eat foods that i don't really like just to make my mom happy. it is not really a big deal. i usually tell people what i like and what i dislike, but sometimes i don't. my grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and i don't like coconut, but i use to eat it anyway. one day i just stopped and she didn't really notice. i was like, """"man i could have stopped a long time ago, but instead i didn't. """" okay that makes no sense, but i do not always make sense. my mind jumps from thing to thing, and i digress a lot. i get off track often. love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. to me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. i cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. i can get deep and all emotional when i feel the moment calls for it, but right now i am just not really in a """"deep"""" mood. i still have to read my chemistry and read my cyberreader for my cyberpunk class. why am i taking a cyberpunk class? i have no idea. i like to try and experience new things so i decided to take it. actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. i love to be happy. i hate to be sick. i love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when i am sick. the water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. i don't want to do my reading assignments. i want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. i want to go see """"the cell"""" with jennifer lopez and vince vaughn. i can be such a teenager sometimes. i do some of the most immature and silly things. i can fall all over myself when i see a cute boy band, and i can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. clay walker, a country singer, has a song called """"ordinary people"""". it is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. it talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. the great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. i can't imagine being photographed all the time. i don't look good in photos when i am posing, so you can only imagine how awful i would look in ones where i do not pose. i sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. you all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that i have selfconfidence issues. i can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. i like being short. i like that people view me as cute just because i am short. being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. i just like the idea of the guy being tall. my boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because i look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason i think that makes us look cuter. why do they call the prestage room the green room? the green room is often not even green. i don't understand that. i don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. except of course for in way west texas where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. i hate people who are hypocrites. i think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. i wish i was smarter. i wish i could sing. that would be a great talent just because i like to sing. two minutes to go! i can't help but look at the clock. i am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages i have to read. i am very impatient, but i am patient when i feel it is necessary. times out! the end!

" ok im sitting on my bed. i kind of wish i was at home on my bed. i like my new room a lot, and i like my new bed a lot but i miss home. i am not sad here but i just miss my old way of life and my old setting. i wish i could go back to elementary school. those were the good old days. i love my old neighborhood. i definitely want to send my kids to my elementary school. i miss the scots football games the most. i have been going to them since 5th grade, maybe? i love the atmosphere. everyone is happy and excited it is friday and you get to talk to everyone and its so fun! i like watching my friends play football and the feeling after we won. after i made belles, the scots games became even more fun. i can't explain that feeling, waiting to line up and dance on the field. you are so nervous and anxious and shaking. then the lieutenants bow and you scream for them and then the music starts. we strut out and its such an out-of-body experience. you are standing before thousands of people, and you are smiling so big and bright. not because you have to, but because you want to and you can't help it. i don't think its possible to not smile. then you get ready to dance. and you start dancing and its the best feeling in the world. you feel so weird. and you don't want to mess up. and when the music stops you are so proud. of yourself and of your team. and you stand up and strut out towards the crowd and all the fans are standing and cheering and clapping and smiling and you can't help but smile too. because all the parents are truly amazed. and all the little girls, the little girls that you used to be, are staring at you in awe. they want to be you so badly. because everyone in the community looks up to you. and you represent so much positive energy in the community. and the little boys want your autograph. and they want to date you when they're in high school. you feel like a celebrity. its your moment to shine. your fifteen minutes of fame. its ineffable. i can't describe the feeling, but its the best. i miss those days so much. i would give anything to go back to that. but i cant, and thats what kills me. i can't wait to go back to the scots game in a few weeks. it will be so weird to see my younger friends dancing. to my favorite dance ever. to my first dance on the field. it was the best dance anyone had seen. and the sad thing is, i won't be a part of it. it will be one of those bittersweet moments. i love those moments. i live for those moments. they make you so happy and so sad at the same time. it makes me so happy to reminisce in my favorite days. i don't know how i will feel when i go back to that stadium because it will be so different. most of my friends will be gone. i like my new lifestyle in college. its fine. but i loved what i had. i don't like getting older. im fine with where i was. i feel like my life is going by so fast. i feel like my best days are behind me. i can't believe how fast high school went by. if i could, i would go back and do it all over again. exactly the same way. i would make the same mistakes and everything. just to relive those incredible four years. they werent always fun, but it was a good experience. instead of reliving them, i would like to just watch it all on video. watch everything i've ever done. i miss camp too. i learned everything about life at camp. it makes me so sad to think im not a camper anymore. thats how i know im old. thats how i know my life is going by so fast. camp is pure happiness. all of my favorite things in life are behind me and i don't know what to do about it. i am really enjoying school here. like the classes itself are so interesting and im really enjoying them. but the work is becoming overwhelming. and i don't like going out at night. i don't like socializing with superficial people. i feel surrounded by sin. by people who only care about being cool or something. i just love the days when everyone was innocent. and it didnt matter what you did on the weekend. it didnt matter who your friends were as long as you were happy with them. everyone was nice. and on friday nights we would eat dinner at jacks and then go to the scots game. when everything was perfect. and you didnt worry about anything. seriously, stress wasnt an issue. school work was nothing because it was so easy. everything was done for you. you went to soccer practice and you went to school. that was it. it was so simple. did i realize that then? did i thoroughly enjoy it while i was there? or do i just love it looking back on it? i don't know why i like living in the past. but i enjoy dwelling in it. it makes me happy and sad at the same time. my best friend is the same way. she is the best person i know. i don't know how i will survive the next four years without her physically by my side everyday. she is the only person that fully understands me because she is me. she feels the same way. and how many times have we talked about these good old days? the elementary school that we loved so much and the scots games that were the highlight of our weekend. every chance we got. and i could do it again and again with her. even if we repeated the same words. just as long as i got to relive it for those few minutes. i can't believe life in my community is going on without me. i know my home is much quieter now. and i know my mom is longing for the days she walked me to elementary school, probably as much as i am. i wonder if when i leave college in four years ill be longing to go back to the beginning. should i be spending these moments living in the excitement because soon these will be the good old days? i can't see how they are. i like my dorm a lot. i can smell all these flowers. i can't believe im a pi phi. thats how i know im old. if i had chosen anything else, i would be denying my past. my mom is a part of me so thats why i chose what i chose. i have been waiting to be a pi phi for as long as i can remember. only i assumed i would be at smu. did i choose the right school? i didnt really choose because i wasnt ready to go and i don't think im ready to be here ",0

"i just ate and am full. i feel a little stressed trying to write in a flow and finding enough things to write for 20 mins. this is probably one of the strangest things i've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting i'm so excited to major in it. i'm having a bad morning, because i slept late and now i feel that my whole day is ruined. it's so weird to be doing homework like this, i guess i'm just not used to this. i'm so glad this class is so different. i also love philosophy too. i really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. this is such a pivotal moment in my life, as i embark on college life. right now i'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. i feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as i click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. i'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and riana keeps talking on the phone. i get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. right now i'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and i cannot concentrate. she's always with him, and i can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and i'm sad because were growing apart, and i can't stop it from happening, and i'd really like to. he's so perfect, but i'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because i love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing i want to do is hurt him, so i may just lay a passive role in the relationship until i can settle things in my mind. i feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. i have so many confusions and distractions here. my friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. i loved this guy as a friend, but i've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. i got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing i was upset about was the fact that i have to ruin a saturday in defensive driving. this assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. i'm really worried that when i finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because i accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done. my very first assignment , and i've probably already messed it up. i guess i'll have to explain the problem to the professor, and hope he understands that i've never used the internet before, and i am an idiot for messing up. well i guess i'll end on this paranoid note, because i really want to do well, and make a 4. 0 this semester. no one believes me, but i have high hopes and determination, and i won't let them bring me down. well i guess i didn't end on such a bad note after all, but if that's what you need to make it, then i guess i'll end up ok after all ",1

"ok. stream of. """"come as you are. i wonder if anybody actually misses kurt cobain. """"no i don't have a gun""""? what? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named nirvana, whose leader shot himself. blues traveler, much better group. i wonder how many people have killed themselves because of kurt cobains death. that takes intelligence. kurt's dead, life's not worth living. why did i wait till the day before this is due to type it. ohhhhhh i love this song. it reminds me of my boyfriend and i. """"when she says she loves me"""". except i don't say i love him because according to every one of my friends i'm afraid to tell him i love him. something about a fear of commitment and love. i guess it's all supposed to be nathan's fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. """" when she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love"""". good song. i wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. oh yah, classic sting. i have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. i never really liked sting anyway. i should really be doing my other homework. what do i have to do? english paper, read my classic civilization, read my english, study psy notes, and phl notes. i guess i can do most of it tomorrow. third eye blind. where do they get names for these groups? tomorrow is another day{go scarlett}. i really don't want to go to work tomorrow. at least i have a decent boss for once, not some 57 year old pervert. what time is it? wow 15 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. i wish they were all that easy. yah right. that probably wouldn't get me into med school. medical school, four more years of college. hopefully i can get through these first four. i can do it, because i'm good enough i'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. well it's been a great 14 min. i'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. i need to do these more than a day before their due next time.

"not as much concentration, nor as deep a thought. i have always had a problem with being too easily distracted - like now i just lost my train of thought. i try to think about too many things at once and i do not really have a choice about what i think. when i was doin the pretesting i often found that if any question required any thought or recoolection at all i was drawn a blank at it. i simply could not look deeply into what i saw. i have related this problem to many possible sources - this is why i decided that i did not want to smoke marijuana. it is also why i am thinking that i should not smoke. it is possible that smoking could have a depressive effect on the mind. maybe i do not drink enough water, or sleep too little or too much. there really is no way to know for certain. i should probably just lead the best life that i know how instead of the easiest, which is what i do. i know there are things i need to get done, things that i do which are just wasting my time, and things that i know are just plain wrong but i always reason my way around these issues. or rather i just stop myself from thinking about them. it really cannot be good to be like this - i am feeling like i inhaled a little too much glue - actually i am probably just using the computer too much. by continuously focusing on an external source of entertainment right in front of me i feel that i am rotting my brain. this assignment is not helping either because i am not allowed to stop and think about things - once again i am simply functioning on the basest level possible. i like the movie the stand a lot, and i have read the entire book once and the first half two more times. i never really can finish it, but this last time that was because i decided that reading was bad for me. in all honesty, it is probably better for me thatn enything else i do because it might encourage deep thought. i should probably also listen to music without words - one is forced to think deeply with that because there is nothing else really for your mind to do. i listen to the play les miserables all the time now - and it is interesting because it is a very sad play - in a way it makes me sadder than anything. i feel like i would cry if i would ever cry, but i never do. i cry maybe once every year or two, and it is usually for something silly. the last time i cried sincerely was when highschool ended i had just listened to i will remember you, the sound they played at graduation. i also saw grease and st. elmo's fire, both of which remind me of high school. soon after i cried quite a bit over the loss of something which i didn't really care about in the first place. i think it is because i have never liked the end of anything, and the end of highschool is much like the end of the first section of you life. although there is a marginal change from elementary to junior high, and junior high to high school, they are still organized schools in the public school system, often ever within the same school district. every day at 7 am you get up to prepare for school which you are required to go to at 8. there are tardies and classes and a bell and teachers that know your name. lunch is in a cafeteria at a specific time and there is a meal of the day that you must pay your 1. 50 or 1. 75 for. it is really all the same thing, just twelve different grades in the same school. college is more like a job than like the old school system - it is a huge change. i simply hope that my friends don't go crazy and decide to move off or something after college. this would be the death of me because i will not, can not, and don't want to make new friends. however, i have found that no contact with friends slowly drives me mad. i would love for me jere and nolan and robert to stay local forever. i would like them all to, but i do not see how i could live without at least (robert and nolan), (jeremy and robert), (mark and robert), (robert and ben), (jeremy and ben), (jeremy and mark). therse combinations would be able to keep me satisfied for just about forever. of course, you know the freakin psychos will all go off and get married like the sick bastards that they are. they should read a little bit of saint paul, the fools. he knew the wisdom about not getting married. that was one of the things that pissed me off about your pretest. it asked is my shyness interfered with my dating or something like that. no, my shyness doesn't interfere with my freaking dating, cause i don't date! i never will date, i barely ever have dated, and i think that people who do date should be lined up and flogged until they come to their senses. in my junior year people always used to say, well craig, you are just bitter cause you can't get any. well, at the time that was partially true, but since then i have had opportunity galore. in my senior year, jana (the cheer leader), heather, myriah, jill, and melissa all openly admitted that they liked me. did i pursue? did i? well, i admit i foolishly wen out with jana (worst mistake of my life, btw). but no one can say that i can't get any. no sir. there was a girl on my floor last year that may have liked me (the only girl i have bothered to meet in all of college so far). peopl also say well just wait until you meet the right person craig - then you will change your mind. well who are they kidding? i already said that i had no interest in meeting any people at all. i have met basically zero peopl since i have been in college. i met my roommate, and i briefly spoke to nero and christina (i think that was her name) but that is it. i have met no one in my classes nor do i have any remote interest in meeting them. once last year a girl called me up to ask me to study with her (highly possible that she was interested in me as well) but i had no interest in doing so. i sat there in terror hoping that she wouldn't ask me to study with her, for i would have to turn her down which i hate to do. that will probably how i will end up getting hitched. i just won't be able to say no. i am terrible at that.

"well this really pisses me off. i write you assignment to send to you but i get no connection. so i save it and try to do send it again. it got lost, even worse i have to do this again just turn this stupid thing in. for something i have already did, this really pissed me off. so to make sure you get this thing i'm thinking about emailing this to you. and to think i actually did truly analyze myself for this project, tell you my true feelings and you don't even get to see it. this is what is really going in my sub- consciousness. you well probably are not going to get a memo like this class. too bad, i really had a great paper or memo you could have really thought about. it was about time, and since i have to do this the second time, it's even hardier to write about. speaking of time i have about 5 minutes left so here it goes. i feel that time is one of the most under-rated things in this world today. just look at me i'm writing this memo for the second time today and have to do the other one tomorrow. now that was a lot of stress for just one day. still i accomplish more things under pressure, i think that is what i'm best at. well it is time for me to depart, so i hope i well learned something in your class. man, this really is stress releasing.

"okay, i've begun writing. one thing i should probably point out as i recall the above statement about disregarding grammar is that i spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as i type are second nature to me, so it's not like i've gone back and fixed all the errors. which doesn't mean that there probably aren't any run on sentences in here. okay. that's been said. right now my roommate is being fairly loud. i find that bothersome. i'm not sure if he's stupid or inconsiderate. i'd rather be at home right now. i was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now i'm having trouble getting the motivation to do anything. it made the summer more fun at the time, but it was maybe not such a good idea. ideas are like that because of that whole 20'20 hindsight thing. i'm looking at the vents on the side of my computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gills. i'm not looking forward to having to do the other writing assignment. which is not to say i think it'll be difficult, but this assignment requires almost no discipline. the other one will require me to have directed thought, and that's not really that big a deal, but it's one thing to sit down ready to do a task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long you're supposed to be doing it. what i mean to say is that the time will seem to pass more slowly because i'll be watching the clock, so i'll probably be more bored, and i don't like to be bored. i'm not very far into this but my train of thought seems to have stopped. probably because my roommate(or actually suitemate; i have a room to myself but share a refrigerator, microwave and two bathrooms with two other guys)keeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly. it wouldn't be so bad if he'd just shut his door, but for some reason he hasn't thought of that. they've wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of my door now. now they seem to have left, so maybe i can concentrate. no, that didn't work. i've found it previously difficult to make my mind blank intentionally, but now it seems to come quite easily. i think probably i'm tired. the cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at my home, so when there's nothing else to do i usually watch something like comedy central late at night and shave a few hours off of a healthy amount of sleep. that's better; time's passing quickly now. which i normally wouldn't like, but this is something i wouldn't have done if it wasn't a grade(no offense to anyone involved in this research)and when you're forced to do something you want it to end quickly. i think the air conditioning in this dorm is screwed up. it's hot right now, and i had to buy a fan earlier to keep it semi-cool in my room. it doesn't work all the time. like right now. the fan's blowing on me, but i'm not cool. there he goes again. i think my roommate's playing 'sympathy for the devil' now. which isn't so bad, because that's a good song. i tried to learn the piano once, but i didn't stay on it for very long. i found that the teacher was really good for nothing, because i could learn everything she taught from the book itself. but when i stopped going to lessons i found too many other things to occupy my time, and stopped practicing. i would have liked to have been able to play the keyboard parts in several rolling stones songs. and several other of the 'older' bands' songs. most modern music is pretty much no good. and that brings an end to my twenty minutes.

"right now i am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. in my language of the stage class my teacher gave my about 60 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this friday. it has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 17 pages. i don't know how i am going to read the rest. i am almost thinking that i should just not do it but if i did that i would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. so i think that i am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. i just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. that is a lot of work. now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. i was so excited because i haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. i am so upset because i really wanted to see her. she is going back home to see her family instead. i know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but i really wanted her here because i know that we would have had so much fun together and i wanted her to meet all of my friends. oh well, i know that she will come to see me soon i hope. well so far i have had a really good time here at school. i have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. the only problem is that i have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. it's like i wnat to make good grades in school but i also want to go out and meet new people. i am also a pi phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. i really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. i also need to start working out again because i don't want to gain weight and i am really afraid about that. i also want to work out just so that i feel good about myself and feel like i have done something productive for the day. i hate feeling like a slob and that is what i have felt like lately. well i am having so much fun but i really miss my friends that aren't here. only a couple of my friends are here but i enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already.

"i even went to summer school here in the preview program and i still find myself in amazement sometimes. i am adjusting well-- a great deal better than my mom. that could be because college is something i knew i had to do and the university of texas at austin has always been the place i wanted to be. my classes are okay. i have a sort of messed up schedule. i really cannot complain. tuesdays are the only days that totally messes with my mind. i cannot seem to get signed up for a research experiment in mezos. i have went by a numerous amount of times. i like to get things done ahead of time. i am just now doing this because the lab is always full. i am too lazy to go to the one at my apartment complex and when i came to the lab yesterday i totally messed up on the waiting list procedure. when it asked for your name, i put in my name instead of my if account. so i couldn't log in and it assigned my computer to someone else. when i used the lab over the summer i never had to get on a waiting list, so i did not know. i did get quite embarrassed though. i did it right today. but i guess i did not anticipate doing so, i did not bring a disk. as far as i can tell though i don't need one to complete this assignment. so let's see, school is doing fine. i am having roommate trouble a little bit. i live off-campus and i have 3 roommates. well, 3 of us get along fine. but one attends acc and she is 17 years old (boy, does she act it). well, that is the only thing that is bothering me. i am stuck with her for a year. she lied to get in our apartment and now we are stuck with her. oh well. in my philosophy class, which i just left by the way, professor martinich is so interesting. he wrote two of our textbooks. he' s real perceptive and insightful. i am taking philosophy of religion. there are about 150-200 people in the class, so we have si groups. i hate my si. we are supposed to discuss and we actually get graded for it. but, i don't fell comfortable doing so. i love to talk and i have plenty of opinions, so that's bothering me. the only thing i can come up with is that when talking about a thing like religion everyone comes into the discussion with strong opinions. like last week, we basically argued. i made a comment and they looked at me like,"""" boy is she stupid. """" i don't like that. even the ta acts like he has his own views and those that are against the grain aren't worth listening to. he questions your comment and accepts others. i don't know. i am thinking about talking to dr. martinich. i guess i'll give it one more try. that was just the first one. i shouldn't get counted off for being in an uncomfortable environment.

" i thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. actually, i kind of like it. it's kind of like writing a diary or journal. i feel hungry right now and am wondering what i am going to eat for lunch. i am tired of eating the same food at jester again. the food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. i can't wait until i go home to dallas this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. i miss my mom's cooking. just a few more hours and i'll be on my way back to dallas. i can't wait! i miss my boyfriend so much. his birthday's coming up and i still need to get him a present. i don't know what to get him. it's hard for me because i don't have a car at ut. i wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. my friend just burned a new dj cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. i miss my family. its funny how when i'm at home i wish that i was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when i'm actually away i wish i was home. my roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. he calls her a lot. it's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. ' he would call me all the time. my friends are studying in my dorm right now. i feel so lazy. i'm behind in a lot of classes and i havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. i need to push myself to study before i screw up my gpa again. speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and i wish that it would over. i mean i like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. i just hate classes and studying. my friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. its so funny. by the way the dj cd that we burned is called dj prada g. it's like the dj is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. hmmm. twenty minutes sure is going by slow. i have an ortho appointment this monday so i'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because i can borrow the notes from my friend. i need to go shopping this weekend; i am so out of clothes to wear. five more minutes. this assignment isn't too bad. when are we going to eat? i need to start packing. i am such a procrastinator, i wait till the last minute for everything. i need to stop that. i wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. i have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. we are about to leave for dallas soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. when are we going to eat?

"i am sitting here wondering as to why i chose to do this assignment at this particular time. as i search my the thoughts the number one reason i can find is boredom. i am so bored right now, as i have throughout my entire ut experience. i miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. i have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but i feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that i have become accustomed to over the past 18 years. i'm pretty sure that i just used a runon sentence. five minutes down, fifteen to go. notice that i spelled out the words """"five"""" and """"fifteen"""" in order to waste. i am wasting this time because i don't feel any need to be introspective. i feel that i know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, i that i have no need to further analyze my thoughts. i am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. i'm sure that my high school english teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences i started with """"i"""". although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word """"saw"""". did you notice that i also spelled out the word eight. it has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. i hope that this writing is still here when i come back. i'm back. that took about a minute. sorry. i meant to right one minute. i wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. i wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? i wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? i feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. i feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. as this assignment comes to an end i wonder what i was supposed to have learned, for i feel that i am none the wiser. twenty minutes have now passed. the end.

"what is my problem? i have got to be the biggest bum on the planet. does that mean i have some kind of psychoanalytical problem? i don't know about complexes and childhood mistakes but i do know that there is really something disturbingly lazy about my attitude towards things. what kind of person could put his entire future on the line by not taking care of his college responsibilities? i am that kind of person. i'll probably drop out of college or something and what's even worse is that i see the problem staring me right in my face but i am either to lazy or to apathetic to change my situation. maybe i am a combination of both. honestly, what will my parents say? well, my dad will probably be relieved that i came back home to him. not in the way most families would be relieved though. he would just have another speech to hang over my head after every other mistake i may make in the future. he will probably totally dominate on me like he used to back in the day. he literally did not care about how you felt. maybe that is not quite accurate. i am convinced that he cared about people, and he cared about the family structure as a whole, however his total control over everyone in the house was clear and unbinding. he probably would have defended us with his life, i am sure of it. it is ironic; he would die for us but he wouldn't compromise with us to save his life. compromise? never! god forbid! i know it cannot be that hard to prioritize. wait a minute. how funny is that? i of all people have no business trying to tell someone to prioritize especially when it will be a god sent miracle if i turn in all my assignments this semester. but maybe, just maybe i have stumbled on to something here. i mean, well, what is the point i am trying to make? maybe i recognize similarities between my persona and the people i have associated myself with over the years. duh that's a no brainer. but it is interesting the way one can tell. with my friends it is very, very easy to see that we all talk and act and think alike. sometimes we deliberately change ourselves to fit the mold. with people you dislike it is very different though isn't it? it seems that what we see in them we hardly see at all. i can feel, if almost by instinct, that he and i have some very serious related issues, however one doesn't just stumble over them in his summation of the days events. a person has to be writing on a day very much like today, working on an assignment, very much like this one, following his """"stream of consciousness. """" whatever that means is almost beside the point as far as i am concerned. maybe this is like a journal or something. maybe i should start writing a journal or something. i can be like """"captain james t. kirk"""" writing his """"captains log. """" wow. how did i get so off track? all i know is that i started this thing at twelve sixteenpm which means that in another minute i will be able to stop writing about my pitiful mental concepts. i'll probably drop off in mid sentence or something ",0
"i just wasted over an hour and a half trying to get my stupid ethernet card to work. the worst part is that i waited over four weeks for this stupid thing to come in and now none of the drivers and software recognize it. i think it is royally <blank>. now i have to waste another two hours talking to technical support so they can take the thing back. what a rip. this makes this day a really big let down, considering i complained to my parents about getting this thing up here for me. i could have been doing some of the hundreds of hours of homework that i have to do. this day has been really wasted. every day is a waste. all i do is homework each day and nothing more or less. occasionally i get to watch half an hour of television or go to the union or go play a few video games, but lately, it seems that every class wants me to spend a few hours each night working on their assignments. i haven't even had time to look around the austin area. i haven't seen a movie in a while either. this place really sucks. i don't do anything really interesting. i have no life. now i'm complaining too much and being self-conscious. i couldn't even read my notes on that example. he talks too fast for people to keep up. psychology sounds pretty cool. the breeze never hits austin. it's like it is always hot and the sun never goes away. maybe one day it will turn into fall in this town and finally it's be relatively cool so i don't marinate in my own juices. yeah, i know it sounds gross, but what would you call it? i take a shower, walk to kinsolving, when i get there, i'm tired and need to take a shower, and i sure do work up an appetite. it's the way back that is a killer. by the time you get back to moore hill, you feel like rolling over and dying because of your full stomach, the supersaturated shirt and the fatigued feet. i need to jog more. it seems like i'll never have time. i never have time to do any of my old hobbies. for crying out loud, i can't even get y network card to install onto my notebook. i wish i had time to do my old hobbies, like photography. i could have and should have majored in photography. maybe i should major is psychology. it's a really interesting class and i kind of like it i wish they served more than three flavors of ice-cream. it's like that chicken. 'today for dinner, roasted chicken. for lunch it'll be chicken dumplings, tomorrow it'll be chicken soup. then creamy chicken blank. tomorrow it is chicken patties, the next day it is chicken nuggets, the next day they'll run out of chicken and serve chicken fried steak with chicken gravy for the steak and mashed potatoes' it's repulsive what they serve us. maybe i should reduce my meal plan. better check in the morning. i still have another few minutes. my roommate is asking about cyanide. i guess that's what happens when your girlfriend dumps you. tough break. he's been really depressed. he's been like this all evening. i wonder what i'll do tomorrow. i better get a plan together for what needs to be done. hmmm. i wish i could get my net access. now i'm pissed.

"well, to begin with i am simply thinking that i don't think i can type for 20 minutes without my fingers cramping up. but that is ok i suppose since i doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students, i don't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts. confusion is a funny thing. it comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often. at least i think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often. even when you know exactly what to do, sometimes you can get confused because you don't want to do what you are supposed to. sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. (in a manner of speaking) i am thinking that i am tired of writing about confusion. it's kind of like thinking about thinking. i heard that it is bad for you to do that. i think it destroys brain cells. but then again, a lot of things destroy brain cells. drugs destroy brain cells. i don't do drugs because i don't think i have very many brain cells to spare. wow, only 5 minutes have passed! that is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and i don't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and i am taking no chances with that kind of stuff. i know how sneaky teachers can be. i know how sneaky students can be. some chick was all cheating on out math quiz today. i don't know who she was, but she was just flipping through her notes. the teacher had no clue. he was too busy daydreaming. i could have cheated also, but i don't like to cheat. i think that if my best isn't good enough for the professors at ut, then too bad, i'll go to community college. i would rather have a degree from acc that i earned than one from ut that i cheated my way to getting. i think most people would agree with me but who knows! i tend to think that people are good. but that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once. take for instance my good friend tiffany. yes, good ol' tiffany. i loved her to death. we were really good friends. we did everything together. then one day i found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend, john. that was quite a shock to me. i was so depressed. i didn't even want to get out of bed. i did, but it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do. i was really very in love with him and i thought that he was in love with me too. i guess that is just one example of how stupid i am. so i guess i learned from my experience. people aren't as good as you would want them to be. but then again maybe i didn't learn jack. because the next guy i went out with was a jerk too. well, he actually was a decent guy. at least that is what i said to everyone when they told me he was a """"player"""". oh gosh i still have 7 more minutes. well anyways, they told me he was a player but he said that he thought i was the most beautiful person he had ever met, inside and out. that was it, i was hooked. that is all i have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that i was special. he made me feel pretty and he told me i had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person. i loved hearing him say that. i was willing to risk everything. i even compromised my friendship with my roomate. see, she said they were just friends, and so did he, but then when him and i went out for the first time, she was very pist off. i didn't know why, but it became a suspicion of mine that she secretly liked him. i asked her about it, and she denied it. but i still to this day do not know what to think about her liking him. i mean, she did encourage me an unususal amount to break up with him. not that it would do her any good because he really would never go out with her. but still, i wonder sometimes if she ever did like him. she is a strong willed person and i thought that she would just come clean and admit it if she did. but the thing about strong people is that most of the time they are often weak. they are just good actors and can hide it better than the rest of us. i think all humans can have the same amount of strenghth. i think that if you just pretend to be strong, then everyone will think you are strong. it is from this facade that you can draw strenght. take for instance omar. i act like i don't care about him at all when really i still care for him a lot. now, since everyone thinks i am strong i just pretend that i don't care about him and it helps me to deal with it when we are around each other. i guess i kind of slipped the other day when i got drunk and called him on the telephone at 4:00 in the morning. hey, i hope nobody reads this because this is some embarassing stuff and i really don't think that anyone should know about my loser life except for me and the power macintosh. ok well i am pretty much done now. i guess that wasn't so hard after all. i hope the next assignment is this easy. not that my hands aren't going to cramp up when i finally press submit. ok, i'm done.

"roommates are playing music very loudly. although, this music is good blues unlike the top 40 crap that normally comes blaring out of their speakers. my roommate is on the phone with a friend complaining about his classes, assignments, his teachers, and the other usual complaint. in the back of my mind i am a bit nervous about the paper i have to write for my rhetoric 306 class. procrastination was a big problem of mine throughout high school. for a change, i wrote a page of the paper last night. however, i am not sure of the quality but nevertheless it is only a first draft and i just need to turn it in on time. bing! bang boom! i hope i see this girl named melissa at the delta gamma mixer tonight. i can't believe she lived in my hometown of kansas city for two years. it's a small world after all. it's a small, small world. bought printer paper today. need to call my brother. need to email my english teacher. so many things so little time. oh well, keep on keeping on. i wonder why my brother brent has not emailed me back. i wonder where he is? did he leave seattle? who knows? blankness washing over me. who, who, who let, who let who who who let them dawgs out? whistling in the hall. shut up! you are annoying me and taking over my stream of consciousness, but i guess it doesn't really matter what goes through the stream because the whole idea is just to type what is going through the mind. what is going through the mind? tired? no, not particularly. back is getting a little stiff though. count backwards from 150 by seven and see if stress level goes up. sickness. i was sick last week. coughing coughing coughing. runny nose, headache, ears hurt, throat hurt. aaaagghh! maggie. i miss my baby girl. she is a one year old poodle who i spent my entire summer with because of my broken leg. i miss her. i think she misses me. i hope she misses me. she has been sleeping on my bed. i hope she doesn't think i have abandoned her. whistling. boy, these guys are loud. two days after a workout is when you are at your peak soreness. full hour late for class. oh boy, i am repeating the words of the guy that just walked into my room. daily texan. something about the daily texan. forever and ever amen. blankness blank man starring damon wayans was a really bad movie. pure crap! soreness. i feel soreness too. my neck. huge! wow! neat! ok ok my printer is working pretty well. printed off a bunch of stuff for biology. three minutes left. copies. copies. who let the dawgs out? this tune has become the anthem of the hall. one side actually likes the piece of rubbish. the other side plays it as a joke. forever and ever amen. ben folds five ",0
"start. the question is how can i make a good grade in this class? most people are smarter than me so i have to try harder to make a better grade. i know nothing, that is all i know. i don't know what to say when i see a stranger so i do not speak. frustrated. confused. tired. lucky. healthy. homesick. lonely. but its all good ill be alright tomorrow right? fuck you big country you bitch. there are so many new people here its overwhelming. i am mute. i want to make friends but i do nothing. stupid. harmless. harmful. nice. relaxed. worked out. bored. nothing really to say to mom and dad just what i did today. can't talk about some of the other things because there is no need for them to be burdened by my troubles. but they would like to hear it anyways. maybe i will try talking to them. am i crazy? i hope so. its so much more fun to be crazy. like in catch22, which i just finished reading. its really interesting to mess with people the way yosarrian did. i miss paris. i love it and hate it but love it more than hate. everyone is connected to everything else. especially in paris. i don't know anything right? because i am from paris? i'm so sick and tired of people from houston, dallas, austin, san antonio trying to make me feel inferior and they know everything so much better than i do. but i come from a small town and know i know nothing. who is smarter now? i love the country. there is nothing like it. big city people are pop people. they are so one way and not another. all the cheerleaders dress like brittney, all the guys dress like backstreet boys or some rapper from the east coast they wish they could be like. in the country its all different. anything goes believe it or not. everyone listens to everything. everyone can dress however the hell they want to on any day and no one think differently. that's another thing that confuses me. i'm from the country and i listen to all kinds of music. everyone i meet is pretty much into one thing and thinks the other stuff is lesser quality until i put some stuff on and they say oh i like that now. but they know more than me. jester is like westgate. drugs are everywhere and easily obtained. you just got to know who to ask. i'm glad i ain't into that. i stick with some beer myself. its funny how beer is harder to get than drugs here and everywhere i've been. the government has their focus on the wrong areas. i don't know much about government because it was so boring to me in high school. i may not even vote in this election because i don't see a real point in it. someone else has narrowed down my options so evidently they got that far they can do the rest. i miss brother sid. it hurt me when i found out he had passed on but i didn't cry. i really liked listening to him speak in church. he had a real way with words and was very emotional. our new preacher is a lot different as was to be accepted but its still not the same. he tries to make things to complicated and show his intelligence when everyone knows you are suppose to preach on a 3rd grade level. but why is that? that's like saying hey you wont get very far in your spiritual education if you never get higher that the third grade. third grade was when i broke my ankle outside running and some black girls started laughing at me. i stayed in school the rest of the day and was tough you know, trying to act tough. i didn't cry the next year either when i really messed it up jumping on a trampoline. i cried when i couldn't play baseball though. that was when i was good at baseball. before i wanted to quit so bad and cried while i was playing. of course i had a lot of shit going on in my life then. adolescence can be a bitch. but i was lucky enough to make it through it and once i got out of my depression i haven't really been in one since. i get sad a lot and have notorious mood swings but nothing major. rosanne is a huge influence in my life. i've never heard anyone else say that. she's has a totally different approach to life. laugh at yourself in the mirror every morning. make fun of yourself before others do so they know it doesn't really bother you and they wont make fun of you for whatever. water. drink. wet. still thirsty after every drink. don't know why that is. can't get the taste of chips out of my mouth right now. taste always makes me hungry. but i've already ate so there is no need to now that i am full and don't need to eat. i wonder what lindsey is doing right now? i think i have figured her out. she likes to tell people what she thinks will sound good and never lives up to anything she tells me. but she's my friend still. my friends in paris have all moved away. i wonder what andrew is doing in arkansas right now. he just moved the other day i think cause of crazy ass aliece. she gets weirder and weirder everyday. like stevens roommate russell. that boy is strange. he thinks he is mr. badass and knows everything. i wonder if he knows he's a spaz. he said my car system sounded like shit. he's listened to good systems and mine is shit. first time anyone has ever told me that before. maybe its true but still i don't even know they guy that well and he's only heard one time but he knows. i'm stupid. my arms hurt. they need to be stretched. i wonder how long i've written for. my roommate likes to play videogames and turn the sound up loud. have some respect man. i don't do stuff like that to him. i'm glad everyone isn't like me. then id feel different. have you ever thought of life as a cartoon or wished you could do stuff in cartoons? it makes it much more interesting. it also makes me more creative i think. or crazier. but i like doing it anyways. i haven't had a square in 4 days now. haven't had a beer since i've been here. maybe i will but i don't really miss it. they were wrong when they said i couldn't have fun without beer. what were they thinking? what was i thinking. i wish i would meet a girl that meshed with me. but if only get my treated badly again. oh well i'm not going to change cause i know one day it'll get me the girl i've been looking for. finish ",1
"it is about 93% hispanic and 5% anglo and 3% other. my house is an hour west of south padre island, where my family owns a condo at suntide i and a sailboat in which we dock it at the sea ranch. i will arrive home aroung four thirty or five to go back to my highschool and surprise my boyfriend jason. he will be practising basketball when iget there because he doen't expect me home till six. then i will go home and see my mom, sister,and dog cocoa. cocoa is a chocolate lab that has been missing me very much . she gets extreemly excited every time my boyfriend goes over thinking that i should be around there some where. around seven i will leave to go to about an hour of a football game. see the cheerleading squad that i miss and the band march which i miss just as much. then from there iwill leave and go to the beach, with jason. my mon and sister willalready be there. when i get there my mom promised to bbq my favorite foods, since the dorm food has already gotten old. then at the beach i will spend quality time with my family and take cocoa for walks on the beach, where she loves to run in the ocean and chase sea gulls. i most importantly can't wait to take those long romantic walks on the beach at night with my boyfriend, whom i love and miss very much. on saturdaymy dad and little brother will meet us there after the hunting trip. sunday my neighbors will come down. they are my family down there because our closest relative is in wisconsin. they will bring all there children, which adds up to seven. my boyfriends parents and little brother will also be meeting us down there as well. i can't wait to spend time with all those people, and tell them about my new family up here. i just got into a sorority, a week ago tomorrow. alpha delta pi is the one that i got into, and i love it. they make us study ten hours a week at the house which i think will a positive thing for everyone. however i will miss my roommate this weekend. her name is alyssa bauer and is also a engineerig major like myself. i'm going into civil though and she is going into mechanical. but we get along very well. this is her lab top that i', writing this assignment on right now. she is so sweet. she is even saportive of me being in a sorority. and we went pot luck.

" well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that i have ever done, i can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 20 minutes, wait 28 minutes and 30 seconds. that was some math i was hoping to avoid. i wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact i shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, yes! oh wait no thats not right there is still that whole writing thing i'm doing. come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. for better or for worse. at least the week has begun. in high school thats the last thing i would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how i feel now. upon self reflection though i realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that i had to work all weekend. oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. looking around the room i see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. the last one that i got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in ireland did they say they were from? can't remember. anyway the poster was one i had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. it's a nice photograph of an h bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. good. even though this is a course assignment i feel very idle, a feeling that i don't particularly like. don't get me wrong i like not having anything to do but i have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. i wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). well of course it wouldn't, but i am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. the abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking i need to finish that first chapter). it was something that i had never given much thought to other then what i saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. i had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now i have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (i wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? if there wasnt there should be. except maybe with they dozens of typos i am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. continue writing? i don't think so.

"my day has been a really good day today. i meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the central market cafe. then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. he accused me of seeing another guy and i told him the truth that i was seeing another guy. we talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. it made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months i have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. i wanted to talk to somebody and when nick came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. nick is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. the when i got home i started thinking about how far behind i was on all of my school work and i began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. then i was thinking about what my health promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. so i am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that i can stay ahead. so i am finally getting to this writing assignment that i had no idea about until last monday. this just added to the stress that i was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because i am doing this assignment. i am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now i am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. she always sounds so miserable on the phone when i talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. my dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but i think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. she had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. she acts so depressed when i hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. i love my mother to death but i just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. anyways i think that school is going to turn out really good and i hope that i can keep up my grades and make it into the nursing school. i am already into the pre nursing school but i have to test into the nursing school in order to become a registered nurse. i am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. i want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when i graduate. i really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. i want to help people out and i don't want to feel like i didn't help them out by letting a person die.

" well, the biggest thing that i have been thinking about is of course, my boyfriend! he is in san antonio, and i miss him so much! i was fortunate enough to see him the past two weekends. this last weekend i got to see him play in his first college football game at trinity! it was really exciting, but it stunk because unlike in high school, i wasn't on the track cheering for him. i was also super happy because i have been able to see my family. i am such a nerd, because i miss my mom so much! she has always been there for me, so it is actually kind of hard to make my own decisions. but it is also good, cause it is definitely time for me to grow up! my brother came in town for the first time in several months and i did not get to see him, but it didn't bother me, because i know he didn't miss me. he was away for the navy, and i wrote him a letter, and he never wrote me back. he has put my family through so much crap, that i don't know when i am going to be strong enough to see him. thank god the rest of my family is so caring and sane! life goes on, and he will soon realize how important his family really is, especially after all we have done for him. at first, i was extremely nervous about school and sorority rush, but now everything is getting better. i was so glad when i became a zeta because that is what i wanted from the start. it was just kind of hard because when we were practicing for phi psi field day, they tried to put me up in a stunt, and made me feel soooo fat. i am already so self conscious about my weight, so it really hurt me. i really don't want to have an eating disorder, especially after a movie being made about my aunt and her failure as an olympic athlete because of balimia. well, now after almost eight minutes, my arm hurts so much, and all i am wondering is when this is going to be over with!!! i also hope that my studies turn out ok because i really have to study to get good grades, like really! i am just not smart like everyone else, or at least that is how i feel. i mean i like all my professors except for pre-cal, which really pisses me off because i took pre-cal and calculus in high school and aced them both. but this adjunct teacher does not teach at all. he goes over the basic formulas, which i have known since like eighth grade, and then gives us the most difficult homework, which he has not given any examples for or ways to understand in class. he also words the problems in the most bizarre ways. all the students are so confused, and it makes me feel so stupid, because it is just pre-cal! so, today i went to the university of texas learning center, and it really seemed to help. i think out of my class of thirty, there was three of us at that moment in there. so that already says enough about our teacher. also, i emailed him about it, and he made me feel even stupider. i mean if he wants respect from me, then he needs to respect me! he told me he couldn't pat my hand to make me feel better, etc. , and i was like, yeah, but you could try and teach us, instead of going over 8th grade algebra!!! but oh well, i am trying to fix everything! i just decided that i am going to be on top of all my studies, and try to keep up on the reading and all my math homework. i hope that i never forget about any important tests, or assignments, or papers. i am super glad i am in a fig, because hopefully that will help. i am just super horrible with tests, because i have a major test anxiety. that would explain my horrible sat score. but whatever, it is all good, i mean look, i made it to ut, didn't i~! well, since psychology is my major i hope this class keeps me super interested so i don't switch majors like five times, like every other college student! i just want to know what i want to do with my life, besides marry my sweetie, and be successfull with my family and money. but, so far, i am so glad i have chosen ut, because i absolutely love it, and even though there have already been those times when i have felt so fat, or so overloaded with sorority stuff or reading( which i am also very slow at!), i know everything in the end will turn out just how it is supposed to, because god is here carrying me through out all my good times and my bad! i just hope i can figure out this pretesting thing, because that would be awesome if i didn't have to do five hours worth of experiments, ya know!!

"many why's are predominant. why do i seem to feel unwanted at times? why do i seem to feel betrayed at times. why do i seem to feel like a failure at times? why do i seem to have lost a yearn for optimism? many of these feelings come and go but many do stay implanted in my head. my head is just a constant waterfall. tons of ideas rushing through mixing at a point which creates pandemonium. my head is a maze which produces many blocks such as this wall, why when my mother phones me i become bored all of a sudden? i love her dearly and i know that she must be lonely with all her kids off to college. it is because she misses me and because she loves me. why can't i make that extra effort to make her feel wanted. what can't i give her the same feeling that she makes me feel. emotions run one-sided in her phone calls. i feel a superfluous feeling of want and she must not feel any. corrections can be made to this but i just don't try. how can i think that i am determined to do well in college? how can i feel that i will be persistent and successful in life? if i can feel determined, persistent, and successful in these things, then why is it that i feel determined, persistent, and successful, right before i speak to my mom in order to make her feel wanted and then i fail. is this a preview of what is to come in my future, not only with family relations but also with life experiences. will i continue to think """"i can"""" and will i continue to fail? how can i practice my ways to perfect them. how can i execute my feelings and my hopes. how can i make them come true. how many times do i have to continue to tell myself that this is the way its going to be or that that is the way it is going to be and in the back of my mind i know that it will never be the way that i intend it to be. does this mean that i am a failure? what does it mean? should it be something to worry about. will my mother some day get """"fed-up"""" with me. can this defect ruin my entire life? is it a defect? why do i think about this stuff? is it just conscious nature? why all these whys i don't know, but what i do know is that there is purpose for everything, and maybe my purpose of life was to wonder why.

"as for now, i feel as if quite a weight of stress has been lifted off of my shoulders. i had many things to accomplish once i started school here at the university of texas and i am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as i achive the goals i need to. for instance, today, i needed to petition credit of hours which i earned off of the ap testing which i took in highschool. i attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason, even though i typed the correct web site, i could not actually claim my hours. thus i actually went to the measures and evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores. also, the week before school started, i was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card i purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures. at that time, one evening i finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly. thankfully, right now i am a much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior. for example, i began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in cicago ilinois. i am starting to miss all of my friends and my family. the voices of my loved family do not leave my head. instead, their words repeatedly play in my mind as they are right now. i remember things my brother said to me whether it was great advice, or even a comment which brought me down. many times i feel that i can trust my brothers opinion since he tells me anything i need to know extremely bluntly and straight out. all my female friends i know may try to beat around the bush by telling me a point. i do the same thing. i care for my friends and try to tell them everything in a very nice way. however, when it comes to my biological brother, he is probably the most honest boy who has ever spolken to me. who has ever spoken to me. i miss him a lot. actually i probably would not have been so homesick had my roommate not convinced me how much more comfortable and relaxed i would be at home. last weekend, she went home to visit her family and friends. when she came back, she told me that she was looking forward for the next weekend so she could go home and sleep in her own room once again. wow, how could i not imagine how nice it would be for me to go home as well and see all my old friends again. i really miss them. in addition, i miss my friends which go to different schools. i keep pictures of them to reminfd me of the friendship they shared with me. it is almost as if they are close in a way, but, not really. my mom on the other hand may just miss me quite a bit. i am looking forward to seeing her since she is in california visiting my precious grandmother right now. i'm very close to my mom and that is why i believe that my leaving may affect her and me. we are like best friends who tell each other anything in our lives. she cares for me and i hope that whatever i choose to do with my life i can impress her. however i would never do anything simply because of the reason that only she wants it of me. in fact she trusts me well enough to know that i will be able to grow up to be an independent person with great values, goals, and striving ambitions. my mother also helps in relieving my endless stress. just knowing that i can count on both my parents aids me in relaxing and doing the best that i can.

"this will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something i'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. i'm listening ti the lord of the rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!! brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. half the time i walk around bundled in every layer of clothes i can find-- i feel liek an eskimo!! of course i wouldn't be in my room so much if things at ut were going a little better. sorry, usually i'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. i feel like i don't know anyone, which i don't, and sometimes i 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. a feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. i'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. however, once i get to know them, i 'll open right up. yep, i'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. my parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. i thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. my sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which i am definitely looking foward to. so, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, i do my homework. i must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at ut. spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). philosophy, poesis and psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. i knew i loved english, suspected i'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of psychology, but i had no idea i'd find philosophy even slightly interesting. right now, i'm reading about the hindu religion. i love the idea that i'm getting education!! psychology and philosophy fit so well together, too. usually i study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. while philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. it's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in psychology will back up a wispy thought in philosophy. now i'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. i read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. there was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. at first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. however, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. she gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. i clicked it away feeling very depressed. she was actually in love with the actor. however, i realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. reading this, i'd say my passion was homework. that's almost just as distrubing.

"i just got of the phone with my best friend lauren from home (potomac, md) and it was weird because she hasn't left for school yet - she is going to the university of pennsylvania - so when i talk to her we are coming from such different perspectives right now and it is really strange since we have always been so similar in everything before. we were talking about our other good friend meryl who is going to cornell and has been there for about the same amount of time that i have been here and she was saying how she has been talking to her everyday but that meryl is so happy and has so many friends and even a new boyfriend and i was saying how that is really weird and annoying because i honestly am pretty happy and having what i think is a fairly normal adjustment to college but i don't have like a real group of friends yet or anything and it isn't everything that i had hoped college would be yet, but i figure that i have only been here for two weeks. lauren was saying that what she thinks is so weird about it though is that meryl says that she goes out everynight and loves school and everything but she calls her everyday and i say that i am still adjusting etc and i don't even have time to talk to her everyday. i don't know, i just think that it is really annoying and try not to talk to meryl too much because it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me since things aren't going quite as well for me and it makes me feel sort of bitter towards her. tonight i went out to dinner with my friend katie who i met when i went on camp texas and i love. we went to the hula hut and it was really good because i had really been away from campus and the whole ut thing since i got here and i was sort of starting to feel like i was stuck in a bubble and out of touch with reality so it was good to get away for a little bit. plus, the food was really good and i hadn't had a real good meal since i got here either. it also made me more sure that i had made the right decision about going home for a the weekend of sept. 17-20 (for the jewish holiday) because i saw that it was good to be in car and get away and realized that it would definately be good for me to get away for a longer period of time. before i went to dinner tonight i was worried that i wouldn't want to go because i would feel like i was missing things here but now i see that i definately did make the right decision. also when i go home i am going to drive up to penn for the night to see lauren and when i was talking to her it sounded like she was really excited to see me so that is good too. i feel like i should be really stressed right now about schoolwork and everything with this being my first semester of college and my first time at a big, public school since i attended a small private high school but i honestly feel like i have less work then i did in high school and that it is easier - plus i am really staying on top of it. the only concern that i am having at all is the size of my classes (all of them have over 200 people in them) because i am used to being in classes with about 15 people in them and recieving a lot of focused attention from my teachers and although i am not concerned about this affecting my performance as i feel that i am completely capable on my own, i am worried i will be overlooked and just be a number in crowd - which i'm sure that i will be in a lot of my classes, at least for a while. so far though i like my classes at least and find them interesting and all of my professors do seem to be pretty interesting and approachable. i also rushed and am pledging a sorority which, even though i really like it and am happy that i did it is becoming more and more time consuming and i getting worried that i am going to have trouble completing everything that i need to do for that but i am sure that it will not be as tough as i am expecting. right now i am listening to a really good cd that lauren sent me that our friend dave made for me and it is so good because it is a mix that he made of all of these really good old songs plus a couple of good new ones. i have three minutes left to write now and i am really running out of things to say except that earlier i found a cricket or grasshopper or something in my room and it is really gross and i don't know how it got up here because i like on the 11th floor of dobie and there are no windows but it is totally gross and i am definately going to file a complaint and tell the front desk that i need an exterminator or something. well i think that my time is up now so bye.

"i really want to go swimming but i don't want to tell sylvia that i don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. i really want to go home this weekend. i know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with gera even after i haven't seen her for a while. maybe i just don't want to go out with him i think that i feel guilty for some strange reason and i can't get the courage to tell gera. this air conditioner is really bothering me. it makes so much noise and does not cool very much. i am so hungry. my roommate sucks. i don't know why i'm so mean. maybe i'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything i do. maybe she's just too smart and i feel stupid. i'm really hungry. i don't know how i'm going to get to eat if i go with sylvia and loni. i wonder if gera is calling me right at this moment. i wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. i think i'm making too much noise typing. i get the feeling that i'm disturbing everyone behind me. i can't believe loni. she just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. i wonder if her parents know the way she is. i still have one more question to do for economics and i don't really feel like reading. i learned that i should wait to be told what to read before i stress that stress test sylvia and i took was weird. i think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. i bet he thought i was weird. he could right away tell what was bothering sylvia. i know that manny really has sylvia thinking about him day and night. he's such a jerk. i can't believe what how could someone treat someone that way. maybe love is blind. i wonder why people around here are so free. i can't believe that girl i say two days ago. she was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. i assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. i wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. i had to turn around for a second. i think that i'm a nosy person. i often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. during lunch today i listened to two complete conversations. i could not believe the things that people talk about. why does my roommate have to be so selfish. i think that i want to make everyone healthy. i don't know why but i am so self conscience of the way i look. but i hear that is actually average in girls my age. i went all out on this diet until i lost up to 25 pounds and now i think that i am too skinny. but i say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do i gross myself out when i see my roommate eating horrible and then i see her change and i feel that i have to go workout. she gets offended very easily. i don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly.

"stream of consciousness - well, the first thing that comes to mind is why exactly do i have to do this? i know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. i am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. i want to become a doctor but then again i want to be a musician too. i mean i have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. i want to continue but a part of me is saying - you need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! i want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. i don't know what to write about anymore! i'm laughing at myself because whatever i am typing i am literally reading it out loud to myself as i write it. i'm thinking is that normal? anyway, i'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and i am amazed as just how fast i type without formal or informal training. i then think about how blessed i am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once i figure out which dream is possible or realistic. how do i know that my major is the right one? i mean, i am now a microbiology'pre-med ,major and i don't know if that's my fate. should i be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. i am looking at how long i have been typing. only 13 minutes. the phone just rang and i had to answer it; i hate that happened because i was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if i would write continuously. what am i talking about? well, anyway, i enjoy music and stage. i like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. my contacts are bothering me; somehow i have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, i was just disturbed for about 15 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his ethernet card. but guess what i am almost done . i just have a few more minutes. i don't what to write about. i hope that this class is going to be very beneficial. i hope to learn alot because psychology, esp. the physiological aspects really interest me. i'm wondering whether or not i will get an """"a"""" this semester for psy 301. well, i'm done!

"right now i feel as if i need to sleep. well i at least need to start sleeping on a regular schedule. i have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. i think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. i also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and i think that i still have senioritis. i just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades. i am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that i had this summer. they are actually things that i am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that i had to deal with in the summer semester here. i absolutely love ut, i don't think that there is any way that i could have stayed at home much longer. i'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. i have even started to call austin home. this really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. i miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that i dislike being at home. i love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. i love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. i feel that i am a disappointment to them though. i am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. she got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like ut. i love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. we have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. right now, i am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. he drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. i think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. i really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. i also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is dance. i have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. i love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. but, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. i need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. aside from my weird sleeping schedule, i also am really weird when it comes to eating. i don't think that i have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. i think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. i do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. i have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. i know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. i do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. i hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. i am going home this weekend for my boyfriends birthday. i miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to ut. i don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. i have less than two minutes left and i have absolutely no clue of what to write. i think that after i am done with this i am going to go eat some lasagne. i have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. i think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.

"my suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. i really should go to bed so i won't be tired in the morning, but i want to get this done so i don't have to worry about it later. the tag on my shirt itches. i need to cut it off. my suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. my roommate is studying still. someone just slammed a door down the hall. my suitemates are being loud again. my back kind of hurts. it must be from carrying my backpack around all day. i'm really tired. at least i don't have class until 10 in the morning. i'll get a little more sleep. i need to remember to go to the co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. i bet i'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. i should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. she asked me why i had to type for twenty minutes. i've only been typing for 5 minutes! my suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. my feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. i hope i do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. i studied all my notes and read the chapters. i'm getting sleepier, but i have to finish this. they're being loud again. they are loud a lot. i think the second night i was here, they came in at 4:30 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. me and my roommate are quiet. someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. i think it was dani, but it may have been amelia. i can't tell their voices apart yet. i think amelia is the one with a job at footlocker. my roommate is popping her knuckles. i pop mine a lot. i need to stop. everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. i don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. i just popped my knuckles out of habit. someone just slammed a door again. everyone always slams doors. maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. i only have five minutes left. that's good because i think my roommate is done studying for the evening. now she is typing on her computer and laughing. she must be iming someone. it is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in el paso, or maybe it is her friend louie that i met the other day. i wonder who's online that i can talk to right now. probably no one. i need to go to bed anyway. i'm glad i gat my calculus homework done. i got a 94 on it, so i'm pretty happy. that's good considering i didn't get any help on it. i need to find a study group for calculus. i probably need them for all my classes. my roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. i said yes. they do go out a lot. i don't think i've ever seen them study. my friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. i wonder how they are going to pass their classes. i'm almost done. i only have 30 more seconds. then i get to go to bed. good night!

"i don't like people to know how my mind works if i don't even know them. i guess i have always been protective of my true thoughts and feelings. the irony is that the more you reveal of your self, the better you get to know and become closer to your friends. the first few steps of trust can be some of the hardest (besides the ones after a loss of trust). i think that it is possible to gain trust back. it takes a long time and complete honesty, but it should be acheivable. it is really funny. people say that they don't trust any one they don't know, but they trust checkout people and opperators all the time. just think about how much information is handed out each day between people that don't know each other. of course we would be quite paranoid if we didn't trust any one. it just seems like we are ready to talk to some one we have never met before and never will see again more than we would talk to some one in a new class. people are overly concerned with making good impressions. it is important to realize that we are all pron to error. i say this, but i still worry about making good first impressions. i worry about it more if i think i am going to see the person again. if i don't think we will ever meet again, i am more relaxed. my mind is currently switching between a rapid pace of thoughts to blanking out. it is really scarry to think that your mind can just go blank when your not really doing any thing. i can understand your mind blanking out on a particular subject while you are trying to consentration on it, but the total lack of thought is just wierd. oh my gosh. i just looked at the clock. i hope i have time to take a shower before the floor meeting. i have been going every where to day including a short (very short) workout at the gym. i probably smell. not that i did that much exercise today. all the machines were full so i was only able to do two machines today. if i had been with a friend i would have stayed longer since i would have had some one to talk to in line while waiting. athletic centers can be very intemidating places. every one always seems to know what they are doing and seems to be in great shape. of course, if you go to work out enough, you are going to be in shape. my back really hurts. i need to sit strait. i am always slouching over. i try to keep my back strait; it just never works for too long. i'm getting tired now. typing is becoming harder as i become sleepier. sleep is such an important part of my life. i probably sleep way too much, but it is better than some habbits people have. there is a consceted statement. trying to say that i am better than some other people. who do i think i am? we all have are assests and faults. what time is it? i really need to go soon. i just hope that when i get there i don't smell too bad or say my thoughts out loud. i am not saying them out loud, but typing them is very similar. the toughts must be processed to make sense and be comunicated. writing is just a different form of comunication compared to talking. i hope i can find this place. i wish i had a friend to go with me. large social events can be intemidating when every one seems to already know eachother. may be some of the people i met saturday night will be there. then i can finally figure out two of their names. it is so weird. i can remember the conversation we had, what they wore, where we were sitting, every thing but their names. i can't ask them because they remember mine. i don't want to hurt their feelings. i have to go now so i can get there on time.

"today i had a very fun (sarcastic) schedule, i worked out and also participated in my nrotc drill team, which i am a part of. my thoughts are nothing but satisfaction, a vigorous week of pt (physical training), academics, drill, and discipline have finally ended for three glorious days to elapse. yes, just another three days or so, then it's back to the normal vigorous routine. my feelings for joining the nrotc unit is my decision, the option to choose the path to become a marine corps commissioned officer is brave for my part. for the past week, pt has been vigorous and i sometimes find myself out of shape for the activities. my ankle, which has a long history of spraining, is not helping either. my gunnery sergeant and my staff sergeant and i agreed that the leathernecks, the """"marine corps"""" part of the team, will help me get up to standards, after all, the leathernecks and the entire unit looks after its own. looks after it's own. i want to be part of the team, a part of the unit, a player, a leader, not a manager, not a weakling, nor any of that. i want to prove that i am someone. that i am a human being, someone worthy of being respected and liked. i have had a couple of bad experiences before i reported to ut. one was that i broke up with my girlfriend for the summer. she and i, even though we liked each other, found out that we were 'incompatible' and the separation of college (me going to ut, she going to u of h) would only make things worse. sometimes we would find ourselves arguing over something as petty as 'who left the door open?'. it was a bad experience and the breakup just before college hit me like a mack truck, just like all my bad experiences before. after my breakup, i wonder whether i should date again. there's a nice girl (i won't name her name or how i know her) around that i know but i don't know if i should get to know her more. maybe it's because i had a bad history of dating, and i sometimes wonder if i would take the circle path back to where i started, broken up and feeling depressed about myself. this girl, i like her a lot, and i think she thinks i'm ok, but i don't know if she really likes me. to take another risk like that will probably leave me either being shunned my rejection or being depressed by another break up. that's why i must concentrate on other things. my priority is to the team, and i will work as much as i can to get my unit up and running. i am in the pistol and the drill team and i want to learn more and know more. also, i want to get a 4. 0 gpa, so i can get a scholarship from my unit. pt has been tough, i find myself being killed by the active duty marines when we pt, but i can't quit. my ankle had me forced to drop out of the runs two times, but i won't quit the program. i cannot quit, and i will not quit. to quit will put me forever in disgrace as a quitter who couldn't 'hack it' and also in the shun of my teammates, who i left them high and dry by letting them down. to quit would also to put me down further into the downward spiral of depression. to quit is out of the question. i will keep on going no matter what happens and i will do anything that has to be done to pass. i will not fail.

"my stream of consciousness is being disrupted by several things at this time. my computer has been giving me nothing but continual stress and troubles. first, my computer is a piece of crap. i called a guy to come hook everything up to it and he basically laughed and was unable to figure it out. then the guy told me to take it to the campus computer store. i carried the entire, heavy hard drive to the store in the heat. while there, everyone i talked to laughed at me. i ate dinner alone, as i usually do since i have not made very many new friends. i have had no sleep because of how many classes i've had to take this semester because of credit hours and retouching courses. i am so stressed out. i just learned that my cdrom drive isn't working so i'm about to cry because now when i go home this weekend i have to convince my parents to fork over a bunch of money they don't have so my computer will be like everyone else's'. my roommate's dad went through and installed everything one can possibly think of so she laughs at my computer problems which makes me feel worse. i miss my home and my dogs and my boyfriend and my friends so much that now i'm crying. all the stress i'm feeling is making me depressed and hungry and tired all the time. gale, my roommate keeps me up really late at night and then wakes up at 6:30 to put on alot of makeup. she is so loud that i want to scream, but instead i keep my mouth shut because it feels like when i open my mouth to say things that might hurt peoples feelings or make them mad i end up losing the close relationship i had with them. so i guess i'm sort of keeping everything inside so that i don't lose any few friends that i made. it seems like everyone makes better grades than me here. i am so scared because i have so many questions about ut but nobody seems to know how to answer them. i knew that moving up here would be a big change, but i thought i could handle it. i know that once i adjust i will grow very strong and independent from this experience, but i feel that i may not be ready. i don't wear makeup for some reason that i have never been able to figure out. i always feel like i need improvement in something. like with this essay, even though i know the length of it does not matter, i still feel it must be long to be acceptable. when i walk around to my classes i see so many people that they all look the same to me. it is so hot outside when i walk. i'm so thirsty right now that i am going to send this paper so i can get a drink. then i'm going to call my mother and beg for a computer like everyone else has so i can feel like i fit in more. i won't get it so now i've got to prepare to use gale's computer all year. my boyfriend is driving up here on friday to spend the day with me at ut. i wish i had my own apartment so i could get some sleep.

"i am happy that i made the transition from georgia tech to ut. i am cautious about my future and what i want to get involved in. i want to become a texas wrangler but i am unsure that they will take me. i want to do well in school and get in to law school. i don't study as much as i want to, and i need to work on that. i love sports and i like football most of all. i wish i had played football was a kid. i am excited about the future of our country and i want to get involved. i don't understand what this assignment is about, but i will write everything that is on my mind. i worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. i try to be the best student and person that i can be. i have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way i have been raised. i've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and i try to be the best at everything. i knew that is bad, but i feel that that is the way i was born. i believe our president is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. he is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. i have a roommate that is good. he is norwegian and is a great student. he is fun to hang out with and we get along well. i have a girlfriend and i'm not sure if we should stay together. we get along well, but i feel like i have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. , we share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. my parents are strong christians, but ?i am not sure that that is what i want. college is a time to figure all of this out, and i am glad i am here. it is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. i am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. i want to be an attorney and i feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. i want to be the best that i can be and make a good future for myself. my mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. it is a lot of pressure from her, and i try to be a role model for my younger brother. he is a trouble maker, and i want to be a positive influence in his life. he is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. i love my family very much. i can't wait for the ut ucla football game. i love the game and i love the school spirit it provides. i was an engineering major at georgia tech last year and i made the switch to ut all by myself. i am proud of that move, and i wouldn't have it any other way. it was the best move i've ever made. i like the big school here and the number of students here. i want to run for public office when i get older and make this country a better place. i feel like i can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. i am a good person, and i believe others will think so too.

"well, right now i just woke up from a mid-day nap. it's sort of weird, but ever since i moved to texas, i have had problems concentrating on things. i remember starting my homework in 10th grade as soon as the clock struck 4 and not stopping until it was done. of course it was easier, but i still did it. but when i moved here, the homework got a little more challenging and there was a lot more busy work, and so i decided not to spend hours doing it, and just getting by. but the thing was that i always paid attention in class and just plain out knew the stuff, and now that i look back, if i had really worked hard and stayed on track the last two years without getting lazy, i would have been a genius, but hey, that's all good. it's too late to correct the past, but i don't really know how to stay focused n the future. the one thing i know is that when people say that b'c they live on campus they can't concentrate, it's b. s. for me it would be easier there, but alas, i'm living at home under the watchful eye of my parents and a little nagging sister that just nags and nags and nags. you get my point. another thing is, is that it's just a hassle to have to go all the way back to school to just to go to library to study. i need to move out, but i don't know how to tell them. don't get me wrong, i see where they're coming from and why they don't want me to move out, but i need to get away and be on my own. they've sheltered me so much and i don't have a worry in the world. the only thing that they ask me to do is keep my room clean and help out with the business once in a while, but i can't even do that. but i need to. but i got enough money from ut to live at a dorm or apartment next semester and i think i'll take advantage of that. but off that topic now, i went to sixth street last night and had a blast. i haven't been there in so long. now i know why i love austin so much. when i lived in va, i used to go up to dc all the time and had a blast, but here, there are so many students running around at night. i just want to have some fun and i know that i am responsible enough to be able to have fun, but keep my priorities straight. living at home, i can't go out at all without them asking where? with who? why? when are you coming back? and all those questions. i just wish i could be treated like a responsible person for once, but my sister screwed that up for me. she went crazy the second she moved into college and messed up her whole college career by partying too much. and that's the ultimate reason that they don't want me to go and have fun. but i'm not little anymore, and they need to let me go and explore the world, but i'm indian; with indian culture, with indian values. they go against """"having fun. """" i mean in the sense of meeting people or going out with people or partying or just plain having fun. my school is difficult already, but somehow i think that having more freedom will put more pressure on me to do better in school b'c that's what my parents and ultimately i expect of myself. well it's been fun writing, i don't know if you go anything out of this writing, but it helped me get some of my thoughts into order. so i hope you had fun reading it and good luck ta's.

"last night around 11pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door. she told me that a guy i went to high school with had just committed suicide on friday. apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse (which i had no idea was even an issue with him) and he stormed out of the house. no one knew where he was so they went looking for him. they found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine (some of my friends still live there, too). it still hasn't hit me yet. i have been at school with him since the first grade. i know that at the funeral, it will definitely hit me. after last year i thought everything was going to be better. at the beginning of the school year (actually the summer before my senior year) kyle committed suicide by hanging himself. after getting over that, will was killed in a car accident. after coping with will's death, i thought nothing else was going to happen. i mean, two deaths (not to mention the death of teacher) happened within the span of about three or so months. the rest of my year was going great until april. that was when i found out that one of the girls who i had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide. she overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep. i couldn't believe it. for years i would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school. going to her funeral was the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i cried the minute i got there and didn't stop crying until days later. seeing her parents made it even harder. i mean what can you say to them. nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better. nothing could make you feel any better either. she had an open casket, so as we walked out after the service was over, we had to pass by her. i absolutely and completely fell apart. i couldn't see where i was going i was crying so hard. even now as i am writing this assignment i'm getting tearyeyed. i still don't understand (and i probably never will) why anyone could take their life like that. i mean, don't they know how many people need them, how many people depend on them, or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we're around them. marshall is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary'junior high school. everyone always talks about how things like that come in three's. now i'm just wondering if the saying will come true. will there be a third suicide or death that i'll have to deal with? i really and truly hope so. i sure as hell can't take another death or another funeral for that matter. when i first started this assignment i didn't think that i'd have much to say, but that doesn't look like the case. this is kind of therapeutic though. i'm tired of talking and thinking about a gloomy subject like death, so i've decided to start typing about something better. i really excited to be here at the university. i really love it here. my classes and professors are great. i am worried'anxious about final exams though, but i still have awhile before those come around. i'm still getting used to the fact that you pretty much get one grade at the end of the semester. unlike in elementary through high school in which every 3 weeks you got a progress report and then every 6 weeks came your report card. i'm also getting used to being alone a lot. sometimes you have to eat by yourself, or sit in class by yourself, etc. but then again you meet so many new people. well, my time's up.

"i've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. i was really scared when i first left, and i questioned myself if i was really ready for this big of a step. once i got here there was no turning back. i would feel like a failure if i had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. being away taught me a little about love too. i always knew i loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. now that we are separated i know how much they really mean to me. it almost feels like i have lost them and i am thinking about all those things i wish i had said then. i guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. overall i really like it here. i like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like austin is my home and not my family's. they will have to come to my city to visit me. i really miss my girlfriend mandi. she is at a&m but she hates it there. she came to visit me here and fell in love with austin. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. that makes the future look very bright to me. she was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. i really think she is my guardian angel. she came into my life at a point where i was about to be headed downhill. i helped her in a lot of ways too. i am glad that she doesn't like it at a&m but i would rather her be happy than anything. she has called me countless times this semester balling. it frustrates me because there is nothing i can do for her. i just can't wait until we are back together here in austin. that will be paradise. i can see myself living here for the rest of my life. it has a little bit of everything. if you want beauty, head for the hills, if you want history, head for the capitol, and guadalupe is texas' little piece of california. i am going back home to tyler in two weeks. i don't think the town will seem the same. it already seems like the place that i spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. i guess it seems that way because i already know i am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. my parents treat me like an adult now. i had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when i was having a hard time. he really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. when i go back i plan to really show more respect than i used to. i'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. i want to make them proud.

"let's see. i'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. not that she's not a cool person or anything, i just can concentrate better when i'm alone and when it is quiet. but that is almost impossibe here in jester. there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. like right now! oh well, it is something i must get used to. or i can do what i did last night. wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night. my fingers are freezing! this room is so cold! i haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. i'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket. i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i cannot wear shorts like i used to back at home. aw, home! i think i am starting to miss being at home. i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. this, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. i do go back home on thursday night, but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta. i am competing in a sports tournament for my church. i am playing flag football and running track. another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i've been dating for less than a month. well, i've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. it's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that, but only because i didn't want to be mean. he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. that was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, i really don't care anymore. he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met. i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. a week after we broke things off, this new guy i'm dating told me he had feelings for me. i was so confused and didn't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks. but i'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. because of that, i decided that i'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. we decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. my ex found out and was extremely jealous. it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. but oh well, that's life i guess. i am really glad i continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. i spent every day with him until the day i left. i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. he is amazing. the only thing i'm worried about is that i'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i don't think i'm quite ready for another one. that's the only problem i'm having right now. the fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. but the distance might become an issue. it was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. but yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut. but i am definitely loving it here in austin. i enjoy all of my professors and classes. having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. in addition i am taking this psychology class, which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. other than that i have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment. ah, my hands are still so cold. what do i do?! my ears are feeling very cold too. must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room?! or my bad, it is the fall now. same thing. today is the day for my mile run. ever since i moved to austin, i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym. i absolutely love that place! and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester. freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape! i find that i've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer. i really love this lifestyle i have at ut. the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but i do not feel like i am abusing it. i did party a lot this weekend, but i didn't drink or anything. people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. i don't want people to view me as a party girl because i'm not out of control or anything. oh well. i see that this writing is almost up. that wasn't too bad!

""""" stream of consciousness """" everyday about now, i am still sleeping. i feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. i thought i would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but it has not hit me yet. this morning, while watching cnn, and still seeing the coverage of princess diana, made me sad. it makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. he had ten hours of surgery. what pain i thought. i kept on asking myself why did g-d let him live. why not someone like princess diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. she did so much for other people. she even raffled her dresses of for charity. what a women. i'm feeling a little bit tired now. the psy experiment i did today was a fun experiment. i enjoyed it. i sat next to a cute girl. i hope today's classes will go fast. i would like to take a nap today. just to sleep and rest for an hour. it was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. it was a nice surprise. also, i saw one of my friends from home on campus. it is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. my mother went on business and i hope she is doing well. i hope she got well rested today. i hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. i try to put myself in a better mood everyday. i think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. an example is i worry about friends, family, grades, whether i am behind or don't understand something in a class. i also do not like change. i don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. i try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes i feel it is harder than normal. i spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. i have so much to thank for but i feel that i am always asking g-d to help me in a situation. i enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. i enjoy school and friends. i feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. i had a very rough summer due to the fact that i had irritable bowel syndrome. it was very painful and i did not like the pain. a doctor prescribed me some medication. what upsets me is that one of my friends i feel is rude at times. i feel this because last night he was rude when i went to his room and he started yelling that i was disturbing his speech. i continue to be nice to him. i am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. he can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. i feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. sometimes i'm angry at him and sometimes i'm not. sometimes i feel sorry for him and sometimes i don't. i walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. the fraternity buys all his children gifts for christmas and i think it's nice. sometimes i feel sorry for him. he is a nice man. i also feel sad sometimes because i wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. i do not get along with him very well. sometimes i get very upset thinking about it. i often thank g-d that i have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. i miss my dog. he is so cute. i didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. usually i hear him barking when i am on the phone with my parents, but i have not heard him recently. when i visit home in a couple of weekends, i would like to spend a little time with him. he is a very nice and loving pet. he is old but still wild. i hope my girlfriend comes home with me. she said she would. her father is coming up to austin on thursday and we are going to dinner with him. this makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? i think. i miss my family. they are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. i hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. i have not given my id to anyone. i will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. maybe i won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. i will see. i hope to watch melrose place tonight. i have a lot of homework but i hope to watch it anyway. i have a lot of reading to do and i hope i complete. i think i will or come very close to it. i sometimes do not feel 100 percent. right now i am getting a little tired. i think i might nap after lunch. i think we are having steak today. i usually think of steak for dinner but i guess it is okay. yesterday i read for a long time. i didn't get as much reading done as i would of liked, but i am trying to keep up and i understand most of the information in the readings. i have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. maybe i won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. i would get a lot done because no one would be here. i am more tired now. i hope today's classes go fast and i have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! i hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. she is truly my best friend. guy or female -- i think she is my best friend. another best friend is my friend traylyn. he is nice and i have known him since third grade. i am probably going to pray later today. i was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so.

"the light above my computer is shining so brightly onto the screen. the bright light, almost blinding as i try not to look straight into it. my mind works rapidly as i am trying to focus on my thoughts. whenever i actually try to think of something my head seems to go blank and i can think of nothing. i guess i don't really think of nothing because the brain is working all the time. there is always some sort of idea or made up story in my head. when i am alone, such as when i walk to class i always daydream about fictional stories or ideal occurrences that i would want to happen in my life. then i worry that since i thought of it, it would never actually happen like that. i do not believe we can predict the future. unless dreams are a prediction. usually my dreams predict nothing and just are a picture in my head of the things i have been thinking about most often. sometimes they are ridiculous and make absolutely no sense but that could be our imaginations working. i don't seem to get very much sleep. i wonder if that is bad because i am not resting enough and do not have as many chances to dream. i think dreaming is healthy and so much fun when you have a good, inspirational one. our minds our so interesting. why do they work the way they do? will this question ever be answered? why are people the way they are? it is so interesting to analyze people and their actions but many times i cannot comprehend why they think and act the way they do. such as when they focus on all the unimportant aspects of life that really have no meaning. it is so special when i can actually find a person that i have a good conversation with. i left all my friends like that and am searching for those people here in austin. they have to be somewhere, considering there are thousands of people here. those conversations that leave you feeling in the best mood with a huge smile on your face are the best ones. when you've realized you've shared something amazing with that person or when you were just able to really understand what each other were thinking. those are the people that leave an impact in my life. those are the people that moved far away from me and are only reachable by a long distance phone call. these amazing friends are irreplaceable and i am only hoping to find people that come close the type of people i have known. this was something i was kind of worried about when i came here. would i be drawn into the bubble of people's lives that move in a cycle with no positive direction at all as to who they are going be? will i be strong enough to keep my attitude, hopes, and feelings about the person i am or want to be? i have found direction, the getting there is the problem. i am actually listening to the song patience right now and i think it has a good message. this song makes me sad every time i listen to it. it is tied to such strong memories and now especially because i have left many of the people i love. it is hard when i think about this person. i miss them so and my body aches when i think about not seeing them for such a long time. this is maybe one of the hardest parts about college: the fact of moving on and leading a new life with out the people you have loved for so many years. maybe, but my time is up now, and the rest of my thoughts will only exist in my mind.

"everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. even though i am polite and nice. i consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. so i don't see what the problem is. so far, the first 2 1'2 weeks of school, i have not yet to meet a nice girl. i don't know what's wrong. it is sort of making me depressed. during orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. so far, i still hang around my friends that i had during high school. i want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. i hope the meetings at fsa and vsa will aide me in meeting new people. the parties here are pretty cool though. i just wish they played different music. my neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. the girls on my floor are also hard to approach. i don't know if it's me. maybe i'm thinking too much. the time i spend here seems to go by so fast. i get homesick quite often. i want to go back to houston. maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. i haven't been spending quite as much money as i planned to spend. so far i have spent probably around 30 bucks a week. which is average i guess. my classes so far has been good. i just hate oversleeping. right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. college is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me.

"i feel stressed,tired and kind of anxcious like i have so much to do and not enough time to do it in. i am wondering what i really want to do in life and if i will be successful in life. i wonder how i will do in school and if i will make it through four years of school. i am thinking of my boyfriend, he goes to prarie view a&m and i miss him a lot. i wonder what he is up tp right now and i want to talk to him because i miss him. i am thinking how sleepy i am and how much i want to go to sleep. i am trying to work and think of all the other things i still need to. i miss my other friends and i am wondering if they are having as much stress as i am. i really want to go to bed but every night that i go to bed i feel like i have a lot to do that i have not yet finished. i have a lot going through my mind and it confuses me because sometimes i think i don't now what i really want out of life. i get very afraid that i will not succeed in life. i want to make my parents proud and happy but i also want to be happy myself but i am not totally sure what i really want out of life. i always thinl about how i don't want to be a dissapointment. i don't want to fail but i don't know if i am strong enough to succeed.

" right now i am sitting in my room. my tv ison and i'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. i have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as ut does. right now i'm here in my dorm room, it kind of smells like b. o. , but i think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up the mess that my room-mate and i have made. the tv is on right now and it's kind of distracting but i'm not going to say anythign because i would consider that rude. is it bad that i put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth i really don't care what others think about me. all i care about is what i think of myself, and whether i'm happy with myself or not. at this point i'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. i miss it though. i really don't think that i was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. is it bad that i don't like school?i know that it's only going to benefit my future and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. people don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. it does not cost anything to dream. i'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. i'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. i think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. i set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then i have a total break down. i feel as though i am a failure and i probably will not amount to anything. if you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. i'm sure that by now you can tell that. i'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. i'm very much more comfortable with a 35:1 ratio classes. i'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a b i would say a but that goes back to my really high standards. instead of being dissappointed i would rather achieve something that i know that i can probably complete. i think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. i will always wonder if i was ever able to fufill that a that i wasnt but never really went for. does this make me a bad person? i think not. i'm really considering going to a university back home. i'm here in the college of fine arts in the dance department. what can you really do with a bfa in dance? i'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? there goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. i think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. i'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. i understand that ut isn't a specialized conservatory in the arts, but if you are going to offer a major in dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. i am really considering majoring in psychology with a minor in dance. the university back home, university of the incarnet word, offers a minor in dance and a major in psychology which sounds like the perfect program. i was also thinking about mass media. i was thinking about being a talent agent. i need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. i'm not sure what that is right now.

"i met this guy mark thursday and today we had breakfast together. i really like him, but i don't know how to express myself around him. i get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. i have a nervous tick in my stomach when i think of him, like now. i feel like calling or emailing him, but i can't find the guts to. at breakfast, it took my five minutes before i could stop shaking. no one noticed but i could feel my knees quiver. school is not exactly what i thought it would be. there is so much reading, and i don't know if i'm absorbing it all into my brain. so many fun things to do, i make myself sit and read. i try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. i try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but i suffer as much failure as i do success. i have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and i'm lucky if i get the times and meeting places correct. i guess that's why i bought a cool ut planner which i carry with me everywhere! my mom was the same way i am. she procrastinated more in college than i am and did very well. i don't want to fail. i think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and i zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. i miss the familiar faces and places of port lavaca. i miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. tears come to my eyes. i haven't cried in a very long time, not even when i came back from the long labor day weekend. when i talk on the phone with my parents i swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. i want to succeed here and i'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. as a little girl, i came to many ut football games. my dream was to be a student here. considering i was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. i love the university and i'm glad i choose ut over southwest texas. southwest does have the best speech pathology program in the state, but i can not see myself anywhere, but here. when i think of that the sadness goes away, but i'm still left with an incredible amount of work that i am trying to accomplish. my dad works very hard. he only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. i can't tell if he likes work. he almost hates his sister's husband. i don't like him either. a total jerk and i feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. i think my dad is happy. he always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. he loved it. he was an average student in high school, most likely had add or adhd. we've always been close, but sometimes i feel like he disregards my feelings. we're both athletic, but i got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and i, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. i hope he knows i love him very much.

" here we go. i don't think my typing can keep up with my thoughts. the palm reader said a few weeks ago, that i was very mentally busy. anyways, this red hot chili peppers is pretty good, although i don't like that cabron song. i wonder if you get penalized for not writing as much. should just take the easy way out and claim i am a slow typer. so this is what college is like. doesn't seem so bad right now. i heard the first year was easy. this class could be a little tough, but the professor seems to know what he is doing. i wish i could type without making mistakes. that would be cool. i wonder if lisa will call me today. we seemed to really hit it off the other day, and she does seem interested. i wonder if that is just her personality to be really nice or what. hard to tell if she has a lot of other guy friends or not. my roommate got back quickly from houston already. kind of pathetic only going for one night to see his girlfriend. i don't know why that makes me upset, i guess because she is still is high school and he talks like a moron when he calls her on the phone. back to lisa as usual. i can't believe she likes all the same music as me. i wish there were some concerts coming up this month to go to. i don't know what there is to do for a date without a car. especially since we are not the party types. twenty minutes is ridiculous. it has only been 6 right now, and i am spent. oh well, glad to get this done with. i have a feeling the studying and assignments and what not are going to be piling up soon. is that how you spell piling? doesn't really look right, but whatever. i'm kind of curious what the next page says about what i have writen. i should finish my reading today, that should only take a little while. here comes my favorite song on the cd. i wonder if they will release it to the radio. i bet the next page says something about if you don't capitalize your words correctly, you are this type of person. this email writing and aol instant messenger has left me with some bad habits. oh well, no big deal. i don't really the red hot chili peppers that much. kind of too much funk in their music for me. it sounds good, but their lyrics are a little shaky. i'm really glad i got these headphones though. i hope calculus tests aren't that hard. the ta seems really nice, and hopefully he will know what is going to be on the test. i still don't think the teacher knows what he is doing. we're up to 11 minutes. not bad. lisa. can't believe how this is working out. i wish i remembered more about her from elementary school. i'm kind of worried about her being smarter than me. it shouldn't be a problem, i guess i'm not used to it. makes me think i have to act smarter around her. not smarter but smart. she doesn't get in to that intellectual stuff that much. kind of crazy, i think about this girl like i have known her for a long time, and also that we are dating. i think what i said constitutes as a date proposal. we'll see pretty soon i guess. i don't like how i say i guess all the time. it's in my im's all the time. got to mix it up a little bit. 5 more minutes to go. i wonder how long the average one of these is. 500 kids in one class is huge. there were at least 6 people from my high school in there. god this is getting lame. the writing lady went to northwestern. kind of cool my best friend is going there for journalism. much better than arizona state or wherever economics lady is from. wonder where pennebaker went to school. can't tell from looking at him, had to be in the east though. probably isn't the best plan to do this while listening to music. kind of affects your thoughts alot. especially rhcp, they say some messed up stuff. the new cd is good though. they have kind of mellowed out. i wonder if i will see them when they tour. kind of an expensive ticket. but it would be cool to say that i've seen them. well looks like we are ending ",0
"i'm busier than a one legged man in a butt-kicking' contest! i heard some statistic about how much college kids watch tv and i can honestly say that the only tv i've watched since i've been here is the football game because i haven't had enough time. i have a job, i'm in air force rotc, i'm in a fraternity, and i'm on a couple intramural football teams. i have all of this to do after studying and doing homework. i don't think that i feel really stressed about anything, of course no grades have come out yet, but physically its very demanding. one day in rotc i threw up 4 times as a result of probably being out of shape, but for the next week i just felt sick to my stomach. some of that might have something to do with the food in jester being the greasiest, most repetitive food i've ever eaten. also, i've lost 10 pounds since i've been here which disturbs me cause i used to work out every day and it sucks now that i can't. another subject that is scaring me is money. my parents pay for college, but i didn't realize how much id already be spending. my dad always told me to limit myself to a monthly budget, but of course i didn't listen to his advice and now i might be paying for it. literally. my class load isn't that bad except for calculus. this damn class is kicking my ass. first of all, my professor doesn't speak english very well, but sometimes that doesn't even matter because in a class of 150 students he refuses to wear a microphone or even speak up so that anyone beyond the first three rows can hear him. and when we can hear him he speaks in some sort of math language so that when i take notes i'm sure that when i look at them later i will of thought that they were notes from some ancient egyptian hieroglyphics class or something. so classes are going well!, now socially i have been having lots of fun. i've been lucky enough to meet a lot of girls but not smart enough to not date so many. i'm pretty sure i have a problem of leading girls on. for example there is this one girl who i've been hanging out with who i think ones to get a little more serious with me. now i'm just a freshman and i don't want to get serious with anyone yet! but if i try to conspicuously avoid her (i still call and am nice to her, i just don't go to her house or anything) she, like most girls, pick up on that almost instantaneously, then she tries to make me feel guilty for say not coming to see her or something. along with that there are some other girls who i've been talking to or seeing at parties. i guess you could say that i've been casually dating around, but next week there is this huge party and i'm really looking forward to it, but not to the awkward feeling of seeing all of these girls together at the same time because i'm sure all of them are going to be there. oh well!! i still love college.

"i am watching an episode of mad tv and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest ' alterboy thing, singing nelly's """"hot in herre"""". the whole thing makes me sick when i think about it. my desktop died on me while i was up at ut and i am shopping for a new computer. the soonest i could get one would probably be christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and i would never see it. but it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. at least i still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 10 pounds, but i chose it and paid for it. all in all, life on the computer side just sucks. i wrote this during labor day long weekend, so i just sitting here at home in houston until tomorrow when i go back to austin for a long haul, as i call it where i don't go back home until another holiday'long weekend. but i don't mind, i really enjoy living in austin, although the dorm i live in sucks due to construction noises. i have late classes on tth and i don't get up until like 11, but i still am awakened by construction at 10 or so. even though i didn't know my roommate until i move in with him, i do not regret going potluck. he is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and i do the same for him. he has early classes on the same days that i do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and i don't bother him when i wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as i do. so that is cool. it's an oddity that i am writing this, for i do not really know how to write papers. so i decided to write this like i would for my blog on livejournal, like i am writing to my best friends. when i get back to austin, i need to get my calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. sadly ii feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at ut, into my freshman year. but the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but i will have to just get used to that aspect of ut.

"it started out kind of good because school hadn't started. all i had to worry about was relaxing, working out, and enjoying life. now, another variable, school, has been injected into the equation. i realize that it is a necessary evil because without it, i can never advance in life. hopefully, one day i can work only when i want to work. until then i will try to make the best of my life and enjoy every day like it was my last. you know, i should start my mission statement right now. i have also been wanting to put together a compilation of my own philosophies so that i would have a road map to live my life. i wish it were that easy. anyway, here i am revealing how my mind works. it is kind of like a release to me. i should do this more often. recently, i have been thinking a great deal about my own shortcomings. these include my limited ability to speak, my limited athletic ability, and my the fact that i am not as charming and smooth as i want to be. part of me wants to admit these shortcomings and accept it. the other part of me says i should always keep a positive outlook and refuse to accept these traits. i am at a point in my life where i don't know if i can ever fully improve this. as much as i would like to, it seems that i have hit a plateau and maximized my potential. but i guess i have to keep hope. moving on to other subjects, i wonder if i will ever find a woman to spend the rest of my life with. relationships require so much work, more than i may be willing to put in. this bothers me because i don't want to be 60 years old and lonely. sometimes i realize that having faults, emotions and feelings is part of the price i have to pay for being a human.

"there are many things that have been bothering me lately. i feel as if i have been betrayed by those that should be absolutely loyal. it is sad that people must always interfere in the things that make you happy. it is as if other people sense when you are content and are trying to steal your happiness out from under you. i have made many new friends that i know will be there for me for many years to come. i feel as if i am part of a sacred family that always supports and protects those that it calls its own. well, that family has just been defiled by the actions of one. even though i am not perfect myself, by any means, i always try to do my best when it comes to keeping promises. i am afraid to see what may come of this action. the consequences could be severe indeed if we are found to be guilty of this false accusation. i do not understand what could possess another person to want to place his family in jeopardy just for the sake of conversation. i am deeply saddened by this recent turn of events and i hope and pray that everything will work itself out and that my family will survive and be able to grow into the future. i am prepared to accept the consequences of the actions of my brothers; that is what makes us a family. we have already grown beyond the notion of selfishness and are prepared to assist our family members in any situation, even if it means that we will suffer greatly for actions that were not ours to commit. this new family means the world to me. after leaving my home i felt alone and afraid until i found a group of friends so loyal and so trustworthy that i immediately felt at home again. i will do anything to see that my new family is not harmed or defiled in any way. i believe that it is necessary to have a strong support group to succeed, not only as a student, but as a human being. i am prepared to lay down my selfish tendencies for the good of my family. it is the least i can do. i love my new family as much as my old family. i refuse to see it be destroyed.

"well, i am now officially writing my first college paper"""" more or less. it is really hot outside today. i wonder when it is going to cool of so i won't swear so bad when i walk to class. i think that i need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when i get them, instead of putting them off. it makes me feel like i am bogged down when i have a lot of stuff to do at once. it is actually really stressful. i kind of like this song that is on the radio. busta rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper, but i think that this song is ok. pharrell really makes this song what it is. now come to think of it. i don't think that busta rhymes sang that song. oh well i guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes, so i won't correct my mistake. my chair is pretty comfortable. hopefully i will do my homework in it when i am done with this writing assignment. the longhorns really kicked new mexico state's butt. i think that chance mock (the quarterback) got to a ruff start, but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the longhorn's quarterback. although vincent young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal, scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts, and throwing a great 60 yard pass, i believe that mock should continue to start as qb because he has put in his time as scout team player. my, that was a really long sentence. i am tired of eating the food at the jester food court. they have a big selection, but the selections never change at each station. i kinda miss my mom's home cooking. i can get over that. i was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus, but i guess that i didn't think that i would see so many people going to class everyday. i kind of feel like a minority in austin. coming from a small town in east texas that is mostly white, black, and mexican, i am not used to seeing so many asian students. i am not against asian people at all, i just have never seen so many at one setting such as ut. the temperature in my dorm is not to my liking. i am a very hot natured person, and i prefer that it be cold in my room. being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling. i dislike sweating when i sleep. i need to go to the gym today. i am getting out of my routine of working out each day. i need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play. it is kind of hard to be disciplined once you don't have your parents to tell you what to do. the experience at ut is a good one though and i am not complaining. the only thing i dislike about it right now is that i still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks. the co-op did not have my mis book today like that re-order said. nothing is ever perfect. that is not a bad thing though. i hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy czar. this is an easy grade. there are so many fine girls here at ut. everywhere you look you see a hottie. i love that. some of them seem fake to me though, but i know that i shouldn't judge people. my phone is ringing and i am almost done. alright i am done. later.

"tired, stressed, already sick of school and it has only been the first week. what can i say other than i have to do great this semester. i never knew that school would be this stressful. there are so many things going on in my life right now that i really do not have time for. i feel like my brain is on overload and don't know when i am going to get all of this stuff done. hungry, what can i say, i am always craving something. i am sitting in my dorm room all alone because my friends have all gone out to this sig ep party and i opted to stay home and catch up on things that i need to get done. i hate typing too. although typing is a lot easier to do because it is a lot faster. i just hate it when i mess up and hit the wrong key. it really irritates me when my phone rings late at night and it is one of my friends from home and you can't understand a word they are saying because they have been out partying all night long. have you ever noticed that when people have had a little too much to drink that they get real emotional? when i returned home last night from being out, one of my friends from home was hysterically crying over something a guy said to her at a party. he commented on what she was wearing and obviously she took it the wrong way and got mad. of course i knew it was no big deal, but she really thought it was. this morning, of course, she ran into my room wondering what had happened last night and why she got upset. it was such a big deal last night, but this morning she was so embarrassed. i have done the same thing that she did. gosh, i miss my parents and i never really thought that i would. my senior year i was so tired of the high school scene. i think i was the only one of my friends that hated my senior year. well, i can't say that i absolutely hated it, but i was ready to go on to bigger and better things. my boyfriend lived here, so maybe that's why i wanted to leave home so badly. my phone bill is going to be so high this semester. i talk to all of my friends so much on the phone. i also talk to my parents a lot too. i especially talk to my mom. i was always so close to my mom and it is hard to be away from her. i could always drive home one weekend. it is not very far away. i just found out today that we are going to have to go to ten hours of study hall every week. it sounds bad, but i really think this is good for me especially coming into my freshman year and trying to get adjusted to this new life that i am leading now. i was always independent, but now i feel that i am on my own for good. i really like only depending on myself for things.

"i don't know what exactly i am supposed to write about. and i think about how much time i spend trying to perfect everything in my classes, but when does that ever go through. i think that there is so much to do and i have no time to do it it. the stress keeps growing and growing. i am a bad typer so this won't be as long as it should be biut i don't really care i keep fixing my mistakes even thoigh i know i am not supposed to i thik that my hand will start to hurt really soon after so much typeing that i am going to inevitablly have to take a break soon but i ll just keep going psy seems to be an interesting courseso far and i am looking forward to listening to some of the lectures. thinking' i don't know what else i am supposed to type about so i am going to write words that don't mean anything to me i miss my mom and my family and i miss my exboyfeind even though we had a bad breakup, i don't know if this is approriate for this assigninment or not but i sometimes i think that my thoughts go in weird directions and i think abnormal thoughts that people don't usually think about but then again i am just another teenager who is full of life and evenerygy anf i i someimtes wish that my teenage days were over and i could then setlle down and do something useful with myselfv but i love being young i wouldnt give this up for the world and to know that in a couple of years i am going to be off doing sothing that will whats the word i am looking for effect, thats it, the rest of my life and the way that i live and the people i will be freiends with and the people i will work for what exactly do i have to do to make things work out for me' what exactly do i have to prove to people to show them that i deserve respect and a good life' i think this typing is a waste of my time because i am not even getting anything done and i have so miuch reading to do and i have better things to do than to type this and no one is even going ot read this it angers me that i have to spnend 20 mins on something no one is even going to look at there are about 600 people in my class and i doiubt anyone will know who i am for a long time f even ever. i wish that i never sined up for this classs as a freshman. i wish i could go home and not be stuck in a place like this and i wish things could change for me. i don't know how i am supposed to think about the way i think. i think thats stupid no one understans fully how the brain works. no one will ever understand the way i work and i wish they would all stop trying. i live my life for everyone else iu thats wrong, but i can't ever live up to any expectauions and it upsets me. i will most likely grow up to become a psyco! thats all. i'm stopping now. jennifer nguyen ",1
"so here i am sitting at my computer. i am supposed to be doing my homework that i put off all week, i guess you could call this homework though. its a little cold in here, i haven't taken a shower yet. i hope my roommate doesn't just come home and i'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. i wish i could go home to see my family and friends. but i don't have the money. i hate my job. i wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe i'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. i'm hungry and my feet are cold. i wonder why it is that whenever i get hungry i get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever i get cold i get hungry. i don't think the second floor dining opens until 4:30, if even that, i can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. i really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since i dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time i get them, or were sent earlier in the day. i should really take a shower, i feel sticky. i think its from the ice cream. i just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day i might think about that, but today i've got bigger things to worry about. i like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which i think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. i would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. i wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. i mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday i was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than i did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so i said something, and it wasn't even mean, i just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. i couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, i hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. i think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. i know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. i couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time i get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did i buy two packs of gum? i went to wal-mart yesterday and for whatever reason i bought two packs of gum. i don't' even chew gum that often. maybe i bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, i think she was catching the 3pm bus out of san antonio. i'm going home next weekend. i'm supposed to catch a bus at 4 and get to dallas at 7:45. i guess we'll have to make some stops because i've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 3 hours. but i probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. i told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on friday, sat, or sundays because i didn't know when i was going out of town. and what did he do? schedule me for this friday. well i already bought the tickets and if i don't go home this weekend i'm going to go crazy. i miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. i miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. i got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. i don't talk to him anymore. i wonder if he even knows i'm here. samantha knows, i remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. i mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it i can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this? it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and i haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me? i don't know. well i should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening.

"i'm always the last one to know he said. i know the feeling. what can i do to reach you? you can know anything he said. but i didn't ask- i didn't know how. and is the offer still there? are we ready to take it? we've passed being ready. we never had a real beginning or middle- just skipped into this end? i want to slip into reverse. where is our beginning? did it die when we said i love you? you make it too powerful- i make it romantic abandon. i was afraid. i think i'm losing you- and i don't know how to fight that. i'm not sure i really know what we mean. . maybe i was wrong for holding back- but you held back too- we both did. let us lie together and hold one another and love. i look at you. looking at me. seeming wonder- take your hat off. smile at me through the cracks in your skin. why do i get this feeling that in the course of my life i will have to become a queen of letting go-? . . a master. an expert- flawless mover. mask of beauty. horror. what is real? i know. got me a name- but names change. have this face. so do they sometimes. still, here i am. can close my eyes. learn to fly. far away- to someplace where faces are real. no gunk to cover 'em. no baggage to smash 'em. i am only as free as i really want to be. as i allow myself to be- freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose- you go janis baby- i don't remember the last time i was free. security. a face is security. can be. lie down- daydream. sleep things off- give it time, start over. i'm so lonely. need to find someplace in myself- tap into my soul and dig out the pain. you dwell on answers without thinking and lose yourself temporarily- what is the answer? hey didn't you know that 42 is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? bet on that 42- whatever 42 is. go with it- run with- and try not to think too hard about the way you see him- the way they curve in your mind- try to fill the empty space beside you with movement- try not to stop and then you won't miss. but that's not true. the talmud had it right- we do not see things as they are, we see them as we are. and that is the sole truth- even when we think we cannot see ourselves.

"stream of consciousness as i sit behind this bleak, gray screen, i find myself wanting to yank my dirty blonde locks of hair right out of their follicles. sure, so far college has been a lot of fun. why doesn't this program allow me to scroll down to the next line without pushing """"enter""""? am i supposed to keep on typing without pushing """"enter"""" until i hit some kind of barrier and can't type anymore? well, i'm going to operate on the assumption that i should make my own right margin. back to being completely stressed, i have so many things that i have to do right now, that is, before tomorrow. so, why the heck am i doing this assignment when i have until the 12th to turn it in? i guess that's my nature. i tend to want to do the """"fun"""" things first. if my mother could see me now, she would freak. i wonder what would happen if i got my upper ear pierced? i bet my mom would kill me. she nearly freaked out when i had my belly button pierced. i feel extremely guilty for having done that behind her back, but i feel even more guilty for upsetting her and ruining my innocence in her eyes. my roommate wants me to pierce her ear for her. i honestly don't think that i am capable of inflicting that kind of pain on another individual. sure, i can pierce my own bellybutton, but when i see another person in pain, i feel twice as bad as they most likely do. oh well, i'll just give tracy the money to go have it professionally done. this pushing """"enter"""" is really beginning to frustrate me. i keep typing way over the right limit and having to erase and go back and re-type what i already typed. i think i need a computer. i hate having to work and concentrate amongst all the hundreds of other people here at the smf (the smurf. i smile everytime i hear that). i wanted to buy a computer, and i do have the money since i sold my motorcycle, not by my own choice, but by my mothers. i realize that was a run-on sentence, but i'm not about to go back and fix it. i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this or not. i'm just glad that i haven't had any demented thoughts since i have started typing. not that i have those often, but we all have certain weird thoughts that we really don't care to admit having. at least, i hope so. i bet whoever reads this is going to think that i'm a bad person. i'm really not. i like to think of myself as daring and thrill seeking. my mother likes to think of me as unconventional and improper and borderline ignorant. so, here i am at ut to prove her wrong. i've taken a step in the right direction by joining a sorority. i think that should be fun as long as i can stay on the good side of the girls in the sorority. it has been my experience that after anyone has known me for a long enough period of time, they grow tired of my companionship and toss me aside like yesterday's trash. this is one of the most confusing and hurtful things in my life. i don't understand it. i think i'm the nicest person that i know. i'm always willing to do things for others to make them happy. i'm a great listener, and i put everything i've got into everything that i do (friendships especially). i've been told that things will change and that things will get better in college. so far, i've found that to be very true. i've met so many wonderful people that i can't wait to know better, but the first 18 years of my life has me trained to wonder how long it will be before they drop me. oh well. my twenty minutes is almost over with and i have successfully typed myself into a foul mood. i really hope no one reads this. i'm going to leave the smurf, go back to castilian and enjoy being with my new friends while they still like me!

"i keep thinking about this white stripes song and i cannot remember the name of it so i can download it. it continues to anger me. its really dark in here so i should open the blinds, but i think right now there is a glare through a window and that would not be good since my computer faces it. just a minute ago my keyboard was making me really mad. it would freeze up and i couldn't type certain letters. it made me so mad. i wonder what ben is doing right now. he wasn't online but i know he doesn't have to work today so i am curious what he is doing. i called him earlier today and then when i got out of school. i really miss him and i am glad i get to go home next friday. i also miss my dog, rosie. i wonder if she thinks about me or maybe thinks i am dead or something. mom said she looked for me a little bit. i can't believe my credit card got denied. that makes me so mad since mom sent the check like a week and a half ago. i wonder if i can get on the website and look at my balance. dad is such a cheap guy. i can't believe that he thinks i can live on $250 a month. i guess i could but that would mean i couldn't buy everything i want and since mom isn't here to take me shopping and buy stuff for me, i have to buy it for myself. i just got back from walgreens and i am also getting really mad because my car is really dirtier every time i get in it. there is bird crap all over it since it is under that tree. i kind of like the spot and the shade, just not the crap. i wonder when i will start to feel better. i need to take that medicine. i can't stop coughing now and i couldn't in class either. i bet it made the people around me hate me. it feels weird to have already eaten dinner at 6:30. it kind of sucks that they serve it from 5 to 6:30 because i am used to it at like 7:30. the food here is not all that great but there is a better variety than mom makes. i am so excited about going home next weekend and sleeping in my double bed. it is really hard to get used to sleeping in a twin when i usually sprawl out all over the double. my bed also has that poofy thing that needs to flatten out because it makes it harder to sleep. bennett borrowed one of my scarves today and that also made me mad. i don't mind that she borrowed it but i really wished she would have asked first. some of her clothes are really ugly i think. i don't know i guess that is what you get coming from podunk, tx. i like her a lot but i just feel like she thinks she is hot stuff and it also pisses me off that she rushed and i didn't. i really would like to know how someone like her was accepted and i wasn't. i'm not saying that she is gross or anything. i just think that i should have gotten into a good one also. it makes me mad and disappointed and upset all at the same time simply because i always pictured myself being in a sorority and i never expected rush to go that way at all. it kind of hurts even worse since everyone on my hall has all of the decorations and all of that stuff. claire also made me mad last night when she started eating all of my goldfish and stuff. i have so much homework to do and all i want to do is go to sleep. i feel awful because my nose is running and my throat and ears hurt, plus i keep coughing. i wonder if it is just allergies or if i actually have a cold. mom said she would make an appointment with dr. eldredge when i go home so that he can see me if i need him to. i really like him a lot more than dr. audrey because he isn't psycho and he is really young. that makes me think of paschal and fort worth because his office is down that way. man i really want to go to ol south. i really am kind of homesick. i have been trying not to think about it because it makes me really sad. i think i miss rosie and mom the most. i miss ben but i am beginning to think that we are not right for each other. the other night when we went to those frat parties i was thinking that i don't know if i can do it or not. i am not sure whether i am missing him or missing the attention and also i know that we are not really in love and i don't see myself loving him. i really miss what eric and i had and i think that is really the only relationship that i have been in where i was in love. i think eric is mad at me because i called him the other day and he never called me back. i wonder if things would have ended up differently if he had gone to school or even had a better career path than he does. i really miss him but i don't think i could do the long distance thing with him any better. plus, i know there were things wrong with him too. i really wish i could combine the traits of both people i like and make a boyfriend specified to my desires. i bet everyone does. i can't believe how tired i am. i wish i could just go to bed right now. maybe i will take some tylenol pm. although that didn't help me at all last night. everyone is gone to their sorority meetings now so i think i am the only one here. oh

"adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in """"having a good time"""" have all been fairly easy to get used to. meeting new people has been exciting and the """"name game of trying"""" to remember everyone i have met has been a challenge. this labor day weekend i saw the huge different between high school and college as i decided to take a road trip with three other friends to galveston, a popular labor day hangout. i don't know if it was the college parties that made the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. one thing is for sure those times are over and getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. this weekend has also showed me that i am a very patient person. my roommate paul has shown this to me. having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. if i am still sane at the end of the year i think that i will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with paul. i feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. o, i almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 4. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. basically i hope to work hard and play hard.

" so i think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete. it gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads. i probably don't realize some of the things that i think. maybe after looking at this i will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling. i smell food. i just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more. i have this weezer song in my head. i don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head. i hope it gets out fast because it is annoying. my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it. that would hurt. never have i done so much reading as i have done this past week. it is annoying. i do not enjoy reading much. oh well. i guess i have to do it anyway. my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light. the apartment is nice. i get my own room and it is very spacious. i hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock. its bugging me and i think its a result of me typing. yep. i stopped and the ticking stopped. i think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on. how ironic maybe. interesting. it stopped. they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore. ill be right back sorry. blanked out for a second. the days seem to go by very fast. the weekends go slow however. i like the weekends. this weekend should be great because i will go hoome for the labor day holiday. seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy. greek mythology has too many names to remember even a quarter of them. its very a nnoying. how many times have i said annoying in my train of thought. a good nap would be nice right now. i like that painting of the melting clocks. its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good. i wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars. its just not worth it to me. i am a very economical person when handling money. sometimes its good and bad. a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though. cooking. i need to start cooking more things. sure the microwave is awesome but i need to expand my cuisine. iron chef. funny show. iron chef should fight emeril. i wonder who would win. they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on emerils show when he says those things. it will give it an old school flavor. flavor is good. does water have a flavor. is the flavor water. who cares its good when you're thirsty. i just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade. because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff. or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars. ill look into it. my mouth is dry. i oculd actually go for some water right now. my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table. i wish i could fly. i just saw some birds flying. i wish i could do that. where would i go. i'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too. that would be awesome. today is the first day of the rest of my life. that quote always struck me as very cool sounding. is hould really start using my planner to right down what i need to get done. my memory doesn't serve me quite well. i want some of the energy arizona iced tea. i haven't had any for quite some time. i'm due for some. but i guess right now all i got is water. that will have to do. potpourri is such a weird word. but smells nice so i guess they are even. i bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought. it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much. this is one of the best writing assignments i've ever had to write because there is no structure. i am a poor writer. i should practice and get help. i probabloy won't though. ill just get by onw what i can do. it just isn't my thing. donde esta el biblioteca. i need to work on myh spanish to. hopefully i won't have to take a spanish class. that would piss me off. i can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter. it would take me too much time. i think tex mex will serve me just fine. bien bien bien. if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because i'm so itno righting this. i hope that doesn't happen ",0
"this semester should be one where i define the rest of my life. working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. it is what i have wanted to do for the past 5 years. the fact that i was initially rejected brought me down. but i can't let that hold me down. hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. my roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. i'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. i have known him for the past 2 years. i am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. i don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. i am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. hopefully something will come of it. if not there are about 20,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. i thought this was going to be easy but so far i just can't seem to talk about much. that it was i hate about myself is that i am too shy around people i don't know. people i don know think i am loud and very extroverted but around strangers i don't know how to initiate conversation. there are times though when i don't really care and i seem to make friends with everyone. i have a lot of reading to do but i thought i might as well get this out of the way. i used to do this type of thing in my 10th grade english classes. mr. wildman was so cool. my old high school wasn't very good. i guess that is why i only went there for 2 years. i bet there are about 2 million mistakes in this paper once i am done typing this. the psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. that is such a relief because i need to work as hard as i ever had in my entire life and i probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. i think that after this semester of busting my ass i t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 4. 0 over the next years will come natural. i believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. architecture is a field of tremendous work. i have worked with a guy for the past two years. it so good. i have learned more on the job than i think i will ever learn in any classroom. it was a job i was looking forward to going to every morning. he gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. i was able to organize the el paso independent school district fundraiser where i happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. how much longer do i need to type? this is lasting longer than i thought it would. i guess my head is just empty. i think while doing this i try to hard to put on this thing that i think you want to hear. but since it is just a free thought paper i should just be able to write whatever i want. but for some reason it just isn't happening. i think way too much about things that keep me up at night. i often lie in bed until 4 in the morning just thinking i will be in the next 10 years. i have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. i think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. just once to here my dad say, """"that's my son"""" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what i have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. hopefully i went let him down that is why i come to class. that is why i have to college. this is why i am reading and turning this assignment in days early. i will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. if i don't i have not only let myself down but my parents as well. but i won't let that happen. this is the place an time to make or break my future and i don't plan i on coming away from the university with anything less then i what i came here for. i will be the best and i will make my parents proud. time is almost up i thin. i guess this has been good for me. even though no one will probably ever read this i know it has been a vent. these are things no one has ever heard me say. so take car of it. times up teach, talk to you later.

"i'm thinking about bush and religion. i just had a simi arguement about it. i don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone. country music isn't that bad. i use to hate it in high school and now i've found a liking for it. tomorrow i go to nachadoches to visit friends. i'm looking forward to the driving and getting away from it all. i don't like being stuck down here. my room is really quiet. so is my roommate. we don't talk much. hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit. my legs itch and so does my back. i'm really full. that large pizza was really good. but the sight of pizza would make me really sick. i still can't stop thinking about government. it all just sickens me. i wish there were better canidates to choose from. face itches. i'm actually happy tonite. i got an a on my physics homework. ugh, physics was made by the devil, i swear. its like they don't want you to ever pass that class. leg itches. i'm a little stressed though. my shoulders and neck are all tight. i think its because of my whole financial aid deal. hopefully it will all be in by tomorrow so i can have some money for this weekend. arm itches. i really like country music. stomach itches. i miss old friends. maybe ill try to fix that this semester. get back in contact with old friends or try to stay in contact. i need to stop missing calculus class. its not like its hard. i just need to go and pay attention. i need to shave. i just need the time to do it. it takes forever. my chair is comfy. i don't like how my monitor is set-up. i wish i didn't have to turn my neck to look at the monitor. i wonder who is winning the patriots'colts game. i hope the colts win. i don't want to see the pats win anymore. i really like the underdogs, except when its ut playing. got to support the home team. astros finally lost a game. 12 straight and then a lose. hope they won the second game of the doubleheader. now i see why i people don't like country music, it puts you in a more mellow mood. not sad but not happy. more of a reflective mood. man, this summer was awesome. i can't wait til next summer. college intern at cypress united methodist. 200 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today. some people from the mission trip knew her. its so sad to be taken at such a young age. texas better beat arkansas saturday. ill be pissed if they lose again to them. i itch a lot. my beard especially. that's why i need to shave it. ugh, 8am class tomorrow. i thought freshman year was going to be the only year i had them. oh well, the class is easy and entertaining. i can't wait for this to be over. i really wish me and my roommate would talk more. it gets kind of akward in here when we are just sitting at our computers not talking to each other. i need to excercise. i'm feeling lazy. i want to play raquetball. it was great when i hit ash in the head with the ball and then when i fell on my butt when trying to serve. great times. my beard still itches. i think i'm going to go shave soon. its driving me nuts. this is a lot like writing in a journal. just a lot more random. but being random is fun, it throws people off.

"assignment 1 it is 12:00 am and my mind is very tired. it has been a very long and exhausting day, and i can't believe this is only the second day of class, i have a long way to go, hopefully ill be able to handle it. it seems as if i don't feel like thinking, my mind feels lazy as if it has been asleep this whole summer--i need to wake it up and make it start thinking again--like i did back in highschool. --or at least back before my senior year when i didn't really do much thinking at all. i hope tomorrow goes good and i am able to get all the stuff i need to get done. i'm kind of worried that i am not going to be able to manage my time while i'm here--like sitting here right now at midnight where no one knows where i am, kind of scares me. i have the freedom to do what i want now, and i hope i can still make myself do all the things i need to. i am also worried right now--walking back late at night by myself. it scares me to think of what might happen to me. but some things have to get done, and you just have to do them. i really would like to go to sleep right now, i think my tiredness is interferring with my ability to think about this writing assignment. maybe i should have waited until i was a little bit more awake. or maybe, i think better when i am tired. i don't know. my mind is blank right now, and i am feeling a little anxious that i am not writing what i need to be writing about,and that some how who ever is reading this will not give me credit because i didn't follow the assignment. i wish i could go home and sleep in my bed and my house, i am getting a little bit homesick. i already miss my family at home and all my friends. it gets lonely up here, when you don't really know to many people, sometimes i feel like i don't belong here and that what i am majoring in is totally wrong for me. i feel like i won't be able to handle calculus and some of my hard classes. but, i know i have to. i don't really have a choice right now--i have to at least finish out this semester and see how things go. i hope my roomate isn't worried about me, she left here about and hour ago and i told her i would be there in a little while. oh well, she probably just fell asleep or something. i am feeling kind of anxious right now--i don't think i like being here by myself--i don't know what it is. i feel anxious a lot--i should stop worrying about things so much. well the 20 minutes is up. the end ",1
"my computer is spiffy. i decided to name it mara, which means bitterness"""" apparently, but i was naming it after a character in the star wars books who is really cool. my computer gets in """"fights"""" with a friend's computer. we type to each other over aol instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other. she named her computer screwtape after a demonic character c. s. lewis developed. it's hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up, i'm on to a new thought. i'm also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because i hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes. however, i probably won't be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because i am typing so fast. one of my friends is iming me, but i can't respond because i have to do this for an entire 20 minutes. i'm only at 4 minutes 50 seconds right now. i guess i can keep him waiting. he is one of the best friends you could ever have. however, i'm having a little trouble right now because he and i are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and i know she still adores him completely. besides, i think they're much better for each other than he and i could be. he and i are both too proud and arrogant. she is proud, but she doesn't think she knows everything. she is pretty zany. i met her back in the 6th grade and we've been friends ever since. our friendship has had its ups and downs, but it has never halted. i just couldn't hook up with her ex-boyfriend because that would be tacky, at least for the next couple years. i know she had be really upset and i could never forget the way they were together. fortunately, i think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me. speaking of romantic interests, there's a boy who lives next door to me who's pretty attractive. however, i think a lot of girls are attracted to him, so i would have a lot of competition, and i don't like competition. he seems like a really nice guy, though i'm thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot. one of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party, and apparently he came. i was locked away in my room, attempting to study because i have a quiz and a test tomorrow (actually later today, since it is now after midnight). i wish i could find a guy who wasn't so emotionally messed up or low in the self-esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away. speaking of which, chris hasn't e-mailed me back. he and i got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation, though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going. so anyways, right now he is avoiding me. i wish he would talk to me, because he is one of the few people i trust to be honest, moral, and to steer me from harm. and i need to talk to a guy like that right now. i seem to attract guys who aren't particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people. the irony is, they like me, they tell me, because i'm so moral, pure, and sweet. someone's knocking at the door. it took only 30 seconds to answer it. my roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab. she is really cool, probably one of the best possible roommates i could have. she is quite eclectic. she likes to knit, particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy. if i have enough energy, i fidget during lectures. i used to play with a hacky sack in high school. some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it. it was cool, because my teachers trusted me. i even was friends with a few. i went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago. i'm going to miss them. speaking of which, i need to e-mail mr. karnavas, my former bible'philosophy'greek teacher.

"my week is catching up with me so my mind is somewhat numb from all of the information being presented to me. the fun and freedom that as a freshman are all too new to me are affecting my energy level and i am fighting the urge to sleep right now. although my body is so tired my desire to have fun and go out outweigh the lack of energy. as an extrovert my energy seems to come from other people no matter how tired i think i am. i love the newness of everything and hope that it lingers as long as possible. sometimes, though i long for the familiarity i have left behind. i almost avoid my photo album of my friends, boyfriend, and family. i miss the love which comes so naturally from them. its that level which takes so long to reach. everyone here i know at a shallow level. i constantly wonder who will be my best friends at the end of this year. who will be the ones i will reach that next level of friendship with? there are so many uncertainties about the future. with my boyfriend and i dating other people, i wonder if the miles between us are going to be a stronger force than our love. was backing off on the seriousness of our relationship a bad idea? i am having fun but he isn't and i really don't want to lose him. it was his choice, though, to go to the naval academy instead of coming to ut so it's his own fault he doesn't like it. my heart just aches for him though because i hate the thought that he isn't happy. i think that is what love is. it's when you hurt just as much as when the person you care about is hurting. it's when you'd do anything in your power to take away that hurt, putting there feelings in front of your own. love is so much more complex than that, but i believe this at least part of it. i think that when you know everything about a person, when all of their deep dark secrets are told, and you still are head over heels for the person, that is love. someone once told me we like because, we love although. i think what i have with mike is love, so these miles will either make us or break us for good. either way i just hope we will always be best friends. he knows me better than anybody and i guess that is a big part of the familiarity i miss.

"i have watching comedy central for the past hour or so. the program involved people getting paid not to laugh while listening to comedians. if i were one of those people paid not to laugh, i wouldn't pay attention to the actual words the comedians was saying. listening to the skit would most likely make me laugh, so i would think of something else. i would discuss with myself something really boring, so as not to laugh. speaking of boring, i received two letters today from my boyfriend. he was talking about being bored in class. he attends a&m, the idiot. my parents don't know he's my boyfriend. they think he's just my best friend since that's what we were all last year. my sister, whose computer i'm using, doesn't know either. i hope she doesn't read anything i'm writing here. if she did, i'm not so sure she wouldn't tell my parents. my mother loves my boyfriend, but i don't think she or my father would let me visit him at a&m if they knew he was more than just my friend. otherwise, i would love to tell them. they would be so happy for both of us, seeing as how they love him. i just want to be able to have him visit me and me visit him without my parents wondering why we're visiting each other. plus, my parents are quite protective. i don't know how their attitudes towards him would change if they knew. all of my past boyfriends have been introduced to them only after we became boyfriend and girlfriend. my past boyfriends were very different from my current boyfriend. their outlook on life, intelligence level, looks, interests, and families were exact opposites from his. he's exceptionally smart, and i'm not just saying that because he's my boyfriend. he loves einstein, his theories, and computers. my old boyfriends loved roller blading, and non-intelligent ways of spending an evening, if you know what i mean. my boyfriend actually listens when i talk to him. he will also talk if i ask him a question. he doesn't lie to me, which is a big change. in fact, we spend most of our time together just talking about differing interesting things. you would think we would run out of things to say, but there is always more. we've had these talks for at least nine months and still have more to talk about. i can actually see spending the rest of my life with him. i can't believe i just said that. i never thought i'd be able to say that about anyone. wow, i'm impressed. he's one of the closest things to my heart. it's weird actually talking about this. for the longest time, i didn't want anyone that close. now it's kind of comforting. oh boy, i have been typing for quite a while now. sorry. bye, and have fun reading this and delving into my soul.

i'm wondering how long it's going to take me to find a girl i really like and if girls look at me as cute or a skinny dork. i miss my dog and the country life i use to live in. i'm scared of not making the baseball team and not completing my goal of pitching in the majors. i'm pissed off at my parents for not getting me a new car for graduation. i'm wondering if people act like they're cool with me when i'm around and make fun of me when i leave. i wish i had perfect teeth so i wouldn't have to get braces. i'm wondering if i'll ever forget my first love and if she'll ever forget me. i wonder why people look down on pot smokers even though their parents probably did it. i wonder when i'm a upper classman if girls will want me more and if i'll look different. ,1
"welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. i don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. i can't recall ever hearing a song that i didn't like on kgsr. i think that i'll stay in austin this summer so that i can continue to listen to it. i really missed it last summer, when i didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do i. so back to the point, there isn't one, adi is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won't leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. lyle is not a man. she is the only girl i've ever met named lyle. adi will not stop talking about her, i don't know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all i have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. i honestly don't care, adi. i'm not lying, i know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to india. like tonight. i hate the commercials on kgsr though. which is why i keep a cd ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt sara, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, i think. that's really scary, since she's only 18, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and karen hasn't been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. jason has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since i never play computer games or do other things with them. i only check my email obsessively, although i usually don't ramble as much, unless i'm emailing my friend tara, who i tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as i've learned in past jobs. i've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. i usually sing whatever song is on my mind until i want to kill myself. (not really-which i should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all i can do is sing them over and over again. also i sometimes translate them into french. it always seems like i've accomplished something after i've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least i have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what i type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. i think i need to hear the new sundays cd, it sounds really good, at least the one song that i've heard from it. i haven't bought a cd in a few weeks now, my last one being an older poi dog pondering cd that i like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately i only have two minutes left. i wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. i know you can type longer, and i'd love to, except i have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that i have available. so now i'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 60,549. 58,47. 56,55,54,53. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only i couldn't really count down and type at the same time, i'll try again with the ten key. 60,590,58,57,56,55,545,53,52,52, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now i've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you.

"hmm. let's see. what to write about. since we're on the topic of psychology, i was in awe when i first walked into the auditorium the first day of class. there were more people in that room than in my entire graduting class last year. it was a pretty impressive sight, but also a bit omnious. so far i like my classes, but all of them are bigger than my highschool classes, but then again what am i supposed to expect with a school population of near 50,000 people as opposed to my 1700 high school population. man, i like this internet homework. this way you don't have to worry about keeping up with papers and the like. i used to loose most of my homework back in the day because i'm not that organized of a person. speaking of internet, you got to love this internet hookup in the dorm rooms. i like the fact that i can be in the internet and still have the phone line free. my parents used to hate when i'd tie up the phone line checking my e-mail. since all my friends went to different colleges, it's amazing how handy e-mail really is. i've already talked to a few of them using some aol instant messanger. it's kind of funny really, to see how many of your old high school friends keep in touch over the school year, or keep in touch at all for that matter. i've been in contact with some of my good friends, but also been surprised at not hearing from 1 or 2 close ones. i think i decided that i'm going back for our high school's homecoming on sept 17. supposedly a lot of my friends are going to, and i'd really like to see them. i'm also going back this next weekend (labor day weekend) seems that i forgot to pack a lot of stuff, or didn't even thing of stuff, that i ended up needing in college. i guess in a way it's kind of hard to pack for moving away, because you don't know exactly what you'll need until you get there. it must seem to you by now that i'm relating a lot of stuff back to high school. well don't go over analyzing it or anything, it's just what i'm basing a lot of my college experiences on so far. it's funny, i never had to read or study back in high school. it just sort of came to me naturally through teacher lectures. but here i'm actually having to adjust and take notes, read the book, etc. having to pull a 180 is weird, but i think i'm doing a good job so far. man, i hope my laundry's not done yet. i still have a few more minutes go to writing, but i just hate it when people put their stuff in the dryer or washer and leave, only to come back an hour later when there's a huge line forming to use it. heh, i guess i should start practicing what i preech, but i figure i've got tons of time to start doing that. most likely i'll start when i get out of schoo, get married, and have kids so i don't set a bad example. yeah, i eventually want to have kids, and i stress eventually. i've got so many good one liners that i've inherited from my parent's, along with a few that i thought up all on my own, that i can't wait to try out on my youngins. hmm, i seem to have a bit of a problem. i forgot when i started typing my mindless babbling. i think i still have a few minutes left. this assignment reminds me of a book i had to read last year in english. well, i didn't have to because i didn't, but we were supposed to. it was. a portrait of an artist as a young man. i remember it because the author used a lot of stream of conciousness in the book, which made it harder to follow and understand, thus less appetising to me to read. i did however, download the cliffs notes off the internet and read those, so i guess i didn't totally slack off. i just. took a shortcut. ok, i think my sentence is served, so i'm going to go check on my laundry.

"today has been a pretty good day. i am a little worried about my computer class because i can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. i am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. i wish my ex would call me just to check and see how i am doing. never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. i start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. hopefully i will make the team. that would be really cool, except if i made varsity somehow, i would miss my family. if i was on varsity i would get to travel a lot, all over the us, but i would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. i think college is harder than i thought it was going to be. but, the internet up here, the dsl i have at my apartment, is really fast. i downloaded some songs in like two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. my shoulders are hurting, and i am a little cold. i need some extra sleep. i shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up friday and saturday. i think i ate too much earlier, and now i am too full. well, i know i have a lot to do tonight. i have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. i took care of my pretesting last night so now i don't have to worry about it. i really need a neck and back massage. i miss talking to my grandma every night. i miss living with her too. college is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because i am responsible for more things than i use to be. i just miss the security i think i felt in high school. if i thought back, i'm sure i would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. but i need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing i can do if i don't want to end up living in a box on the street. i hope everything works out the way i always dreamed it would, and i hope i end up in a job that i love. i don't want to spend thirty years in a job that i hate. i would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. i would much rather be happy than rich. sometimes, though, i don't think that way. i know i am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. and what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. it is going to be hard on me when she dies. but i am not going to think of that now, because that is in the lord's hands, not mine. i wish dwayne would call me. why? why do i keep saying that? damn. that is why i am going to stay up here next weekend. if i stay up here, maybe, hopefully, i won't think about him as much. and, i will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. i have slacked off the past couple of days, and now i'm going to pay for it. especially tonight, i am hoping to get caught back up. i wish i could go to bed right now. i am cold. need to turn the thermostat down. maybe it would save some money if i didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. but, if i didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, i wouldn't be cold. in fact, knowing me, i would be hot. okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. i wish i had pants on, instead of shorts, then i wouldn't be cold. i wish i had turned the thermostat down before i started this stream of consciousness. i was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so i am glad i am taking this class. there is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. he makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and i don't know anything about skateboarding. i also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. he does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. i mean, when does this fucker sleep? oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. if i lived upstairs i wouldn't stomp around like that. it is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. i wish i could go shopping instead of doing the homework i am going to have to do. that would be nice. i don't know if i am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. that sucks really bad. i want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. yeah, and go to academy. i hope college gets easier as i get used to it more. i hope it happens soon.

"as i gaze at the screen i sit and wonder what is the meaning of friendship. this is my main thought at the moment. i've had rough relationships with friends. to me friends are the kindness that everyone needs. they are around when nothing seems right. they continually partake in your days' events. friends give comfort that no other can give. no matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. therefore a friend is always ready to lend a """"helping hand"""". i guess friendship is a bond between two souls. a friendship is a promise to be """"there"""" whenever possible and an understanding of one's feelings. a friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. in a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. the greater is the heart. for a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend. a friend has no materialistic need and can only be repaid with the same truth that is given to you. friendship is a privilege and a great responsibility. as i write about friendship i think of my friends. one friend comes to mind. she is such a wonderful person. i love her because she accepts me for the way i am. for half my life i've learned to be scared but with her i know that it's okay to open up. so many things run through my mind that i don't even understand them. thoughts of hate and confusion run about my mind all the time. it sometimes seems as if time just passes by and i can't stop to take a breath. people around me seem to talk but nothing is seen or heard from me. sometimes i feel like all i do is live in other people's shadows. i feel that i wake up and i am really nobody.

"okay, i'm not quite sure what to write. i'm sitting in the undergraduate library right now because i can't get my computer at home to get internet access. it is a pain to have to have to come all the way down here to use the computer, but on the other hand it's good because while i'm here i'm going to study some other class materials. maybe coming to the library will motivate me to keep up with my studies. it's ten minutes until 9pm on sunday and i can't wait to go to bed! i just got done working out and i am already a little sore. i had a good day today, i did a little shopping this afternoon, and then i got to see my parents. they were driving through austin on their way home, san antonio, from fort worth. we went to dinner and got to visit for a little while. i was happy to see them, but a little sad because the reason they went to fort worth was to see my grandmother, my mom's mom. she has breast cancer and isn't doing as well as we'd like. she's especially nervous today because she starts radiation all over again tomorrow. it's kind of tough to think about this because my mind starts to wander and start asking thousands of """"what if"""" questions. what if she passes away? what is my grandfather going to do? how will my family survive? luckily enough, my family is very close, so i know that everyone will find the support they need, but there is still no way to prepare yourself for these things. my mom says that she's more worried about how my two sisters and i are going to be when my grandfather on my dad's side passes. he's only 69 years old, but he has diabetes and doesn't take care of himself like he should. my body is weak right now, mainly from working out, but i can't help but notice that i feel like my body is """"sunken"""" since i started talking about death. you'd think that i would talk about something cheerful, especially since i am a pretty cheerful person. i guess i just need to talk about my fears for a while. well, the rest of my life is going well. i transferred here from texas tech and i am adjusting to ut and austin pretty well. i definitely miss my friends from tech, but i can always visit them. i'm in an incredible relationship with my best friend. mark and i have been together for close to two years now. it's an amazing thing to find true love. it's kind of scary to think that this is probably going to be the guy i spend the rest of my life with, but without a doubt i cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with him. i feel like just yesterday i was starting high school, and here i am in my second year of college. god has given me some incredible attributes. i think i look up to my parents a great deal. they have been married for over twentyfive years and are going strong. it's an amazing thing to grow up in such a loving and supportive household. i think the most amazing part, is that the love and support does not end with my immediate family, it travels throughout my entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins. if you can't tell already, family is definitely number one in my book, and it will continue to be that way. well, i have rambled on and on for the past twenty minutes so it is time to go study and read.

"i did it oncer in the 11th grade and my stream of concious isn't as intersting as everyone elses conciouses it seems. i like breakfast at hardin house except for the fact that it closes down at 9 am the whole purpose of getting 10 oclock and 11oclock classes is so you can sleep until 9:30'10:30, but that doesn't happen when you have to wake up early. i hear sdomeone coming down the hall, i wonder who it is. i think way faster than i can type. i wonder who is going to be reading this. probably some psychology grad student who can tell that i have hrrible typing skills, the problem is that i reallt can't type withpout looking at the keyboard so i have problems with it. my sweetmate is ian the shower, she doesn't vbathe very much so that's is a refreshing thing. 5 minutes down. 15 more to go, i wonder what i'll think about in the next 15 minutews, well 14 now. i need to call marlie back. that stupid psychology survey is always busy. i can't wait for my telesis to start woirking; i'm tired of using my roomates computer. i think she is tired of it to. have you ever noticed that even when someone types """"she is"""" the reader usually reads it as """"she's"""". i guess cause that's the way we talk. i like to write in journals and i guess that's stream of concius but i'venever been timed. matt fowler is a really smart guy. i still remember his stream of concious paper in the 11th grade. it was about chocolate mousse. hmmm. my roomates cousin is really goodlooking. i'm looking at his picture by her computer tright now. i think i'm trying to hard to come up with some thing cool to write down becasue nothing is runnign through my head right now, weell at least not slow enough to catch. i cannot believe i just let my vouicemail pickup my phone. damn, i am a devoted psychology student! okay maybe i put that in there so matt would give me a couple brownie poingts. then again is this you reading this matt? is anyone readingthis or is this one of those do it for your own good projects? i think this could possibly be the longest 20 minutes ogf my life, i really want to check my voice mail. i'm going to be pissed if the caller didn't leave a me3ssage. i wonder what's for breakfast tomorrow. i have a lot of reading to do before my classes. the problem with college isd that everything can be put off until a later date. i've noticed that i'm hgaving a hard time not correcting some of my grammatical errors. can you imagine how hard this would be to read if i lewdft them all? i guess it's jusyt habit. rhendi has really blonde hair. i can't believe i'm putting my name on this writing it couold possibly ber used as incriminating evidence for what? i don't have a clue? i feel sorry for whoever has to read these? i wonder if matt fowler really wrote stream of concious or if he just wanted to sound cool so he planned it out? i don't like beer all freshmen guys are like trying to prove soething through beer i think. i don't know: just an observation. i like to sing i started my choir class today and i love it. so much better than highschool besides the fact that everyone in there is a haus my clothes are done strying. they're wrinkling because i still have 4 minutes lefgt to try and put my ming on a computer screen whoich is an impossible task. the words here represent about 5% of what has been runniong through my head. the number 5 and percentage sign are the sam ekey. wow. why are there so many houston people around? and everyopne from the nearby suburbs claims to be from houtson too. i am not even going to read this? why? i'll never see it again. the girl sitting next to me in class today doesn't believe in god. it surpriised me, i am the worlds most horribler typer. 20 minutes.

"i am going to take 20 minutes to do this psychology assignment. it's the end of the first week, and i already have tons of homework. i am getting a little homesick. it's ridiculous. i miss el paso, even though it is soooo boring. the phone is ringing, but i am not going to answer it. i need to go to a store and buy a calculator. if i keep busy, i won't get as homesick. i am watching tennis on tv at the same time that i am writing this. i have such compassion for monica seles with everything that she has been through. oops, miss-hit. i miss playing tennis at home. i am doing laundry, so i probably need to get the clothes out of the dryer, but i don't want to yet. bad call on the henman match. i am going to have to shower before i go to hillel tonight. i've got a real bad headache. i need to figure out how to send and receive mail on my new internet service. maybe i'll just unplug my phone, and use the existing aol just for mail. great shot!! i'll go through the internet for everything else, but since everyone already knows my aol screen name, i'll keep it for the mail. my parents would be paying for it anyway, since it's on their account. before i am done typing this, i need to get the unique number and professor's name and everything. i'll have to find it. this assignment is actually kind of fun. i'm really homesick, but i'll get over it sometime (hopefully). it's really hot in this room. grandma and grandpa are coming in, but i forgot when. i have so much that i need to do, that i forgot what it all is. my twenty minutes is up, i need to check my laundry.

" gregory benjamin's writhing assingment, september 11, 2001. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but i don't think it would be so bad. in the meantime, i still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. i do not want to read it! it is simply boring! blah, blah, blah, building, blah blah blah. i am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. i wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats thermal delight in architecture that is. it is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). boring!. on thursday, i have visual communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. the proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he does not. i honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. anyways, i am majoring in somehing i love to do, so i guess i can trudge though the school. some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at wal-mart, the consumer of business). speaking of stuff i love to do, i love music! i really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since i have been wanting to do architecture since i was like, four, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . . on a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the counter reset!!! nooooo! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 500? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 680, and i knew people there. speaking of people from high scool, one of them is in this class. say hello to jeff prudon everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well try to call him out) you get your own personl shout out jeff! from the proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is i love what i do and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . and again, i won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i can t spell worth crap&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products! (oh wait. we already are!) i am running win xp right now :) i do like it, it hasn't crashed yet. . knock on wood. it would crash while i am doing something for class though, with my terrible luck. (spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 4 minutes left! hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. i guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! it would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . whoops! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. i find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 20min are up, and i have to sleep myself!

"sometimes i think of what other people are thinking. i watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. they must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. i don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. i feel strange in the fact that i am putting my thoughts into words. though i am concentrating on writing, i am also able to let my mind wander while i write. the way i think and the way i process my thoughts has changed since i've been in college. leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which i desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that i have at home. my life in austin is good, but it is missing all those people that i made such a major part of my life. i wonder if those people will ever be there again. my family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. my friends and my boyfriend are the ones that i spent ever spare moment with. now that i am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. i always travel back in time, in my head, to the days i spent with them. every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times i had with them. maybe they are thinking the same way. i can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. my mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but i have yet to see what she is talking about. my mother is great. now i realize all the things she has done for me. she was always there for me, and even now that i am hundreds of miles away, she still there. i was distracted by the distant voices behind me. they seem to be discussing a project. some kind of stress has been put on this group. i am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. stress is one thing that i cannot deal with. when i stress i start to think a lot. when i think, i get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that i no longer can do the things i used to do in the past. some people beside me are also using the computer. their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that i am writing about them. if i were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. i can always feel someone looking at me. even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes i can see someone look. even when i don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. after this writing assignment is finished, i have to drive through austin's traffic to get home. that is the only thing i can't stand about going home. what should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. things like that frustrate me. the light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. i have a feeling that austin is going to be just like houston, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. it is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. after that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again.

"i think i'm trying to hard to write what i'm thinking which defeats the entire purpose of this paper, you aren't supposed to think about what you write, you're supposed to write what you think about. wow, i was impressed with that little quote there. i cannot live without you.

""""i cannot live without you!"""" latin drums can seriously rock! especially in that damn song that i have had stuck in my damn head all day. my face itches. i hate when things itch. that would be a feeling that i would rather not have. if i had a choice of course. only 2 minutes left! that sucks! i'm kind of getting into this whole writing thing! we should do this assignment every week! that would rock. oooooooowwwwwwwww! damnit! i was stretching and when my arms came back down i hit my already broken ass elbow on my chair. that sucked! oh man, that really depressed me. that hurt a whole bunch. ahhhh! 30 more seconds! lets see how many letters i can hit! kasdfkjhasdkfjhaksdjhfkljasdhfkljadshfkljadshfkljahdsfkljhasdklfjhaklsdjhklahciluhekjhsdfkljahdsfkljhasfdkljhicukljaeno;iawejoijackjnowedjoaur9238u4r928jofjieodfija9we8urfojkljsdcvliuadshfckjenrflkh9pc8usdcioajerfkjriofjup98ufoasdfjkjnckdsjcpoaiufpo0wuero9qu8w3roiqwjrefknsdovjoaisdujva98weuf9wuefroawkejrflkijsdfolaijsdfoiaujfoikw4ejfoijasdoifjasldkfjao;sdifuj0waoejflknvoijc0932i1-09i-1i-0 ha! that's how many letters i can type in 30 seconds. well, technically, it was less than that because i was finishing that last sentence up. well, my 20 seconds are up. good luck on trying to pull meaning from this madness.

"i am reading a book called atlas shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel i've ever read. ayn rand wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that i feel are very important to all humans. i find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. the anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a """"fair"""" chance. it really is disgusting. just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. this is stupid. if those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they? i also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. these are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. personally i would hate knowing that i found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. i would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where i was. but not many people think like this anymore. i guess that i just have way too much faith in my abilities, but i'm glad i do. ayn rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. so in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called john galt decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. he decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, atlas shrugged. so one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. it is such a great argument too. you should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. this is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. the men who build the world in this book form a secret utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. anyway, i have this friend called jason and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. actually he's not my friend anymore because i don't want such an asshole for a friend. he's the only person i've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. you hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as i am. he thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. the only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. i have heard say horrible things about all of his """"friends"""" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. i've overheard him saying that he's set in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 500000. this wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. of course, this is probably the root of his problem. i've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. if he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. he doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. and, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. he really has sever problems. i guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what i mean, the biggest asshole ever. anyway, uhmmmmmm, i went back home this weekend to get my car and i got to see my dog. i missed her more than i missed my parents. she's so pretty. she's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. she had her tail between her legs all night long. my roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. he's listens to a different kind of music than i do, but that's cool, because i'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 20 minutes are up so bye bye.

"geez, this long hair gets on my nerves sometimes. ok, it's 8:35 now. so if i just write till 9:00. this being on a web page reminds me that i need to get working on my boss's web pages soon. more like it makes me feel guilty that i haven't started yet. oops, better throw that away. boy my room is messy, wonder if my roommate cares. he said just so long it was on my side of the room, but . i'll clean later. though i need to do more homework. (8:37. boy, i'm really watching that clock). japanese is hard. i really should wear chapstick instead of just licking and chewing my lips. geeze, this room is messy. i'm glad my parents aren't here to see this, or they'd freak. they'll probably be irritated that the last e-mail i sent them was so short. i need to go get my course schedule planned out. i hope i can get my typing speed up, 75 wpm is fast, but i'd really like to improve my accuracy. i wonder if i should drop a class and get that job dan was talking about. maybe i'll drop psychology. nah. why is it that people don't accept pagans? ever wonder that, reading person? do they not realize that all of us are silly fools, and us no more than them? oh, well. that quote was cool: once dogma enters the mind, reason ceases to function entirely. damned if i can remember who it was by. william wright or something. man my memory sucks. i caught myself forgetting what i was talking about in the middle of my sentence several times today. it's a wonder i can remember forgetting. dam, what was i fixing to say? probably need to condition the hair tomorrow or it will be upset with me. and use my retainer or the orthodontist will hang me with it the next time i go in. it's cool that jodi finally got her braces off, she's been wanting them off for a long time. she looks much better without them. looks like stona noticed (devious snicker). i really hope this doesn't turn out to be too long. being able to type fast probably means that i'm going to get more down here than other's would. i wonder if they make some kind of odor-eater stuff for sandals. this things smell like the north end of a southbound horse. hey, look john's online. boy i'd hate to be the people reading these. but then, i guess they like reading people's random thoughts, since they are in the psych department. that hole in the stupid couch-bed here in my room reminds me of the one i cut in our couch at home playing with a razor blade. my parents will never let me live that down. woah! it looks like my roommate had been home (8:47)! i should be more observant, should have noticed the change sooner. home. my parents would be very pissy if they found out i was referring to this place as home soon. you know, having to write these thoughts down really interferes with getting them in the head and processed properly. i mean, i'll remember the ones i get, but i'm not getting as many as i would normally because i have to dedicate so much of my left brain to typing this stuff. i would really like to be programming but i have so much homework. 17 hours is just too much, but i don't think i'd dare take less unless i had a reason. boy i hope i can fond a job that pays well enough for me to stay down here over the summer and still be making enough to stand up the $9'hr i would be making in dallas. you know, i can probably spell check this for you. hold on. ok, well, that's kind of cheating, doing computer stuff while i'm supposed to be typing ,but i'll type a little longer to make up for it, eh? i was just checking to see if you were using a form mailer so i could have my emailer check the spelling for you. uh, oh, a message for me? ahhh! i don't understand this program! oh, well. oh! i see. ok. nevermind. you'll have to get used to me, i suppose. i don't ever actually ask people questions, i just ask them to stand still while i say a question at them and figure the answer out for myself. the only questions i ask these days are things i don't feel like looking up in the reference manuals myself. i really admire stona for making those """"what i believe in. """" memoirs. i really should make some of my own. but then there's the book i'm trying to write and stuff and that's just too much. ahh! so much to do. oh, well. just have to forgo literary stuff to have time for the other stuff. messy messy messy. damn, why do parts of your body in contact with other parts sweat like hell? it's not like they're going to get any cooler by it, and your body is wasting moisture, you'd think that that would have evolved out. but then, i don't suppose that animals rest in contact with themselves often. i wonder why casey didn't take my contact when i offered it to him. i finally have a book he shows an interest in reading, so that maybe i'll get to loan him books for a change, and he turns me down. i really wish he's come visit, he just keeps driving down to sa, like austin isn't even on the way there. and to see my girlfriend. i'll just give him a guilt trip and he'll come by. or at least, stay away from janice. great, that means that now janice will think that casey has time to go down and see her but i don't and casey lives even further away. super. she's going to be thinking that, i know. (8:57) this is long. but it is easier to do than i thought it would be. maybe i should do this more often. it's a lot easier than a journal, and seems to g o a little faster. go. i think i'll write a game of go. that sound easy and fun. yep. then i'll let dan and his happy functional programming self make the ai. nope, there are some things i will not write in here. thank you. i wonder how accurate pennebaker's lie - detector tests really are. i wonder if some yoga guy came in that has awesome control over his heart rate and blood pressure and sweating and stuff, if he'd be able to fool it. i wonder if i would. prolly not. i suck at controlling my breathing rate. which is really cool. hey, person reading this, i have a recommendation for you: meditate. cross self-hypnosis with the meditation method of your choice. it works great. trust me. ok, well, it's 9:00 now. i hope you help someone with what i've written here. thank you. bye.

" i wish travis would stop switching channels on the tv. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at ut. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. so in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. for a 19 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature? i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like kendra im gay and i'll be like i know its about time and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of pbs. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his alone time with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video ",0
" so i don't know exactly what im supposed to write about here. i guess whatever is on my mind at the moment. my roomate is watching some wierd movie right now and the lady in it is screaming about something going wrong. and her husband is talking on the phone to another woman. maybe he's cheating on her with this other woman. who knows? so it's 4:22 right now and i don't want to what else to write about. . i would really like to be listening to dashboard confessional right now. they are such an awesome band! i really am getting into them lately! chris has got such an amazing voice. . plus he's gorgeous! i went and saw dc last month. that was a great show! i want to see them agian. tehy need to come to austin soon. they would have a great turnout if they did! last night i went to a concert. . it was at the austin music hall. jimmy eat world, sparta, and cave-in all played. . jimmy was amazing! sparta was a lot better yesterday than the last time that i was them with dashboard and weezer! i actually kind of liked their music! and then cave-in was alrigth too. i had fun watching the drummer's ab and arm muscles move around and work as he played bis drums with his shirt off! it was nice! why is it that all drummers play with their shirts off? i guess they just like to be topless. and have all the girls stare at them. or maybe it's just a sweat thing as baxter says. who really knows? baxter is a cool girl. im glad that i met her at orientation. . i have soo much fun hanging out with her. . but chris is great! he is soo funny! and hes so sweet too! i hope he gets my email about wanting to be study buddies with him for french class. . . that would be a great help! plus you know i'd be able to see chris more often. . wahoo! he is soo adorable. but really. i do need the help in french. thats one of those classes that you really have to work hard at every single day in order to get good at and stay good at. . he seems to be doing pretty well in there. especially since he took french longer than i did. maybe a year more. but who really cares. he is better at it than i am. or so i think. i hope he wants a study buddy too for that class. because i really want to do better on my next test in there. i want to pul my grade up from a b to an a, which i won't be able to do unless i get help from someone else. and chris would be the perfect person to get that help from. anyway. im getting tired of typing everyhting that comes into my mind. . . but i guess thats exactly what everyones blogs are about. just them randomly typing waht they are thinking about and sharing it with everyone!!! john sur is good at that. he always has something interesting or intellectual or funny to say in there. . its great! i am soo glad that we became friends. he really does seem to make me feel smarter just because he teaches me so much! especially and my faith. . he really has influenced me and helped me out so much with that. . i don't know what i would have done without him. his everlasting questions and curiosity have made me wonder and become more curious myself about my own faith and i thank him for that. also for him and holly inviting me to the bible study back home! that really helped me out tremendously! i don't know what i would have done without that group of people. some of them have become my best friends this past year and i don't know how my life would be different without them!! they really do make me feel like a better person for knowing them. . and i thank them from the bottom of my heart for them always being there for me with all of the neverending support! i miss all of them soo much here at college. but at least i ahve a few of them here at ut. john and chris are here. and i'm glad about it! they really make me feel more at home here even though i may not see them all the time. . they are such great friends!!!! oh and my fig! its amazing! im soo glad that i signed up for it. . it truly does help you feel more at home here in school and make ut feel like a smaller campus. because i really don't think that it seems like it is as big as everyone says it is. i mean. i see people i know everywhere. . . wheter they are in my fig. i went to high school with them. . middle school. orientation. camp texas. or i just know them from something else. i see poeple that i know everywhere and i'm glad of it it sooo nice to be able to that!

" i'm home. wanted to go to bed but remembered that i had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week. maybe this wouldn't take that long. i can handle this. something is making a noise in the restroom. did i turn on the fan? i got to write more. this is harder than i thought. i'm not thinking anything. was i always like this when i didn't have anything to do? should i go to bed after finishing this assignment or should i stay awake. i think i had an appointment with someone. or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in. is there any assignments besides this. my roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now. wonder what he did with it. i'll ask him when he comes back. my eyes hurt. i should really do something about my glasses. when should i go fix it. ? feel tired. i should really go to bed. only 9 minutes passed. half way done. wonder if i can just stop here. maybe not. hm. let's see. what am i thinking? wow my feet are covered with dirt. amazing i didn't notice that until now. how did i get this on my legs? i want to wash it off but i'll wait until this assignment is over. 8 minutes to go. what are my parents doing anyway? hope they're doing fine. when would they be able to receive the email i sent few minutes ago. anyways, i feel like i really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was. guess i'll figure it out after taking a nap. am i still not there. never knew how long a 20 minute could be. thirsty. no water around. now i'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make. time is almost up.

"my name is keely and i am a freshman here at ut. moving away from home has been a difficult task. i have really been lonely here. i have noticed that it is getting easier though. i do have two brothers that live here in austin. my oldiest brother also attends ut. he is in his second year of law. my other brother josh doesn't go to school, but hopefully he will decide to one day. classes have also been getting more difficult. i have been really stressed out because of all the reading. i am really nervous about some of the upcoming tests. hopefully i will have prepared myself for them. i have a boyfriend named jacoby. it was really hard to leave back at home. i miss him very much. this coming weekend is our year anniversary. i really want to go home to see him, but i don't think i'm going to be able to. it is very difficult to be here in austin without all of my friends. when i'm bored there really isn't anyone to hang out with. my brothers are working a lot so they don't have much time to hang out. my parents were sad to see me leave for college, my mother expecially. i am the baby of the family. my mother is extremely emotional. she often cries and gets depressed now that all of us are gone. she also calls us a lot more and e-mails me all the time. i feel sorry for her! the only person she hangs out with is my dad. my dad isn't too bad, he just is set in his ways. he sits in his recliner and watches nascar all the time. my poor mother has to sit there and watch it with him. that really doesn't sound too fun to me. anyway, i know that i will eventually get used to it here, but it will take some time. i just try to keep myself busy so that i don't have time to think about how homesick i am. at least i have my brothers here. i couldn't imagine being here all alone. i would drive myself crazy! my roomate is really cool. i got really lucky with that. we have soo much in common. she has the same since of humor as i do. also, we have all the same classes together, which is really helpful. now it doesn't seem like i'm alone all the time. i have her there going through the same thing. another thing is that the bus stop by my dorm takes me straight to my brother's aptartment. this makes it very convinient. i can get off campus and try to get away from it all. well, i seemed to have come to a block. i can't think of anything to say. i'm trying to keep typing though. oh, i really am enjoying psy. class. it is really interesting! i know it is only going to get better too. psychology is my major (at least for now) so this is my type of thing.

" oh man i'm so hungry. i can't wait for the football game tonight, it's going to be lots of fun. wow, i think really fast, cause i'm so thinking about 3 things at once. hunger, football, and the giant pre-screening survey thing that i just took. can you believe that i finished it at 2:54, only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them. man talking about some pressure. speaking of pressure, i just thought of physics, which is kind of weird since i don't have physics this year. i do have math though. i played cards last time i was in class. we played this crazy russian game. it was really cool. we tied in the end. ^_^ wow, ok, so now that i typed ^_^, i thought of anime and forums since i use that on forums all the time, and it's an anime face. and now i'm thinking about how i can type without looking at the keyboard. i just moved the mouse, and that reminded me of a real mouse. man, i make a lot of typos. of well, did you know that i learned to type too early that i lifted my hands off the keyboard so i could type faster since, i had small hands. and so in i think 10th grade i had to fix myself, and retaught myself 10 finger typing. cause you see this """"hover hands"""" typing caused me to look at the keyboard. the song just changed and it totaly distracted me. speaking on song, i met a girl named helen song, the first day of psycology and she's really cool. i like her a lot as a friend but at the same time i want to ask her out. but you know that my biggest fear (and pretty much the only one) is losing a friend. and so i have trouble asking girls out cause i'm afraid after they say no, that they don't want to be friends anymore. why am i telling you this. oh well, for all i know you don't read these, or you read them completely. hehe, you know why do some people type hehe, and other haha. you told us to think about our reactions and our observations. i bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking, pay more attention to their random observation thoughts. i bet that produces a lot of weird data. me, well i ask a lot of questions, and think really fast. i often find myself daydreaming. all the time! hehe. so yeah, wow, hehe sounds like a girl to me. not to self, refrain from saying hehe. i glanced at the clock for the first time. i wonder is that means that i'm finally bored after 8:30 minutes. but as i keep typing, huh, i thinking more about the actual act of typing. i just looked at the title, """"stream of consciousness of writing"""" but now the music changed to a good song so i'm distracted from that last thought. this song is good. it's techno. i know that i listed to it cause it matches my lifestyle, fastpassed? wow, i can't spell. so yeah, my sat score was 580 reading and 780 math. that's just a little weighed don't you think ^_^. there it is again. i just though of the entire universe and big guns, and planets and spaceships, this is going by way faster than i can type, but trust me that i'm having a ball here. soccer, now that i haven't played in a while, and i just started playing tennis. that was tiring, but i want to work to be the best. starcraft, and my daydream story just came into my mind. you see in order to pass the time i come up with a story and slowly play it out in my head with extreme detail. a single day dream could take up to month to complete, as i start and stop it when neccissary. man, i'm getting excited about football. you know i've never seen a whole football game before. i'm sweating, maybe i should go turn down the ac, neh, that's my mom's domain, and well i don't want to stop typing. what only 6 minutes left, well i suppose that means 75% of the time has passed. i wonder why i converted this into a percentage. that's really weird you know. talk, that's what my phone said, cause it didn't ring, huh, strange, why would i type that. i think that means i'm focussing too much on typing and not enough on other events, although i suppose it really doesn't matter does it. but as i progress i think more and more about my typing. so do you know javascript, did you create that timer, or did you 'steal' the code for it, and use it on you site. i hadn't noticed this song was annoying till now. i normally listen to music when on my computer, you know like browsing the web, or photoshoping (digital image creation). the only times i don't have it on is when i watch anime, or play a game. speaking of anime, i just finished watching wow ok like 5 titles flashed through my head. hellsing, that was the last one i watched. you know i like anime much better than tv cause they can create a long drawn out plot which is infinitly better than a single 30 minute plot. it's like watching a book rather than reading one. reading, the last thing i read was a starcraft book, yeah it came from the game. that's sad i know, but i just couldn't focus on lord of the rings you know. i wonder how much other people type, i mean, am i a fast typer. the amount they turn in has to be due to the typing speed and not the thought speed let me tell you, cause we think incredibly fast.

" ok. . i;m sitting in this computer lab of this co-op i'm supposed to like and really bond with. unfornuately, i don't like the people very much,it smells, and the kitchen always wreeks of too much garlic (like a disgusting amount. ) oh well. but i really like this keyboard. i think typing on a good keyboard is very important. it can really effect your typing and writing experience. it also has this great squishy thing for my wrists to sit on. all i want to do is pinch it all day. but there are other things i have to do. :) ok. what next. well some say i'm very neurotic, but my boyfriend was supposed to call around noon and i've called 3 times already and he hasn't picked up the phone. it kind of worries me when he's that late at returning my phone calls. then i think about this really great hair iron i just got a week ago and how wonderful it is. it's so wierd that something could make your hair look so healthy when it is actually so damaging for your hair. get this. it get's so hot, that i've had serious burns on my hands from just barely touching it. they don't like to sell this iron to regular consumers (i guess i know why) but i got a special hook up. now here's where i get neurotic. i'm really scared that i didn't turn off the iron this morning before i left and i wanted to tell chad to check when he wakes up. but what if he hasn't woken up because the whole upstairs is on fire and he's lying there unconscious or even dead????? see what i mean? i'm a huge worrier. sometimes i feel that i could strech my brain so far that i could litterly make myself crazy with worry. well, my feeling is. what if it were actually true? you know, bad things have to happen to sombody. why does everyone think they won't happen to them???? well, technically, if i were to leave the iron on, it would probably just deconstruct itself and melt the plastic tub underneath it. but it could get hot enough to start a fire, i guess. you never know. well now i'm getting hungry and i'm trying to decide how to spend my time before going to psychology at 3:30. i have to put a note on this girl's door so she can help me find a replacement so i can get out of the god-awful place and then i have to check my labor assignments and then i have to check the phone book for the nearest cell phone provider so i can get a phone charger replacement. whew!!! quite a day. oh, and i have to cancel an appointment with my dad because i just want to spend a few hours with my boyfriend. it that so wrong!!!!???? i saw my dad for 3 hours yesterday and he still wants more time the following day!!! sometimes people just drive my crazy.

"i can't believe i'm doing this assignment should be asleep right now i wish that my roommate would quit playing his music. my other roommate is a dork he's always talking about god and crap and telling me that i shouldn't drink and this and that fuck him he's no better than me he's just as bad in other ways i really hate it when all his friends come over here it's like fucking chinatown that's what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the 22nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and that's where all the hot girls are i need to get on that floor i should have just lived in towers that would have been better. speaking of hot girls i wonder what stephanie is doing right now. i really should call her and try and hook up with her i can't tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but it's hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did i just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that i am just a perverted moron but that's not true i don't know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think i am stupid, especially when i am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and i can't believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable. i wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game i really hate my pledge brother nayel that guy seems so shady if he's not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch he's acting like a fucking tool that should be nayel's new nickname, tool. oh well its been 20 minutes and i am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye.

"i don't understand how the man with the questions can be the smarter of the two. the man with the answers has to be the smarter. all the man with the questions know's that he know's what he doesn't know and wants to. but the man with the answers know's. whatever he want to know he knows because that's how the question goes. there's no way for the man with the questions to more than the man with all the answers. one, the answer guy's going to know the answer. and people are always going well does he know how to get the answer?? well of course he does. just ask him how he got that answer. and he'll answer that question. what i don't understand is how this teacher is going to believe and only think that she's right. the answer was completely easy to comprehend. i hate that teachers get so arrogant. just because they know more of the subject they think they're knowledge is invincible against all others. how can you teach others and let them learn if you're unwelling to learn yourself?? it's totally bull. makes no sense to me. always dreamed about being a super hero. guess it's somewhat ironic that my vietnamese name translates to mean hero. i don't know i guess i have some type of super-hero complex. always want to help others always want special powers. always wanted to win the girl. always a dream about this girl. never see a face and can never hear her talk. i can see her figure and i can see how graceful she is. she walks be side me in my dreams. always want to hold her hand but afriad that i'll wake up when i touch her. so i walk beside her and look at her. i know i'm going to meet this person. i can sense it. real into the """"crow"""" look the romantic dark super-hero adventure story. brings out the use of love. people always take love for granted and if not love the good fortune that they get to be with or have a relationship with others. wonder if i'm a hopeless romantic. i can see myself taking my date on a walk or just laying there with her and talking. i don't see the sex, not that i wouldn't, or much else. the tai kwon do club at this university is not very well trained. the main instructor may be a good fighter but his form sucks. to me form is the most important part of martial arts. adds gracefulness and at the experienced level makes movements faster stronger and completely balanced. it all comes from form. the traingle is speed balance and strength and not of that comes from bad form. or at least none of those three will continously exel without balance. most people don't see it that way. they think that compromising form for quick speed and strength is better. but they don't look in the long run. just like in chess the game is all about the long run. and with mastering balance, speed and strength will always become faster and stronger. then there are those that are lazy and don't even care for form and try to show off their katas with feet not lined up and hands out of place. with such bad alignment energy will not flow correctly . people get so arrogant and greedy. makes me sick ",1
"i'm sorry, but i just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. where does that come from? what, is it inherited, or something? do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell? i just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings? i can't wait until it's my birthday. i can finally watch titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. leo. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure leo. ahhhh, pure heaven. i wonder how people like him handle their lives. i mean, i don't know what i would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. my life would change so much; i'm not sure if i would like it very much. i hate the media. they make so much out of the stupidest things. why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money? it just boggles my mind. it's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many """"smiths"""" there are in the world. o. k. so, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. and, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. hell, even i do sometimes. all those sleazy magazines that say stuff like """"see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 20 arms and 5 eyes. """" crazy stuff like that. it's ridiculous. but, i must admit it is pretty humorous at times. i know when i'm in the grocery line, i browse over the titles just to get a laugh. i can't believe it's already 4:30. where did the day go? why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. it's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the """"time flies when you're having fun"""" does not necessarily pertain. well, i guess it could. i don't know. all i know is that even when i'm not doing much, the days go by faster. that kind of scares me in a way. i have so much i want to do with my life, and what if one day i wake up and realize i haven't done a thing. i mean, what if i went to the doctor today, and they told me i only had 3 weeks to live? then, what would i do. i wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that i've always dreamed of. i wouldn't meet the man i am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. that's awful when people find out something like that. i couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. i still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 3 months to live, and he lived 2 years before he died. but, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning? i remember the last time he went to the doctor's. he sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. first of all, how can any one approximate someone's life? but, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 6 months to a year. he just shook his head, and said """"no. that's not going to happen. """" he said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again. ",0
" i'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. i was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best i can do with how ready i am now. it's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, i've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. you'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. so much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. that which makes things most apparent is contrast. i could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if i drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then i'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which i don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. escher's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 2 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from geb, egb, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. with any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. the anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. but what is to name something? very far from actually understanding it. so we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. murphy and godel, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of murphy's law was true. i hope that makes sense to someone besides me. how can anyone ever trust words? they give us so little to go on. try describing an experience you had to someone else. they'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. the impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. i am the universe and i act in the universe. i can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. let's try some meditation. you hide, they seek. sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. this is as true now as it will be now. hahaha. oops. i don't know what it means. my ass hurts. i should shift or something. that's better. i think i forgot what i was supposed to be thinking about. don't take points off, please, haha. i still don't know what it means. any of it. i've done this type of thing before but the time i remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. the goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one i was handwriting and somehow, i still can't explain it, i just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd ",0
"as i sit here, i wonder what i got myself into. i came from a school of 300 people. i graduated with a senior class of 76. the university is such a huge place, i wonder if i'm going to fit in, or should i say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. it's not that i don't like my classes that i have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but i wonder what the future holds. my birthday is today, and i am finally 18. it seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. but now that i finally made it, it's no different. my mom called this morning to wish me a happy birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. her little baby girl is now 18. she asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. my grandparents also called this morning. they live across the street from my old house, and i was continuously over there visiting them. she told me that she still thinks that i'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. she says it's like i'm gone for the weekend, but i'll return soon. and my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. every time i look at him, i see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. raising 8 kids is no easy job. the day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. i was going to read for the mass. i went up to the podium and i looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. i was so proud to be a part of that. i was thankful that god allowed me to be there and have that feeling. and now when i talk to him on the phone, i get that feeling all over again. i miss him dearly. sometimes i think more than i miss my mom or my brother. now, my step dad, i don't miss him at all. sometimes i look back, and i don't know how i put up with him so long. he is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. he married my mom when i was 6 years old. i didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. he was just a total control freak. nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. from getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and i had gotten into a name calling fight. he's a dick, that's all there is to it. i never brought friends over to spend the night; i never wanted any guys to come over to see me. my escape place was at my grandparent's house. i would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. all he would tell me was that i could come up there and live with him any time i wanted to. on weekends i was hardly home, i was usually spending the night at holly's house, she is my best friend. now that i'm at college, i don't have to put up with him anymore. i don't plan on coming home anytime soon. my mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. talking about what comes to mind is difficult. i feel that i have burdened you with all of my family problems. don't feel sorry for me, i don't. life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes.

"he'll never live that down i'm glad i finally got to this website so i can get these essays over with, i still have to write the other one before friday--i can't wait till homecoming, natalie is such a sweet girl--i wonder what color her dress will be? who else will i know there? is it wrong that i'm going back home after just being there this weekend? i had so much fun with natalie but i'm very upset with brooks. i just have to forget about him and continue reminding myself that he's a jerk and natalie doesn't like him how could she ever like such a loser he can't get along with anybody and he brags all the time. if i ever get like that i hope someone tells me and i hope i listen to them. wow, this is really neat- it's like getting all my feelings out and it's really relieving some stress. can i swear, i'd better not, i don't want to get in trouble--this is college you don't get in trouble--tomorrow is my birthday! actually my birthday is in less than an hour--18 years old means i can buy cigarettes, dirty magazines, get into clubs, get into bars--of course, i would never do any of that stuff--only perverts get dirty magazines and i hate smoking--it would be cool to go to a club sometimes but most of the girls you meet there are pretty easy---i like natalie so much--i was going to be really upset if she didn't ask me to homecoming--even though i'm at college and surrounded by a bunch of really cute girls, i would rather be talking to natalie than any of them. this was the first time we actually spent multiple days in a row with each other. her mom is so old-fashioned--""""you saw david yesterday so you don't have to see him again for a long time"""" well we went to a football game saturday, chili's on sunday, and bowling on monday i bowled so well 156--that's like the highest i've gotten in 2 years--she's just good luck i guess i'm so lucky to have supportive, caring parents they have taught me that school comes first so it is not really that hard for me to be away from home and i don't have too much trouble getting myself to do homework. that stupid lab stuff is due tomorrow. no maybe it's due friday i wish i didn't have to take ch 204 it looks like it's going to be the class to give me the most homework i heard it was a weed-out course for chem e i don't really feel that much stress right now--i should be really scared about not making it as a chemical engineer because my dad, uncle, and sister are all chem e's but i know i can do it and i know the only way i won't make it is if i don't study i can't wait to be 18 i can finally get a credit card-- if i get a credit card will i spend more money? i doubt it i have check cards and they're the same thing i've got to stop eating out so often dad is paying for all my meals at doby and if i'm too lazy to walk over there it's my own fault ---lazy--am i gaining weight? the freshman 15--would natalie still like me if i were fat? i don't think i'll get fat--i can always diet i lost 20 pounds just 2 years ago boy i hope my parents buy a smaller house so they can get me a car i wonder if they'd ever get me a camaro probably not """"no 2 door cars you can't get groceries in them"""" how often will i be putting groceries in my car anyway? boy i type pretty fast i could be a court whatever it's called who types what everyone says--that would be such a scary job if you ever got behind how would you ever catch back up again? has it been 20 minute yet i think so ",0
"i guess i have no started my 20 minutes of writing for the psychology class. as i'm writing i keep on looking at the clock to see what time it is to see when i'm supposed to finish typing. i think about what i was thinking in class when you talked to us about this hw and how i wanted to talk about certain things while i was doing. but actually i start thinking about what happened tonight. we all hung out with the fraternity and just bonded by going to dinner and then going to just talk and catch up on everything we did over the summer and afterwards we played capture the flag. i wish my roommate would listen to better music. after capture the flag we all decided to go swimming instead of capture the flag because we had all gotten tired. we put it to the vote and that's what we ended up doing. afterwards our president asked us to make this a dry event. i support him 100% because one i don't drink, two i don't think that it is necessary to drink to have a good time, and three i think that all the points that he made were very strong. my roommates had a problem with it because we are all part of the executive board and we thought that before saying that he should have asked us all instead of doing it by himself. i think that they are wrong anyhow because as president i think that ted did the right thing in telling us not to drink and i don't think that there was a need for him to consult us. it was an executive decision. i'm debating whether i should go outside to the pool with everyone else when i'm done with that. i was supposed to get together with a friend of mine tonight but we have been playing phone tag so it's not going to happen but i will see her on monday so i'm still happy. this weekend i have lots of things to do. i'm running through my schedule for the weekend. tomorrow i have to meet for lunch with a friend and afterwards we are going to the lake to just hang out. i keep on thinking about what else i'm going to write and how interesting this paper really is. i have never really sat down and typed everything i'm thinking but at the same time many of my teachers have always told me that i type just like i think; this causes my grades in grammar to be much lower. my leg really hurt because me and one of my roommates were messing around and we both deadlegged each other. but after the pain that we have both caused we have promised each other that we will never do that again. we'll see if we actually will keep it but i think we will. i'm the only one in the apartment right now cause everyone else is outside. i think about everything else i could have done tonight but in all honesty the last thing i really wanted to do was to go out and actually do something. i am very happy with the way that the evening turned out even though i would still have liked to see my friend tonight. i kind of like this girl but i'm not sure. she's cute and everything but we haven't really gotten to know each other well enough to where i can say that i like her but i do think that she's kind of interested. i also think about my friend who is coming up from southwest next week to come see and how she's going to spend the night. we have been friends for a long time and we get along great. but the thing is that we both have really flirty personalities so i'm kind of wondering if anything is going to happen. i know that it can't be too much because i have a lot of selfcontrol but at the same time i don't want thing to get weird or to have a girlfriend right now. if anything happens it will just be maybe a little cuddling here and there or maybe a kiss. we will most likely end up sleeping in the same bed but we'll see. i have the full intention of not having sex. i never have and never will until the day i get married. i have thought about being a priest for a long time so i'm just waiting for god to give me my call and i will follow his will. i really hope that he hurries up though cause i don't have a lot of patience. i think that i have a lot of qualities but patience is not one of them. i can be patient for certain things but i just hate waiting for people to give me an answer. i know that god doesn't count in that but i try to hurry him up. one of my friends told me this summer that if you ever wanted to make god laugh all you had to do was to tell him your plans. i'm wondering whether this will mean anything to you guys. i guess that it all depends on whether you are christian or catholic or simply don't believe in god or have another religion. i realize that there are a lot of people here at ut that simply doesn't believe in god and i think that that is really sad because they are missing out on a great part of life. i keep on looking at the clock and seeing how much time is left. i wish that everyone would be able to believe in god and receive the eucharist everyday. it is the most amazing gift that god gave us. it's sad how some people just ignore god or sometimeseven laugh in his face. this was what i originally wanted to talk about when i was thinking about what i was going to write in this paper. i thought that it would be great thing to think about because there is so much that i can write on but then i realized that i couldn't do that because it would have been planned. so i decided to kind of clear my mind and just speak my mind. for the most part i think that it worked because as i think back of all the things that i have written for the past 20 minutes i have gone through various different topics. ranging from drinking, to girls, to god. i think this was a really cool experiment and that other people should do it because it is a great way to realize what is going on in your head but also to help you put what goes through your mind in words. i realize that the time is up and that i no longer need to be writing but i'm also going to stop because my hands are really hurting. i notice that i almost finished a complete page of writing.

"i want to listen to more music. i don't know what song to download next. but oh well. i love listening to music when i study. i wonder why? i like listening to rock and alternative. that is weird i guess. most people would listen to classical or other soothing music. but i like studying to louder, cooler music. i guess that makes me weird. i wonder how things are going at home. i want to go back this weekend, but i know that i can't. i have a lot of work i want to do, and i really want to finish my calculus before the due date. i should sign up for tutoring down at jester. so far the class has been ok though. i understand what the teacher is saying, and i am not having that much trouble with my homework. i hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend. but i know that he is going to be really busy with his internship. he has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work. i guess i may be asking to much of him. i don't want to pressure him to come, so maybe i won't mention it. i still wish he could come though. i wonder how molina is doing? she is like 5 months already. she is getting pretty big. i wonder if she knows that natalie is having twins. so many girls are pregnant back home, that is kinda sad. most of them are really smart, and they could have done so much with their lives. i'm cold. i wish i could turn of the air conditioner. well, at least it's better than it being hot. norma still hasn't figured out how to turn off her alarm yet. it keeps beeping every hour. it is getting on my nerves. i wonder if i take the batteries out if she would mind. i'm thirsty. i should get some water. but i don't want water, but that is all i have. i need to get a job. i don't know how i am going to pay for the spring semester. i can barely pay for the housing as it is. i need more money. i hope everything is going ok at the ranch. we need the place to do better, or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school. i don't want to quit, but if it comes down to one of us having to leave, then i would rather it be me. my brother is doing well, and my sister only has a year to go. i have only barely started, i can wait a bit longer to go to school. till then, i can help out at home, and work with my parents at our restaurant. my foot went to sleep. i should move so it can wake up. i have so much work to do today. i need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class. i wonder how my friends are doing in class. i want to see vanessa. she should have told me that she got married 2 weeks ago. she said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married. that is a stupid reason. how can someone forget that they had gotten married? i won't get mad though. i am happy for her. i wonder if manny will ever ask me to marry him. sure we have talked about it, and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together, but still. knowing him, he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because i could say no. it is just like when he wanted to ask me out. i knew he liked me and he knew i liked him, but he couldn't ask me. so i finally made him ask me. i said,? we are not going anywhere until you ask me. ? so he finally did. i hope him asking me to marry him won't be the same way. that is definitely not how i picture my future husband proposing. well my time is almost up, but i need to keep going. norma is back in the room. she can never get her days straight. she just left again. i guess she is going to the bathroom. wow, time is almost really up. time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking. i think that is really cool. oh well. my time is up now. but i am still thinking. i have pretty much said my life's story, that is really weird. i thought all i would put down was how my day had gone. you know, like a lot of crap just to fill up space. i should stop now because i have a lot more things to do. i think i will stop now.

"my room seems nice, i mean it's not like home or anything, but the privacy compensates. i wonder what mom and dad are doing. hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia juany but anyways, my roommate is making noise by the mirror. it's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and i turned it on. i simply left downstairs for 5 minutes and i come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel, just surfing the channels when i wanted to watch the my show. anyways now that that is out i can continue. yeah, my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator. i went back home last weekend. i bought a couple of books which i want to read, but seem to have no time to do it; i have a ton of class reading. well, biology seems like it's going to be easy, chem. a little work, nutrition just pay attention during class. c. c a lot of reading. my roommate always eats late at night and i'm trying to help her get better eating habits, but in my opinion, she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight. her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines. this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me, like i want to talk on the phone with them. i don't like talking on the phone. i should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless i'm doing absolutely nothing; i don't like to get distracted especially if i'm watching tv, or doing some kind of school work. she (roommate) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are . 75 cents yeah, i haven't done any laundry since i got here but i can still manage with what i have in my closet. i really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers. well, it would help if i got all my book first. i'm missing one coincidently it's psy, i went yesterday and they have no more. hopefully by tomorrow they do i need to go over there after class. thank goodness i only have one class tomorrow. i have to finish my ch and c. c homework, shower, check mail, write my tuition check. red robin, i worked there an entire year last year, too much work for not enough money. my roommate was my superior there, but i worked as well as she did ,and many of times better (simply because the team liked me better) it's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her. don't get me wrong my roommate is a great girl; i've known her since 5th grade. i like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what's on her mind. yeah, they're calling her up to ask her to work this weekend, i'm not working there until the break. yeah, this time around i'm registering for my classes early, so i don't have closed classes like this semester but i have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester, having to move a lot of things around well time is almost up so later ",0
"hi i'm ben. i've been looking forward to this assignment since i heard of it. how often do i get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. i apologize. i can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. i'm listening to emenem right now. i don't want to give the reader the impression that i'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and i can type fast to it. man i pity whoever has to read this. let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. i was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no i wasn't high). i mean think about it. i'd go into this more but i'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. i really like ut. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. i like austin. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in austin. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. i can't stand him. i brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that i'm using right now. i usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. i suppose i could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but i promised my roommates this would only take 20 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 9 minutes really flew by. i'm a japanese major. now if you were wondering """" wow i wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? """" you know. i feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am i thinking about now. i guess i'm thinking about the way i think, and i guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. i usually think in words. unless i'm inebriated then i think in pictures. i don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that i have a short attention span but i somehow pictured this differently. i thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now i've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. while i'm telling you what to do, you should vote for gore. aww here's something i can write about: politics. i hate and fear george bush. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of austin is quite the insult. his christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. i rue the day the christian right gain presidential power. i also am happy i worked """"rue"""" into that last sentence. aww yeah. well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. i also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. i'm glad i didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. i will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. i promise you i'm not crazy. well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man.

"this is by far one of the most interesting assignments i have ever had to do not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time i have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. i am very hungry right now and i could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. i am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, i guess they need this many to accommodate 40. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. i am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons ut has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. i am actually thinking of being a psy major. i think i may double major with a ba in music and another liberal arts degree . i sure am glad i switched out of my performance major. i just didn't want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path i was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 20 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because i bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. i wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. i don't want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least i know what to expect. i am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. i think the radio show went well last night i hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we don't look so incompetent. i don't think i spelled that right. just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten. probably why they don't hire people right out of fourth grade. my roommate's hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple. i told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity. that word is soooo overused and really annoying. sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card. we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing. this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 20 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this, i apologize for the sloppy spelling, bad grammar and weak syntax. i guess that's what being a ta is all about, huh?

"well, i'm not really sure what types of things i'm supposed to be saying. i miss my boyfriend so much. i hope he has a safe trip home. i hope he doesn't fall asleep. i feel really sleepy myself. i hope i can stay awake for this twenty minutes. time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. especially when school work is involved. i wish i was a better typer. it is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. people probably think i'm not a very interesting person. i try to be, but i think i was born to be boring. be boring and study my life away. i really don't mean to be so studious. i mean i want to do well in school, but i think i'm too caught up in it. everything makes me nervous. it is so strange because even though i know this isn't going to be """"graded"""", i feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. i miss my family and my friends. i don't think i appreciated them enough when i was home. it is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. it took years to be so close to them, and now i have to start all over. i'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. i wonder if they miss me as much as i miss them. i'm so paranoid. i'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. what if they don't mean """"love"""" in the same way that i do? i hate being hurt. i like to be in control and be omniscient. i like to have the upper hand with people. unfortunately, i think most of the time i'm the vulnerable one. is that normal? probably. if i tell myself that enough i might believe it. could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. so many songs make that claim. it must be a truly amazing love. i am still in awe when i think about what jesus did for me and everyone else. he died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. what love! how sad though to think that not everyone accepts it! i feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. i feel like there is something i could say to solve it, but i just don't know what. i know i'm not doing everything i could for christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. i know i can't be perfect, but i try so hard to be. it feels that i come up short a lot in my life. it is so stressful. i'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. i can't stop though. kale is so wonderful. he would do anything for me. i can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. my parents have to, but he doesn't. it is amazing.

"well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, i finally found one. unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. i can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!) i am smiling now. i always find irony amusing. they are still pounding next door. what the hell are they doing. he heheeheh-they just called us the 'fort worth girls' now that's funny stuff. i seriously have a major stomach ache. it hurts soo soo soo bad. i have been sick for like, three or four days now, i really feel terrible. my insides just hurt and every time i stand up i get dizzy. this computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. oh well i only have 13 minutes left if i did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, i probably did not do. i kind of feel bad that these people i don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. that's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it? everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. i wish my computer was working. it's really, really cute. it's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. i wonder how i did on my french test two days ago. i hope that i did okay. i am seeing all kinds of new people. isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you don't know and will never meet? i think that that is , well to say the least, strange. my back really hurts. i think , wow, coughing fit, that i will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. i feel so bad now, physically and mentally. i cant wait to go home this weekend. have my mom take care of me and see my guy that i am kind of dating. i miss him. he says he misses me. i wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. i said that i loved him but i don't know if i really meant it. i don't know if i could ever really love anyone. after all, i really don't even think that i love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. anyway, he has a boxer dog named romeo. very cute. i hate most dogs however. i love my cats. i miss my cats. i am glad i am getting at least this first assignment done. i cant spell for shit tonight. i also manage to talk like a sailor. oh well. i feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until i leave, i guess i wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. i wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when i leave. that must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, i guess i'll just be as nice as i can be. i really don't want her to hate me but oh well. oh hello boy in very very short shorts. that is so montreal. i am just in extreme pain. i want to work out and i haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. hello freshman 15, 25, 55. i'm all about gaining weight this year. my mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. maybe i just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. i want to go to france. i wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. i really must be very very thankful. i am such a terrible person. i really really am mean.

"i just set my alarm on the cell phone because i didn't want to over write or something. i'm listening to fiona apple's song. it's called across the universe, i think. i don't know if i was supposed to put quotations around the title of the song. yes, i'm sure that's what i was supposed to do. this writing assignment is kind of weird cause i don't know what i'm supposed to be writing about and sometimes this freedom makes me kind of weird on the subject. too much freedom isn't always comfortable, i guess. i can't stop thinking about how bad i feel that i didn't go to my philosophy class on tuesday. it's not because the professor sucks. or at least i don't think it is cause i know he does kind of not get the point across. he's too vague. too much vagueness and too much freedom. both are not good especially if you want structure. i need structure in my life. i do because sometimes i think that i know what i'm doing and what i want to do but it just doesn't work out that way and i think it's because i just want things to be scheduled or i can't get them done. i don't' know how to structure my life, though. this song makes me so depressed even though i like it a lot. i don't know what to write about. i don't know if i'm supposed to continuously type, without stopping, or if i can stop to think about what i want to write about but not get away from the computer. i feel like my writing isn't quality writing here, but i guess that's the point of writing this. i've been writing for four minutes. i know. i stopped to look at the clock. i want to talk to my boyfriend. we got into a fight today because he was upset that i didn't call him and went over to a friend's dorm room. i know that's not what he's upset about though. i know it's because this friend of mine is a guy. i hate that he's so jealous like that. i mean, i don't mind if he wants to show me that he cares, but getting upset with me and hanging up with me like that, i just don't like. especially embarrassing me in front of my friend. i've known my friend, jonathan, longer than i have been with my boyfriend. i don't' know. i guess my boyfriend is just paranoid. i love him a lot though. i just wish we had what we had in the beginning of our relationship: blind love and trust. i don't know. i guess that once you go out with someone for so long, things just fly away and you're left with what you always thought you weren't going to do and be and say and feel. i understand why some women cry about their husbands beating them but yet they don't leave. it's called love with a condition. she loves him because she's been with him for so long. i'm thinking that maybe if i didn't type so fast, i wouldn't end up with too much for this writing assignment. first of all, i think this is the coolest writing assignment. not only because we have this freedom, which i think can get a little demanding. i think it's neat because we can write what we think. it isn't an essay on the revolution of blah blah. it's what i feel and think and want to say, which is always nice, especially in writing. i'm used to doing this though i guess cause i write in my journal often. i never type though, so i guess i'm getting more said. and believe it or not, i always worry about space on my journal. like, i worry that i'll """"waste"""" too many spaces on only one entry. i think i'm so weird. i guess i do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much. i am like that in many ways i guess. but i'm also guessing it's a better trait to have than not. i don't know. my computer is making funny noises. i hate my computer cause i paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it doesn't even shut down properly. plus, stupid dell won't help me any. i write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that don't even work. i've already tried a million times. it makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk. i miss home. i wish i could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight. i'm gaining so much weight. i lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that i looked anorexic. now that i'm in austin, i've already gained those ten back and i'm scared that now i'll turn into too big of a girl, that ill be that girl, the bigger one than all the other girls. i was only maybe 110 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 90, i looked bigger. maybe that's why they never wanted to go out with me. i don't know. maybe it's cause i'm korean, i don't look like most of the people where i'm from. the rio grande valley: either you're mexican or some type of mexican. even the general white population was considered a minority there. anyway but yeah i used to be cheerleader'student council president and all other kinds of stuff in junior high and i got to high school and cheerleading sucked because i was a freshman and everything else sucked. all my friends turned into druggies. about half of them went to rehab. i feel bad for them. but then again. i don't know. they're here at ut with me. well, most of them. does that mean i'm almost equivalent to a druggie? i've never done any drug besides drinking and smoking cigarettes and even that i don't do often. i wish i could find answers to some stupid questions that are so insignificant. whatever. all i know is that i want my future to bright and successful. i actually want to write. i want to sit and write my poems and my thoughts and write a book, but i know that won't ever be possible. i wouldn't' be able to do it as my job, my career. i know i need food to eat and money to pay bills with and writing books, especially when you're barely starting off, won't get you too much on the table and in your pockets. i don't know. i wish i had the patience to go through medical school but i don't think i could, and besides, i suck at sciences. i would never be able to go through all those damn chemistry and biology classes. i would die. i really would. why would i want to shoot so high for a career that will only bog me down with way too many hours? actually, the guy i was talking about before, jonathan, he has an uncle who is a doctor and he's so rich and makes his own hours, basically. he's working in the er right now because he likes to travel, and er doctors can usually go work at whatever hospital. i'm so tired. my shoulders hurt. my boyfriend is coming tomorrow to see me. i'm so excited. we've been going out for two years. it's like we're both from the valley and it's like i'm going to be able to see a part of the old me, at home. i haven't seen him for two weeks, which is nothing compared to the long separation periods when i was a senior in high school and he was a freshman up at a&m. yup, he's an aggie. funny how i got to be a longhorn. i don't even have all that pride in being one. i didn't even look into buying a sports packet to go watch the game. i wish i was back to being my peppy self like i was in junior high. did i kill myself? or did i let other people kill me? did i let other people tell me i wasn't good enough? i don't know. i want it to be 9:24 so i can stop writing. my shoulders hurt and my neck hurts. i feel too pressured doing this. but yet, i like this writing assignment.

"right now i have a serious feeling of relief. it is the night after my first day of college, and it feels nice to be home. my legs are tired. i miss my dog and my boyfriend. i wonder what he is doing right now. i hope i am doing this right. i guess there is no right or wrong when it comes to my thought process. i guess it just happens the way it wants to. i hope that i can get back into the whole school """"flow"""" again. i hope that i can get into it enough that i can get into the business school. i can feel you laughing at me already. everyone seems to think that i can't do it. i know i can. i will. my mind is blank. i am so worn out. i haven't walked so much in one day than i did this afternoon. i hope i am not sore tomorrow. i need to find out where i need to go in the morning. what time do i have to wake up? my class is at nine thirty. great! why hasn't my boyfriend called me? he was supposed to an hour ago. wonderful! oh, i have to call my mom. i wrote a check today that i have to tell her about. how much was that thing? that reminds me. i have to set up telesys tomorrow. just one more thing to add stress to my day. i should work on my typing. what is that noise? i need to take a shower. maybe i will wait until morning. i should call all my friends back home to give them my new house number. i wonder how college life is going for them. ut started late this year. thank god! i don't feel rested, still. what time is it? five minutes to go. i feel like my mind is blank. whenever i try to """"hear"""" what i am thinking, the only thing i end up thinking about is trying to think. that made absolutely no sense. i'm hungry. i really need to be more open. i've gone all day without meeting anyone new. i need to work on that. oh, time's up.

"i believe sometimes i think to much about what's at hand. i always have to be scheduled and know what's to come. i wonder if its just good discipline or if its a problem. for example its the first day of class and i'm doing the writing assignments already, it was my mind so i did it. my mind is wandering, i'm thinking about my girlfriend at home and what she is doing and thinking about, hopefully me of course. what are my other friends doing that went to others schools, do they feel pressured. what am i suppose to be thinking or typing about. i wonder if your looking for any certain topic we should be thinking about. am i going to do well in this class, will i get an a, b , c, d, or even fail? i guess i will find out eventually.

"well hello, it is not that late but it feels that way, i wonder what is awaiting me in the jester mail room. a package, a big one at that from my mother.

"i have gone to three computer labs this morning, and have gotten screwed out of all of them. it started over at the ugl, where i signed up for a mac, but saw a free scanner, when i sat down and logged in at the scanner, i realized my other assignment had come up. i decided to logout of the scanner because you're not supposed to use a scanner computer if you're not going to scan anything. so i went over to my assignment, but it was someone else's computer! so i decided to sign up again (disgruntled). this time, though, the line was about a mile long (not really, but still really long). about half way through the line, and a few minutes later, i realize that i had been assigned to a different computer, but my time was almost up. so i ran over to the computer and quickly typed in my password, but it wouldn't take it. i desperately attempted to logon before my time was up, but the insolent computer would not give it up! now a little less than happy, and a little more than frustrated, i went back to the line. only this time it was at least twice as long. no! i remembered though, my miss professor talking about a business lab, so i went over to the cba. of course it was on the 5th floor, and one of the escalator's was broken, but i made it up there; just to find out i had to sign up and wait a day so they knew i was a business student. how asinine! so i signed up (trying to dig my pen into the page) and proceeded to the good old welch laboratory, where there is always room to work. there were plenty of computers when i arrived, so i sat down (a little relieved) and pulled up netscape. the soul purpose of my computer escapades was to check my email and to do this darned project, so i tried to get into my account. """"this file does not exist?"""". what? """"this file does not exist?"""" damn it. of course, the computer couldn't do email. so i switched. same song, second verse. i tried three others, and still the same chorus: """"this file does not exist?"""". so i accepted the fact that somebody doesn't want me on email. i'm now trying to drudge through this assignment without breaking anything. and yes, time flies when you're having fun, but it moves as slow as hell when you're pissed off, wet, and hungry. that's about the only thing i have to look forward to now: eating. luckily i packed myself a lunch today. last time i neglected that responsibility and was forced to eat at wendy's. $5, and i felt like cap for the rest of the day. i'm trying to stay healthy. you see, last semester, i worked out really hard, and got pretty buff before the end of school, but throughout the summer, i lost access to the gyms, and i lost a lot of my muscle mass. now i am struggling to get back in the swing of things, and fast food really sets me back! you can add that to the list of anxieties, too. working out for the first week is always hell, but now i'm on creatine, and i am twice as sore. of course, now my hands are hurting from typing straight for 20 minutes, but that is bearable. i guess i sound like quite the whiner, but i am really an easy going guy. i always try to have a pleasant disposition; i really do, i walk around making a constant effort to keep a smile on my face ( it also makes it easier to wink at the girls). but today, things just aren't going well. i really wanted to check that email because i'm supposed to be getting a message from this gorgeous girl. but oh well, maybe my lack of correspondence will serve as """"playing hard to get"""". well, 20 minutes is up, and my hands need a rest! hope this is what you all wanted!

"i have read for classes almost all day. i can't concentrate on anything that i start to do. i will read a couple of pages, and then i will take a break, or i will do something else. i don't want to get behind, but i just am not motivated at all. i want to have all my reading done for my classes before i go to them. everyone tells me that it will help me to understand the lectures. i don't want to be catching up all week. i want to try to get my reading assignments for next week done before i go home for labor day. i am excited about going home on thursday. i don't want to have to read anything while i am there. i have not seen my friends for almost three weeks, and i will finally get to see them, not just talk to them on the phone. i don't really talk that long to people in the phone. i have only talked to my best friend three times in the two weeks that i have been here. i feel like i have been in austin forever. i came to school early for rush. sometimes i wish i would not have gone through rush. i did not get into my first choice sorority, but i got into one with really nice girls. i don't know whether this is something that i want to do anymore. i don't even know if i can get out of it. i just can't wait to go home where life is normal. i just want things to be like they have been all of my life. in the past two weeks, my whole life was turned upside down. i don't feel like i have to stay here. i feel like in the next few weeks this will all be over and i will go back home where i have always been. i do enjoy my classes. right now, they do not seem to hard, but i am sure they will get much harder. i only know one person (at the most) in my classes. i feel like i do not have any friends. i meet all kinds of different people, but i would not consider them my friends. even some of my high school friends are not my friends any more. my best friend all through high school is the only person that i still talk to. i dated my other best friend during high school, and we were finally becoming friends again after breaking up, and then it was time to leave. now, i find out that he was lying to me about almost everything. i don't understand why he could not tell me the truth. it is not like i care who he dates, but it would be nice to hear it from him, and not from other people. i don't know about other people. all this makes me question all the people who i thought were my friends. i just feel like everything is spinning out of control, and i can't do anything to stop it. i would really like to feel settled here. i want to feel like this is my home. i know that it will take time. i just wish time would elapse quickly. i think things will get a lot better once i get into sorority and school a little more.

"as i walk down the middle of campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, i feel like a star in the huge night sky. with so many stars scattered throughout the sky, i seem to go unnoticed and lost. this is a feeling that i have seldom felt. as an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen i have always been one of the brightest stars. just a month ago, i seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. i now feel lonely and intimidated as i embark on this new phase in my life. i feel like i no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. knowing that if i do not obtain a b in chemistry 313, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? as i search for answers, i question whether or not i made the right decision to choose to attend the university of texas, or if i'm even college material at all. what am i saying? going to college was never an option for me. i want a good life for my family and i, and i've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. my parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. however, i could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support i have received from my family. throughout my life, i would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. though i regard them so highly, i also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. the transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that i have left behind were not so great. it is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because i accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. i feel that this is somewhat peculiar because i realize that even if i was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. eventually i would be left behind. as i work to achieve and to be the best i can be, i hope that along the way i will find the happy, positive person that i once was and know i still am.

"right now i am sitting by the phone debating on whether or not i should call this guy who is both my friend and currently the guy i have a crush on. he lives in katy so i miss him a lot. i also have this nervous'excited feeling. i can feel my heart race. i tried calling earlier and talked to his dad - i think. i don't know what to do! my roommate just walked in and smells nice because she just took a shower - reminding me that i still have to shower sometime tonight. i keep thinking about all the things i still have to do tonight - like shower, read for journalism, read for art history, back my bag, someday soon wash some clothes, and maybe clean up a little. just random things but i don't have much time because my roommate goes to bed early and i'm such the night person. getting up is a pain in the ass though. those 8am classes are hard. i'm so tempted to skip but i never will because school is important to me and especially my parents! what a mess of papers on my bed! too much to do and too lazy to do it. i just thought about my email. i love email. i check it all the time and am so disappointed when there is nothing new. i had a crazy email crisis this morning. i hit the wrong key and sent all my mail and a folder to the trash can. what a scare! i recovered it though but was almost late to art class. now i can't help but think what to write next. i am still thinking about the phone as time goes by because i have to call - if i am going to call - before 10 pm. i guess i won't call tonight because it will probably just stress me out or bother me. i am done with class by 12:30 tomorrow so i will call late in the day. i miss him and worry about him and so desperately want to see him. he makes me feel so comfortable and always makes me laugh. i can't open up with many people as easily as i can with him. i miss him and wish i could might more people like him. i just don't know where i stand with him and i wish i did. i worry now that time to stop approaches if i said enough because i type rather slow but i did put honesty and effort into this. it is weird opening up for this assignment.

" i always pride myself on my ability to be creative but lately i feel restricted. i am spending more time absorbing everything around me than actually reflecting. i also feel lonelier than usual. i know this is normal, so i don't feel strange for the feelings. i am used to being surrounded by chaos and people i know. all of a sudden, i'm in a school more than twice as big as my town and a dorm more than twice as big as my high school. i am deep down enjoying the experience. on the surface, i am just caught up in reorganizing everything. i am also still recovering from last year. i keep thinking that things will pick up and that i will meet people. i don't know if it is just a slower process than i expect or if i have high expectaions. all i know is that i love austin as much as i miss new mexico. i miss the scenery and the openess but now i get to enjoy a more vibrant and colorful scene. more than anything, i am excited to be around new music. i am listening to grateful dead right now- as i have for the last year. right now, i feel that my scene suits the music more. i also am excited to be around live music. it has a better taste. i think i miss good new mexican food (burritos) almost as much as i miss my old room. i miss being able to walk down the street without running into another person if i feel like it. i miss my friends. i miss being able to have inside jokes and laugh without even talking. i think i have more potential for good friends because austin appeals to a particular crowd including myself. in nm, i made friends with the peop[le that were available. in austin i will make friend with people that i hve common interests with. that is why it takes more time. i am not used to the freedom that i have recently obtained. i want to experiment with the limits of my freedom, but i just haven't found good opportunies. i haven't done much since i've been here. i can't tell if i'm lazy, timid, or just in the process of figuring out my niche. education is more interesting when it is by willpower. i like learning when i have the choice to go to class. i also get the idea the teachers in college enjoy teaching more. that may be a generalization. i'm a bit scared aobut tests. i don't know how to study yet. i actually was scared yesterday, but not today. i bought a to-do list yesterday and wrote down everything that i need to do. even though i haven't checked off much, i feel so much more organized knowing that it's written down. i actually fell more compelled to check stuff off (that's why i'm writing this now). i hope i don't fall victim to my lack of self dicipline and poor study habits. i truly enjoy being disorganized and careless. i think it gives me more personality and a more colorful life. a reckless and wild life has its o elegant motion. more than anything, i think having careless adcventures (i. e. hitchiking home from a party) makes me more creative. all i want to do in life is to write. well, i want to do more, but that's my main ambition and source of happiness. i think adventures inspire what i write just as much as education builds a foundation. all of my college experience will be relevant. i get excited writing about what i want, but i then look back at the time i've been here and feel a bit unaccomplished. my wrist keeps popping when i type, and it really hurts. i have to slow down. i should probably start working out again if typeing at my computer is strenuous. my roommate is cleaning our room right now. she is a bit cumpolsive, but i'm glad that it inspires me to stay organized. well, i'm organized on the surface. my closet and drawers are a different story. i love how i decorated my room. i think interior design is next on the list to writing. i wish i could study it, but i don't think i could make it into the school of architecture ",0
"this is weird and different. i'm not exactly sure what i should be writing. i really love it when guys can play the guitar. i don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness. i hope, oh i forgot what i was going to say. that happens a lot. twenty minutes seems like a long time. anyway, i'm listening to hotel california by the eagles and then i think i'm going to listen to my sublime cd. the beatles were like musical geniuses. i bet them and frank sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women. i would have had sex with frank sinatra back in the day. i made a list of celebrities i would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but i'll share it because i really don't care. it's not like i'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was lindsay lohan, michael vartan, john mayer, and jake gyllenhaal. i bet john mayer is an excellent lover. no one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover. huh, i don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head. i'm so glad stephie is my roommate. we have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well. sex and the city is such an awesome show. i think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them. is it bad that sometimes i want to push my morals aside and do things i know are """"wrong"""". since i've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style. i hate that they judge me. why can't i just live my life the way i want to? being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things i've ever done but now that i'm doing things that the church wouldn't approve of i'm noticing that i'm pushing everything i used to stand for aside so that i can """"experiment"""" with different things. i don't regret anything i do, but sometimes i don't think i make the best decisions. i'm happy though and i guess that's all that matters. i'm sure god is an understanding god. i'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life. sounds like a lose lose situation to me. i really need to lose some weight man. i was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210. so now she weighs. 137. wow. i need to lose that much weight. i wonder how she did it. i should have asked her. some days i'll feel really self confident and pretty and i'm like well i guess i love myself the way i am so someone will love me for me as well. then other days i'm like """"fuck, who's going to love a fat slob"""". i hope i meet the one in college. i hope he's amazing in every way. is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? that would be sweet. first things first though. i need to shed the pounds asap. yes. after this i have to study italian. that's going to suck. i probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away. oh well. this week was a lot more productive then last. so this weekend i plan to really catch up and get my shit together. i really need to pull my gpa up. i want to do good. i'm going to do good. i just wish i weren't so damn lazy. bah. i wish i were going to college station tomorrow. i want to see my old friends but i don't know why if they're just going to look at me like i'm the devil. my leg is still twitching. that probably isn't a good thing. i'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend. i wish i could find someone who enjoys my company as much as i enjoy theirs. i miss chris so much. i wish every time i was with him could be like that night after the john mayer concert. he's so much fun to be around. i think i come off as bitchy and annoying but i'm not sure. i wish someone would tell me. i have the beatles song """"black bird"""" stuck in my head. i want to take guitar lessons i just wish they weren't so damn expensive. i'm so glad i only have one class tomorrow! yay! i kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better. otherwise looks like i will be going to college station. we'll see how that works out.

"ok. i've finally made it here! you know, i had always thought that once i got to college, the stressful life i once knew back in my home town of conroe would no longer exist. well, i was so terribly wrong! however, though i am completely busy every second of every day, it's been a blast! yesterday for example: i woke up bright and early at 6:30, had class from 910 and 1011, came back to my beautifully decorated dorm in jester west and tried for like an hour to get to this page which i later found out was down at the time, then, briskly ran to my philosophy class which lasted from 12, after which i tanned, went back home again to brush my teeth and wash my face before my psy. class (yours!) from 3305. once class was over, my friend johnna and i proceeded to take the long hike back to jester in the rain! (yay!) there, i ate my first meal of the day pot roast! mmmmm. next, i had to walk all the way over to my parking spot on trinity where because i needed to get some clothes my dad brought down for my some time last week that have just been sitting in the trunk of my car getting all wrinkled and nasty. rather than walk back with two armfulls of clothes, i decided to drive back. after the laundry was hanging safely in my tiny closet, i took it upon myself to fight the 630 austin traffic over to my grandparents house off of lamar where i was instructed all week by my mother to take my car so it could get a new inspection sticker. while in traffic, i happened to notice that my sticker would not be out of date until november! this was particularly angering to me because tonight from 912 or so, i was to attend a mixer with my pledge sisters and the pledge members of sigma ki and instead of having just a few moments to myself before i had to take another shower and proceed to get ready, i was cooling my heels in a traffic jam for a car inspection sticker that wasn't necessary at the time. however, once at the grandparents house, i did stock up on some much needed food and beverage products. now, i am finally back and i have all of 10 minutes to sit on my floor, watch a little tv and eat some reesesmini cup. after that, i quickly got ready for the nights planned activity. the party actually turned out to be pretty fun except for the fact the austin police made two appearances! luckily, neither me or any of my sisters had formal charges brought against them. ok enough of that. only about 6 minutes left and i still have so much to say! let's talk about the future i want to live in a loft apartment in new york city with huge, towering white walls, bay windows, and blackandwhite checkered tile in the kitchen. i hopefully will be an established poet. also, i would like to have a successful career as a professional buyer. now, this job would be just too great for me all day long, i would be able to shop! my clientele would range from movie stars to the rich who haven't the time, or fashion sense, to dress and style themselves. ah! my time here is up! thank you and i hope you have enjoyed the show:)and remember kids: carpe' diem!

"i'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind. this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote to the lighthouse and mrs. dalloway. her name will come to me in just a second. she was a very depressed person i still can't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die. oh well, i can't remember her name write now. it is strange that i can't remember her name considering i read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work. i think i can't remember because i feel too much stress the remember it. in fact, i feel like right when i stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head. i can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head. ok i am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what i read earlier today from c. s. lewis' mere christianity. it is amazing how much i am learning about the christian faith and i have been a christian for a while now. i like what lewis says about society and morality. how what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men. no matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion. well i think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id. i will vehemently oppose such a measure. it is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than i can write. so while i'm in the middle of writing this sentence i have already thought of 2 other things. i am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics. to get to such high positions of power, one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but i wonder if that is really true i wonder if there can be honest politicians i wonder if there can be honest lawyers. i surely hope so you know i remember reading one that diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day. i wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has i still can't believe she is dead you know i feel like i am kind of censoring what i write because of the possibility that so ta might what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it. i think i probably would if i were a ta it must be really difficult to be a ta and be a grad student. it is hard enough just being an undergrad student. my head kind of hurts right now i wonder if that is from stress i think it is. my apartment is quiet right now i am very glad i didn't go out with my roommates i like being by myself every once and a while. i love not having to worry about any body but myself but i also love being around people. i really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together i guess everything has its ups and downs even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on tuesday and thursday instead of on mwf i'm really now to nervous right now but i am sure i will get stressed out this semester i really need to learn how to deal with my stress. if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit. ok i only have to write for a couple more minutes. it is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about it seems like i think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever i have quite time to myself i wonder why that is i am excited about this psychology class. learning about human behavior is always interesting to me i think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- i guess sort of a power issue i hope that now why i am interested in psychology. well, my time is up now it has been kind of staged my writing but only slightly so i still have in the back of my mind this the knowledge that some one might read what i am writing oh well ",0
"rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now, i am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room. you see, my roommate carly is sleeping. she was fortunate to have no classes on friday. i on the other hand, have chemistry on friday mornings at 10. you understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away, often until long after i return. as is the case today, which is why i am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep. it's not that i need to sleep right now, it's the idea behind it--she sleeping while i am up and writing this paper. this paper by the way is the first of two papers i have been blessed to right today. this writing assignment is fun; it's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds. one word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time, very different direction. back to the second paper i'll be writing today. my ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday. we meet twice a week, one on tuesdays and once on thursdays. it is quite a walk to the nursing building. it is located at the far end of campus, so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus. but, i enjoy the class so the walk is manageable. ahh, all these pop ups keep coming while i am writing this. i really don't like the idea of pop ups. back to my paper. we discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class, all in preparation for the nursing field. it's hard to think of everything that we will one day face. that is, if we actually get accepted into the nursing program. it's pretty tough i believe. they don't accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program. i hope i get accepted. it seems to be the direction that god is pointing my towards. i don't now though; i think i need to have a couple more talks with him to see where he wants me and where i might serve him best. well, i'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity. so without further adew(i don't really know how to spell that word, but go with me on it) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology. i sure hope i accomplished the task at hand. it seemed easy enough. but i guess we'll see. my phone is ringing. i bet it is sterling.

"well, here i am in my computer lab in kinsolving. i just finished emailing my boyfriend. i really hate writing him sometimes because he never responds as much as i do. then again he is in houston and still in high school and probably doesn't have as much to say as i do. oh well that's life. god why the hell did i wait until the last minute to write this. i should have done this last week. well, then again i did. but the stupid computer didn't send it. so now i have to retype all that crap again. life sucks! well, it is not that bad, but to me it is. i really wanted to go home this weekend. my cousins re so stupid for not going. what the hell!! now i have to depend on someone else or i have go to their house this weekend. the last thing i want to do i spend a night there with that stupid sima. damn does that girl have a mouth or what. i can't believe that she made all that stuff up about mayur and me. i hope paras doesn't get mad about me emailing about that. god, he believes everything that i tell him. i know that he is wooped in a way. just because he doesn't drive around everywhere for me doesn't mean that he loves me any less. or just because i drive to his house a lot, doesn't mean that i control the relationship. well actually i know that it probably would not have lasted this 9 months if had not driven up there 28 times. do you know how many miles that is? take 28 times 60 miles each trip. that is a lot of mileage that i put on all the cars. i hope he appreciates everything i do for him. actually, i know that he does. he is the most perfect person in the world. he has never caused any grief in my life. if anything has gone wrong it is because of his stupid parents. why the hell won't they give him a break? i mean, what the hell is wrong with them? that boy deserves a car more than any other child. i hope to god that comes to ut next year. that would be the bomb!!! we would be like living together. but i hope we don't break up like all the other couples that come here and do. they have it made, don't they realize that!! i guess being around a person all the time can be a little too much. but that's the thing, i don't think that i could ever get tired of seeing paras. i haven't gotten tired after this long what would change my mind now. oh well, we'll see when the time comes. i hope we're still together then. i really don't know what would give either of us a reason to break up. i mean he adores the ground i walk on and i love him for that. just joking. i adore him just as much if not more. i mean, that's why my room is like a shrine to him. anyway, my time is almost up and i have to go get ready for neesh's b-day party thing. what the hell do i wear? i guess i'll decide in a minute.

"i'm thinking about if i am going to get the job that i want at the pac at the university it would suck if i didn't i am proud that the otc called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like i didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so i can't type as fast and i keep having to go back and erase but i like pressure i thrive under it but i don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words i do not like those because i am so used to using slang that i just do not type it anymore and i also hate having to capitalize my i's it makes me mad having to go back. right now i feel a little stress because i am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday i had a meeting and i did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all i could read was biology which is another class i don't understand i never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either i feel lost in that class it is so difficult i feel like i dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not i just keep thinking about what prof. pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. like screaming i guess but the professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home i had a divided keyboard the """"flowy"""" ones and now i have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment i like but i feel like i shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid i's and i forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the i messed me up again. well forget it no more caps; the i's are going to be in lower case. sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit i need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend i get to go home though i want to go to the game i have not boguht the sports package and i didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot i guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so i feel like i should go for him but i'm not going. now i get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe i'll get sick when i go home like prof. pennebaker said probably because i feel the migrane coming. i hate migranes i hate having to find a job hopefully i get a good one i have an interview on tuesday i hope it goes well and that i make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. i wonder how the bus works i keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause i have seen it once after running to the engineering building because i was late i saw the bus and i think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but i will take a look around and see if that's how it works. now i feel like i have run out of things to say i still have to do the experiment for this class i want to do the survey but since i am under 18 i have to get my moms signature and i feel like i should be happy about going home i mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like """"huh"""" and i hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is """"kidnapped' i know i worry too much but i don't want anything to happen even if it means that i have to do all the homework, i've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was i talking about i don't kno, i need to make friends me and my roommate get along but i need other friends and now i have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends i saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart asian in the elevator today i feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that i have are okay but i don't really relate to them why i don't kno i feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least i hope they don't and if they do i don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still i have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really i am surprised i wrote this much i thought i was going to run out of this to say but i like this assignment when prof. pennebaker said it i was like yes no grammar rules i don't particularly like grammar but i try i mean i suck at it in my papers i always score low on it 2 minutes and i have mentioned my time too many times i tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and i did nto so now i keep talking about not because i want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts i think it is the flourescent lighting i think that is how u spell that and i just put the letter u for the word you and i am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and i keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh i thought it was over but i am going to stop now because a i don't want to talk for too long and i have to go turn of this light and i am thinking about what i just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if i should put my name at the bottom but i won't because i have the code thing. well this was productive and i did not put well in caps.

"right now i am feeling much rage and it stems from the outcome of this weekend. i had traveled for three hours to visit my family and friends hoping that i would be welcomed with opened arms. half of my theory was right. my family welcomed me with much warmth but my friends pretty much took a dump on my face. well not all of them. a few in particular. my whole weekend was, in my mind a total waste of time. my so called best friends would rather spend time with their ridiculously uptight and stuck up girlfriends than to hang out with a best friend. i had known them my entire life and these girls just walked into the picture less than a couple of months ago. nothing but anger subdued my mind for the following three days. i refused to let myself be depressed so i figured i would go shoot some pool. but to my dismay, one of my friends showed up, this one was one of my female counterparts, and she pranced in with a guy standing next to her. so what. that part didn't piss me off as much as the fact that they were at a party and didn't bother to pick up the phone. not even to say hi. she did not even return my calls or answer my pages. to make it even worse, she pretended she did nothing wrong and pursued to make friendly conversation. to hell with that. i walked out of there without even saying good bye or giving a reason why. my mind was filled with so much raw emotion, the negative kind that can tear a hole through your soul. that's when i realized that houston was no longer my home. i no longer had any true friends in the city that i grew up in for 18 years. like i said, my friends had pretty much crapped in my mouth. i'm not sure if they were aware or not but that is completly beside the point. i am home now. the city of austin where i would rather meet and make new friends than to salvage the friendships that i already had. i believe it is a wise choice otherwise i will just continue to be put in such an unstable emotional state. not once this whole weekend i had a good thought in my mind. i was fine until my so called friends sold me out to be with a girl all night so that they could get freaky with each other. i've got no problem with my friends being horny and wanting to get it on with their girlfriends but at least hang out with me for one damn night out of three. now i can relax and look forward to this weekend where i will undoubtedly have a good time while my friends stay at home with their thumbs up each other's asses. screw all of them. i don't need them anymore than i need the toilet paper i wipe my ass with. austin is a hell of a lot more exciting than houston and my asshole friends can stay there because they were too damn stupid to get into ut in the first place. i hope they are having fun at community college, or high school for those that were too dumb to even graduate high school. good luck flipping those burgers at mcdonald's the rest of your lives.

"ok, i'm really stressed out right now! i've been running around all day, then i got back to my friend's dorm and remembered that i had to do this writing assignment! of course, stupid me. i didn't know the web address to get here. i had to call my roommate and have her look up the address on my computer. and now its almost 5pm! great. well, anyway, i'm so happy about last night. this really hot guy that i like invited me over last night to hang out at his apartment :) exciting! it was a lot of fun. now i can't stop thinking about him! i also can't stop thinking about ryan. he still won't talk to me because of that stupid bitch he is dating. i hate her. she got between me and ryan's relationship, firstly, and then our friendship as well. it's only been 4 minutes. i can't think right now. i'm so anxious for this weekend. well, back to ryan. every night for the past couple weeks, i've had dreams about him. they won't stop, it's getting annoying. even last night i had a dream that we ran into each other in houston and were immediately friends again. that's what i wish would happen. he looked so cute in the dream. so i wake up thinking about the stupid asshole. but, at least this morning i woke up next to a hot guy :) :) that makes things a lot easier on me. the only way i know how to get over a guy is by dating a new one. i need distractions, good distractions, to keep my mind off of ryan. it sucks. i miss him so much but i know he probably doesn't give a shit about me. so, i just want to feel. wanted. and if it's by this guy, jason, that would be perfect. he is awesome- cute, cool apartment, easy to get along with, funny, and he is even in the business school at ut! pretty impressive. of course, with my luck, i'm sure he has plenty of girls after him- so why would he choose to be with me. hmmm well i can pray that he does! at least he wanted to be with me last night, that's a plus. i have to think about something else! it's driving me crazy. i need to go hang out with laura soon. she will make me talk about something besides guys! yummm can't wait to order those delicious cookies from tiffany's treats! 13 minutes. alrighty then. i think i have about a million thoughts running through my head right now and i can't seem to distinguish any certain thought. does that make sense? ehh, oh well. school is a stressful place, especially now. what we do now creates what we can do for the rest of our lives! i don't want to fail. yet i'm actually scared that i might. i've never been scared of failing a class- ever. i never made below a b on my report card in high school. college is so incredibly different! i really do love it here. even though the classes are challenging, ut is awesome. i like having a big campus. it makes it feel like college. it's the way it should be. at least i have a little workout every day- walking to class and up & down all those stairs all the time. its tiring! ok, 2 minutes left. jc is distracting me. i want to stop typing now! i'm sure whatever i just wrote down is somewhat interesting. i don't even remember what i said. what should i do tonight. hmmm everyone is going to the game tomorrow. my dumbass didn't get the sports package so i can't go :( how sad.

" i'm really not sure what exactly i am suppossed to write about so i thought i would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's september 11th. that morning i woke up and things didn't seem any different. i put on my i love new york shirt and went to class. truthfully, i was very dissapointed with the people here at ut and how they acted that day. people in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. the tower played american songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. it was getting in the way of our discussion. whatever!! we should have been discussing september 11!! one girl in the class said, who cares!! people die every day!! we kill people in afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!! i personally was outraged by that comment. how disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. that night i went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. we stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. it was awesome. to be standing there next to my friends, people that i loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. to hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. and then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. the whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. it was very powerful. you couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in new york who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but wanting to go in anyways. i had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. and in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. at the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. i forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. in almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. you couldn't help it. then the whole crowd sang god bless america. hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing god bless america was absolutely amazing. i knelt down where i was and said a prayer to thank god for my family and my friends and for the fact that was so blessed. i picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that i love her. my family is the most important thing in the world to me and if i lost any of them i don't know how i could even go on. when it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. it made me think about the pictures i had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. a very powerful sight. the man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in pearl harbor on december 7th. that was an amazing thought to me also. it was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great american tragedy. however, this was a tragedy but not just that. in fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. i saw a commericial that gave me the chills. it was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking american city. the voice in the background said on september 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change america forever. the screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. the same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. in the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. the voice said they succeeded. i think that is a perfect way to say what september 11 has done for america. yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in america are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. at this point in my life, i am very proud to be an american.

"i am curious on why we need to do this assignment. is it some sort of test? or experiment? well i guess i have to do it any way, so. i'm think that it is late and that damn pretesting takes to much time to just answer the same questions reworded ten times each. i hope my show in san antonio goes well wednesday i hope those assheads advertised this time but if not we still get paid. but that's still bad business. i really like the common sense album i think i'll burn a copy from sterling. i wonder what my roommates are up to? probably just sleeping since they all have early class in the morning. my earliest class is spanish and i dread going to that class. man it takes up most of my schedule and if i don't do well it will bring my grade down big time, but crap like that happens. at least i can still be a frigging rockstar ha if all else fails. which isn't looking so bad or hard by today's standards. one hit song will get you paid for life and all i hit songs needs is radio play. no heart felt lyrics; no emotion, no good beat, and no moveable beat at all even just radio play. if you make it on trl your set damn we played with papa roach and there were probably 700 people at the show the next week they were on trl and now they could probably sell out a 10,000seat venue easy. i'm not putting them down they are a good band but that just goes to show you how the industry works. one of these days i'll be on top though no doubt. my band plays with a new band or a go to see a new band play ever week and half of them have no stage presence of any show what so ever. and if the crowd is not interested you can sell your total package to them. you can be a band that gets lots of radio play, but if you can get the crowd moving on tour your going to just sparkle and fade. my only fear is i'll be a 30yearold man with kids and still be hunting for this illusive dream and i really don't want to be in that boat. i assume i'll know when the ship has sailed and i'll just except it and move on not swim after it just to sink deeper. only time will tell though, if nothing else i had my days in the spot light but if my 15 minutes of fame are already up i'm going to be one upset greedy bastard trying to get my hand on just a little more. i guess i've talked about my dream of being a musician enough so i'll move on to my goals at school, which as you can tell are of lesser importance right now. not to say they are not important it just my dreams cloud my reality and sometimes it hard to see what i need to do rather what i want to do. so my time is up and i'll see you in class thursday.

"my goodness, i have so much stuff to do. where should i start? i have to call about volunteering and for sure email anne to see if they have a physical therapy program at her hospital. how will i get this stuff done. i am torn as to whether or not to join a fraternity. i think i will, i just hope i have time to get my studies done. as well as time to myself. i really need to get my bike back from maggie's apartment. i'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. sometime tomorrow i have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. i need 2 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. i am so glad i changed my class schedule. it will be so much better this way. i am so stressed out about physics. i so hope i at least make a """"b"""" in there. pray, oh pray. i should make it to the bsm thursday evening and check that out. i am sure there are some good looking ladies there. i can't believe the horns lost. what the heck? to n. c. state. they better come back and win this week against stanford. actually we need ricky back. another thing is i need to wash my car. it's pitiful! definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. i seriously hope things go well with the fraternity. i mean that is a lot of $$$. campus looks nice tonite. i love the tower. i think i like college football way better than pro. it has so much more of an aura to it. the pros don't have any spirit. the college game is where it's at. i wonder where my roomate is. that punk never tells me when he's leaving. i still have to do the pretest. i tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. i need to make sure and read for history and government. i hope this thursday schedule is going to work. i am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like i thought it was going to be. actually pretty good. oh man, i just got an instant message. oh well, i really need to finish this assignment. i kind of like this. let's me get my feelings out. i need to find a church for sure. i haven't been reading my bible like i should since i got to austin. i really need to work on that. i wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. this move from a juco college is a bit extreme. nothing like high school to college, but i went from a college with 5,000, to a college of 50,000. i probably have met 200 people so far. i am so terrible with names. i really need to work on that. my suite mates are being loud. makes me not want to study. or at least go elsewhere. i should probably check out the ugl or pcl anyway. i bet i could do a better job there in the first place. so what am i going to do this weekend? it being labor day, i kind of have a choice. i might go to houston to visit my sister or might stay and go to the lake with richie and jason. i really miss my folks. way more than i expected. i hope i get over it soon. i need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. i wonder what my new physics prof is going to be like? good or bad? nice or unpleasant? what? i need to start praying more. maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. whatever happens, i need to call gina tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. this class schedule is going to be so much easier! i love it! no friday school! three day weekends for a whole semester. i hope my tth classes aren't too strenuous all together. this is my first time to really balance 3 classes like that.

"ok, well here's the first writing assnment. to begin with, i'm really, really hungry. as is the case, in many college student's lives, i only woke up about an hour ago, and so havent' eaten anything. i've already done laundry though, so i guess you could say i'm semi=productive. i've also talked to road runner because they came out the other day and installed the new cable modem in my apartment, but it didn't work. so i tried all the diagnostics that they told me to do, and it still didn't work so i called them this morning. as is always the case, it worked when they asked me to go to the internet, so i seemed like a fool. well, as soon as we hung up the phone, i tried the internet again, and it didn't work. . i'm pissed. so now i have to use my roommate's computer and a regular internet connection, which is slower than anything else you can imagine. but on to other things. i'm going to play football with my co-workers from the club on 6th street (the vibe). it's amazing how you never know when or where a friend might come from. it has always been my belief that a boss will never be a friend, even though it may seem so at times. . . it's really just business. but these guys are different. perhaps it's the type of business, or maybe they are the one-in-a-million type, or maybe even i'm mistaken, but either way, we're going out to play football as soon as i finish writing this journalistic internet assignment. my best friend had his truck towed yesterday, and the day before he had his wallet stolen, so of course he came to me wanting to know if i'd lend him some money and take him to get his truck back. so, being the good friend that i am, i went to the bank and withdrew 150 dollars and took him to the towyard to get his truck. however, since he didn't have a liscense, i had to sign for the truck, wich only means that i could get into a world of trouble if he ever wanted to screw with me. apparently by me signing for the truck, my friend could come back the next day and ask for his truck, and since it wouldn't be there, it would be stolen which meant i would be held accountable for grand=theft=auto. but i assured my friend that even though he is bigger than i am, i have a lot more friends that are bigger than he is. . you never can tell with people. so back to being hungry again, now my stomach is growling, and i wish i would have eaten before doing this thing. of course, i am only half way finished, and i grow hungrier as each minute passes. i really shouldn't be playing football today though, because i should be reading all the assignments for my various classes, but what good would that do me?. . . really, i would be a unsocial. . . and besides, i like football better than studying. i guess that's wjhy my grades are the way they are, but who cares, i was a grade worrier all through high school. . i never got a b in my entire li8fe and graduated top 2% (14th of 720). big deal. i've realized now after 2 years of college that grades really don't mean that much. i mean, yes, you have to graduate and all, but how hard is it to make a 2. 5? i've failed a couple of classes now, and still have a 3. 2, so you obviously have to really screw up in order to make below a 2 gpa. i guess i shouldn't talk that way, because school is hard for some people, but then again, htat's just an excuse, because i think that anyone can learn somehting, you just have to find the right way to get to them. it's like physics. i can teach anyone physics, it's just a matter of how you explain things. back in highschool, my physics teacher was horrible at explaining things, and everyone was alwyas confused, but i would re-explain using every-day examples, and then they would understand. i explained circuit-theory using the large highways in houston (where i lived) as the circuits . the cars were the moving charges , on-ramps were like batteries, and so forth. using this method, all the people that i tutored on average scored at least a grade point higher. . give or take. anyway, i just wish i had it in me to be a teacher because i know i'd be a good one. i just can't see myself teaching. i want to own businesses, and yezs, make a lot of money. i have a business eye. everywhere i go, i'm always seeking a new way to make money, or what business i could start that would flourish. well, it's almost over, and i must say, i'm not as hungy \as i was at first. so thats it. there's my mind in a nutshell!

" ever since my boyfriend got this new job as a community assistant in an apartment complex, it doesn't seem like he has any time left over to spend with me. also, since he is a higher rank in rotc, he is even busier. so i question. what's going to happen to us? i ask him over and over again and he just gets upset. what am i supposed to think? every time this happens, we end up in an argument and threaten to break up which really hurts. i mean, he can't play with my emotions like that. it's not fair that he can have me waiting for him and giving up all my other plans in the hope that maybe this time, he'll come see me or make plans with never happens. it's not fair how he can just have me on the side when it's convenient to him. why is is that he seems like a totally different person now. not the same from the guy that i met more than a year ago. how can someone just change overnight? i am upset that when he does come and see me, it's is timed cause he says he's trying to squeeze me into his busy schedule. it make me feel like i am in prison and getting visitation rights or something. relationships shouldn't be like that. it was never like that in the begining. but he says he's a different person now. he just called right now and hung up on me because i told him i couldn't talk cause i was doing this thing for the psychology class. he's mad. but what am i supposed to do? after all, the reason i am here, is to go to school and learn and stuff. if he expects me to understand everything he does why can't he understand that i need to do this thing. i feel like i'm gaining a little bit of weight and that bothers me a lot. yet, i'm too stubborn to get into a diet and too lazy to go excercise at the gym. i am sooooo stresed out. not just from the crap i have to put up with my boyfriend but also because of school work and the crap i have to put up to with work. work does not seem fun anymore. it was in the begining when i first started working there for more than a year ago. maybe because it was my very first job and i was getting paid more that i thought i would be. or maybe it was cause i'm new in town and was meeting lots of people then who are my age. but now, it seems like work is just a drag. maybe i'm jealous cause my boyfriend has this wonderful job or may be it's cause a lot of the people and managers that i started working with left to another state or for another occupation and just wanted to get away. i need the money that is why i am still working there. i applied at the hospital a couple of weeks ago but they haven't called me back or anything. then last week, i decided i wanted to volunteer at the children's hospital and when i called to inquire about it to see what i got to do, they told me that they were good. they were good? how can that be. they're a hospital. i thought they always needed help. and i was going to do some services for free. it's not like i was going to ask pay or anything. it was going to be free. my boyfriend's roomate's mom works there and the roomate had told me that he was going to ask his mom to give me a job and he did and she said that all i needed was to give her the hours that i can work. i mean, i can do that but it would be really awkward in my position because the mom is my boyfriends ex mom. i just didn't want to be in that position you know? and i really need to start working in the nursing field and get out of being a cashier at heb because that's my major, nursing. that's another thing i was worried about. what if i don't get accepted to nursing school next semester? then what am i going to do? maybe i can switch to pharmacy just like what my friend did. but i don't think it will be any easier or anything. it was funny because one of my friends from my apartment complex is also a pharmacy major and was sucking up really bad to his pharmacy teacher so he ",1
"i just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason i can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. i love rugby. i was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now i can do that. i missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 7:30 pm instead of 7:30 am. i hate when i do things like that. i miss summer school at ut. it was so much more fun than the fall. everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. now i'm lucky if i see one of the people from summer just once a week. fall was suppose to be better. a girl that was my best friend in highschool, and i am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. all she cares about is her sorority. and when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was tired of dealing with it. why doesn't she quit? what is her obsession with being a part of something? i just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. instead we are moving further and further apart. every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. she always some how avoids it, and i don't know why. suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. i can't believe i just wrote that because i am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. she lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. we talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. she is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood i'm in. i guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. i never knew i thought about her as much as i do. i think i'll go and see ",1
"the funny thing is he doesn't seem very worried about it. i have a calculus test thursday and i'm really scared! it is my first test and its my hardest class. i have no idea what the hell is going on in there. this frustrates me because usually i'm very good at math. i'm hopefully going to get tutored before the test. walking around campus is very different to me . there is all these people swarming around everywhere ,each one extremely different from the next. it scares me because i feel as though i don't belong anywhere. in high school it was very easy to be noticed because the school only had about 5,000 people in it. i was involved in many different organizations had lots of friends, but i am the only one out of my group of friends to be here. it still seems very weird to me. i feel like i have all this pressure to succeed here from my parents. its like 'don't screw up' is constantly going through my head. my parents seem to be waiting for me to screw up in one way or another . well, got to go do more assignments. ------ ",1
" i wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean. what can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes. i'm not a very good typist for one. none too good at spelling either. i hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes. this computer screne is far too birght. i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this. i wish i could read some other students writtings. maybe i'd find some insight to how i'm doing in this rat race. maybe i'd figure out what the girls around here are looking for. how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it. i wish i were at the lake right now. no books, no tv, no phone, just a hamock and a cold drink. maybe a seadoo. a little bit of water sports never hurt anyone. accept the ones that crash. god i hope never see anything like that again. why did that have to happen, all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower. all they had to do was look around for boats. they could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldn't understand that a jet ski isn't a toy. a goddamn toy! how could anyone play with their life like that. i hope i go in my sleep. i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now. those poor bastards. i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though. i could never live with that kind of baggage. they didn't even know where their parents were. for the love of god, what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call. mrs smith, your daughters are dead. there was nothing we could do, i guess these things just happen. and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek. maybe i am ill. maybe i should get a bike. i could get around alot faster. maybe i should just leave early, then maybe i could loose some weight. mayeb i've got it all wrong though. maybe they don't even care about that. i should loose some weight anyway. its unhealthy. who ever reads this thinks i'm a nutcase. hello out there. welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind. its cold in here, but you'll get used to it. watch your step, there are some loose screws here and there. don't poke at that, i'm affraid it might fall apart. don't trip on that, its allready fallen apart. i know its messy in here but i'll get it all organized sooner or later. i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady. i hear they are very affordable. i guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole immigration mess. maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess, or our terrorism mess. or our youth mess. or our drug mess. who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are. i'll just let trusty george w. handle it. err, imean cheany ",0

but then other things i just know are right when lilly and are goof off and are being silly we have so much fun. but then how will they all think of me when they know the truth and is it really that big of a deal or is it because i make it a big deal. oh my gosh it has only been three and a half minutes. what is wrong w' me?

"i wonder if you are out there watching over me as i stumble through this maze called life. where on this heavenly universe do you have the time to make sure i don't get run over by the ut buses or nearly crash as i recklessly drive home from alli's house? you must be there because you are witness to my every sin and good deed. did you send a special angel to watch my every step and blunderous move? that's how i feel sometimes is that everything i do is wrong or misguided and i'm always worrying about whether or not i did the right thing. but i'm so glad i have alison and melissa to help get through this social forum called college. if i could go shopping right now i'd buy every single maryjane shoe in sight. oh to have money! but i feel so guilty to have these materialistic desires that christ does not approve of. he tells us to let go of these worldly possessions if we truly want to be a follower in his footsteps. i'm 18 for peaches sake and want stuff!!! as the father said at church during the homily, """"it's very hard to be a christian"""" am i one? i was baptized and received communion but did not go on to be confirmed into the catholic church or heck even do my first confession! that is way to weird for me. and what about finding the right man to fall in love with? what if he is so wonderful in every way but is skeptical in christian faith. like the guy in one of my classes i've never spoken to him but he seems sensitive and so good looking yet doesn't come across and """"christian"""" but appearances are always deceiving so i will hope for the best. oh my! i feel so guilty over something so insignificant but it bothers me. i did not say good bye to josh, only the sweetest boy in the world. he would have said bye. he even said hello to me and remembered my name. now i know why alli is having such a hard time getting over him and that he is perfect and has a girlfriend he really loves. that's so understandable. i wonder what it would be like to read all these confessions of the soul by psy 301 students. some people's brains i would be very scared of. i wonder what psychology boy wrote. quiet soul. like me. i like that. i wonder if my mom is doing good. i hope that i get to grow spiritually when i go t o church camp. yay! meet more people and make new friends. i find that hard to do i am always going out with allison. it's like she's the only person i hang out with. but we cling to familiarity and that's okay. i met erica today and talked, well, she talked. like her. good person. geo is nice boy i wonder if he still loves krista. i wish i had somebody's heart like that. god, when will i find him? i guess i m going to have to crawl out my shell if i want to meet the boy and leave earlier for class and sit right next to him. i'm really tired and i think twenty minutes have passed. alright, girlie. you are going to go to sleep and dream of sweet things and cute boys who open the door for you. thank you lord for allowing me to get these words out of my head into the cyber-psychology world.

"right now i'm sitting here at my brothers house. i'm very tired and wish i was in my bed. we had a tri-delt meeting tonight and i'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. it just seems like their is something everyday. i wish i could just do some stuff and not all of it. i hate other people having control over me and telling how i have to spend my afternoon. i just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. maybe i shouldn't have joined a sorority. oh well! i just need a break everything is happening so fast and i'm having second thoughts about the whole tri-delt thing because i really don't know anybody yet. maybe once i start to meet people i feel more comfortable. i'm very excited because my dad is coming to austin thurs-sunday. he is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. i haven't talked to my dad in awhile so i can't wait to see him. i guess i'm a little homesick or at least more than i let show. i just worry that i'm the only one feeling this way and i don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. but i don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. she is not interested in the same stuff i am and just sits around and plays on the computer. well enough about that. i'm really hungry but i don't want to eat anything because i worry about gaining the freshman 15. all my roommate eats is fat fat fat. so their is all kinds of junk food in my room and i get tempted to eat it. she isn't worried about her weight. i very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. she is real nice and i was surprised that she asked me to live with her. i said yes but i will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. last night was the weirdest thing i set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. this was the first time that i had the chance since i've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. i even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that i was with them. it was just two months ago. i wish i was back their right now because i had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. well it has been 20 min. so i guess i'll let you go. got to go study!!!!!

"i am pretty proud of myself today, for i got much more accomplished than i thought i would. i figured that after my last class i would just take a nap. but instead, i went to the gym and had a great workout. it's always good to make a plan of everything that you want to do in a day. i always have to do lists. they are so useful, and i feel so organized when i make them. and when i finish everything on one list, i feel so good. it is a great feeling. i haven't been having too many great feelings recently. i'm not sure if i like it here. i don't think i ever will either; that is what bothers me the most. everyone keeps telling me that it is going to get better, that i'll meet more and more people that i like. i just don't think it's going to happen. i really wish i had gone to brandeis, for things would be so much easier. it is a smaller school, near boston, much closer to my parents. then i'd be able to see brian and jessie so much more often. i probably could see them every weekend if i wanted to. my phone bill would definitely be a hell of a lot less. that would be so good, because i don't have enough money. i feel bad asking for more from my parents, but it would just be so much easier. i think i really want to apply for that job at george women. that is definitely a cool store because it has everything that i love there! another thing i have noticed about being a college student, is that now i don't care about how i look or dress or anything like that. in high school, it was such a big deal to wear the """"right"""" clothes and things like that. i didn't even mind doing that, and it seemed normal. i just miss my friends so much. i made such great connections with three people in high school, and i miss them so much. i am so jealous of all my friends who are so close to each other. why do i have to get stuck with going to this huge school? it's not fair that i have to go through so many changes all at the same time. i just wish things were easier. it would make me so much happier. i feel like i have done something awful, that i deserve to feel like crap. i know that if i just keep on going, day by day, then things have to get better. i'm just so used to having so many friends and knowing so many people. i have just gotten thrown into this huge pile of people, and not knowing any of them is just plain weird. i just hope that getting use to this school will be a lot easier and quicker than it seems like it will be. i think that things will become so much better once i get used to this school. i certainly hope so because i just want to be happy.

"today has been a good day so far. i only had one class today, philosophy, and it was better than the first time i went. i get scared here. there are so many people and i don't know where i stand yet. it is so much different from where i am from. my hometown is extremely small and everyone knows everyone so coming to austin was a huge change for me. everyone seems so smart and everyone seems to know exactly what they are doing, the classes they are taking and everything. i have know idea what i plan on majoring in. right now i am undeclared, natural science and i don't know where that will lead me. maybe i will figure it out one day though. i am sure i have too. it is so hot outside. my mom told me that it hasn't rained in my hometown in 51 days. i can't believe that. that is so outrageous. she also said that there were grass fires all around our house. that is so scary. i don't want anything to happen to them. we live so far out and all the fires have been our way. it is so scary. my dad works all the time. all he does is work. my parents are both coming down this weekend for the first ut football game. i am so excited. i think it will be a blast. i have gone to tons of games and they are always a blast. i don't understand this friend i have. she has always wanted to go to baylor, ever since she was a little girl. now, she has this boyfriend who goes to a&m and now she is going to transfer to a&m to be with him. and to top it off, they are getting engaged. she has been with this guy for only three months. i don't understand people sometimes. i mean you think you know someone so well and then one day you think you don't know them at all. there are only a few people from my high school here. i am glad though. i want to meet other people, to broaden my horizon. i didn't know my roommate before i moved here and we get along great. she is so nice and i think we will be pretty good friends. i have this one friend who did come here from my high school and she is negative about everything and everyone and it drives me crazy. she gripes about the sorority stuff and about people going out at night, about people laying out during the day, and just stuff that shouldn't even matter at all. i mean who cares about these people. let them do what they want and don't criticize them. it is so stupid the way she acts sometimes. she thinks that i am the only one she can hang out with here and i feel bad because i want to go meet more people and do what i want without being criticized for it. i wonder what my brother is doing these days. he lives in san marcos and i haven't even talked to him since i have been here. maybe i will call him today. he is 3 years older than i am. we get along really well, but he has a girlfriend that he is always with so that is another reason why i haven't seen him in a while. i am in this sorority. i don't know if it is me though. i mean i don't know if i want to tie myself down to all of that stuff. it is kind of hard to tell right now though. i will have to give it time i think. if i don't like it i will just drop out. i am so tired these days it seems like i have something to do all the time. like i never get a chance to just stop what i am doing to rest. i love austin though and i am really happy here. my boyfriend and i are doing pretty good too. i am glad about that. he lives in denton and goes to unt. it is really sad though that we can't be together now and we are so far apart. i don't know really what to do. i cry a lot about it because i love this guy so much and i want everything to work out, but i just don't know how we are going to be able to handle not seeing each other for weeks and weeks at a time. it is horrible. but, i think we can do it. we have been together for 2 years and about 2 months now so i think it is possible. i don't want anyone else either. i mean he is everything i ever wanted so i don't think i should even look for anyone else. he is the best. plus, guys scare me like all the stds these days i wouldn't know who was lying to me or who was telling the truth and so i think i will just stay with the guy i have now. oh, i miss him so much. i have two chinese pug dogs and i miss them too. college is such a big change. especially for me, coming to austin from such a small town. but, i can handle it.

"i don't really understand. i am supposed to track my thoughts and feelings? write about anything as long as it is for twenty minutes? ok. i kind of miss my old life at home, but i was so looking forward to moving on to other things. i have a friend that just went into the army last month and i will never see him again. other friends have gone off to college and moved away. life is starting to change a great deal. i work for a company called vector selling cutco, or at least i did this summer, and we had conventions every now and then. i would always make friends from around the country, but end up never seeing them again. people don't keep in touch with each other like they should. i try to stay in touch with my friends and people that i meet. it is often difficult, though. i don't know. i am really thirsty right now. i was thinking of going up to my room first to get a drink, but i didn't figure they would let you bring drinks in here, and i didn't want to wait to get this done. i have waited long enough. i need to stop putting things off. i need to get things done. i guess it is just lack of motivation. well that and lack of a computer. this is the first time i have been in the computer lab here at jester. i am really thirsty and my throat is dry. i need to get this e-mail thing worked out. i haven't tried to use it yet. i might do that when i am finished with this. i wish that things could be the way they were, but then i don't. you know how sometimes something happens and you just want to freeze that moment in time and never leave. that has happened to me recently. not since i have been at ut, but before, when i was with my friends. i like to spend time with my friends because they make me feel comfortable. i like to be around them because it is just very uplifting. my arm is starting to get tired because i don't have the right kind of writing area. it is uncomfortable in here. i need to go get a drink, but i still have a lot of time to keep writing, so i won't. i wish i had a computer so i could get things done on my own time. life would be a whole lot easier, i think. i think i should go home and see my dog before the neighbors try to steal him again. if i don't pay enough attention to him he goes to stay at the neighbors house. they decided one day that they liked him and they were just going to keep him. they tried to give me an ultimatum (i don't know how to spell that word). they said that if i didn't give them the dog, then they did not want him at their house anymore, but if i didn't want the dog they would take him. the whole situation didn't make any sense to me, but what do i know. i don't think that they had the right to ask for my dog. he is my dog. whatever. needless to say, i didn't give them the dog, but i got him fixed and had to tie him up for a while. he eventually learned that he had to stay at home, or at least near our house if he didn't want to be tied up. it rained yesterday for the first time in a long while. it didn't rain much, though. i missed most of the lightning the other night because i don't have a real window in my room. it is just like a quarter of a window and it gives me the feeling that i am in a dungeon. i hate my room. i wanted to get a plant, but then i realized that there wouldn't be enough light to keep it alive, so i axed that idea. i wish there would be a big storm because i like to watch the storms. the lightning, thunder, rain, and winds are really relaxing. my parents are building a house, but it is taking them forever. anyway, you can sit on the back porch of the house and watch the rain. it is very nice. my friends kate, abby, and alana are at southwest and i was just thinking about kate's yard and how nice it is. i bet it is really nice out there after it rains. the other night i watched a meteor shower and that was really beautiful. i like to look at the stars, but i dropped astronomy because everyone said that it was really hard and that all it was a lot of math like distances to stars. i didn't feel like taking a math class so now i am taking physical anthropology. i don't know. my twenty minutes is up now so i am going to quit writing and submit this because i am sure it is really boring anyway. i feel sorry for whoever has to read this. my wrist hurts. ha.

"college is perhaps the most unstructed, yet the most structured enviornment i have yet to face. vague, vague, it's all vague, yet so remarkably specific. i can't help but thing about what i'm going to say next. i'm engaged in an activity, that's how i work. when i'm doing something, i try to do it with the most focus i can. to simply do it with no thought is, to me, a waste of mind. back to college, i'm still trying to convince myself that i had no choice. had i given myself the option, i would be a music major, but i didn't do what i had to do. i slacked off on my music, a thing i can never forgive myself for. sure, in that time, i managed to develop my other skills in school, but what a becauset. i played viola for seven years to major in chemistry. sure, some may say that just having played is enough, but for me, to not bring about one's work to full potential is not worth anything. i hope i go through with chemistry, then at least i can say i stuck with something. listening to music right now, i think that perhaps i could have achieved that; maybe i still can, but it seems to far right now. at least the food is good, and my roommate is a nice person. i guess college will just be a test of how much i want to make a good life for myself. it's my brother; i'm so glad to talk to him; i had to leave him in the middle of the hardest part of his life (middle school); he was really used to having me there, but it seems like he's adapting fine. i hated my middle school years. the kids we mean and the teachers we less than happy to help out a shy little guy like i was. thankfully, high school was much better. college seems like it will be full of wonderful interaction, but i wonder how much interaction i'll be able to stand. i'm the kind of person who likes other people, but who also sees them as a distraction most of the time. and they always seem to distract when you don't want them to and disappear when you want company. i'll never figure people out. well, this has been a lot of uncohesive thought, but i guess that's the whole point. adieu and farwell ",0
" i am leaving to see my sister at the university of oklahomea and i will also see my high school friends this weekend. it feels strange going back to my home state. i feel like i have moved on in my life and in just these past four weeks i have matured into a completely different person. i feel that by going away to school i have learned lessons i would never have acquired by going to my state school. it smells like an old lady in my room because my roomate broke a parfume bottle three days ago and the smeel seems to have resided permanently in our carpet. the smell is so strong i can barely concentrate. people in my dorm slam their doors so loudly. it could scare a person in total relaxation. i am late to leave. my friend who is driving was suposed to be here about ten minutes ago. i guess this tardiness is a good thing becaus i need to write my paper. the problem with this paper is i can't type as fast as my brain can think. i hate instant messenger. you have it on and people automatically think you want to talk to them. and then after you fail to respond there is this constsnt message are you there. . are you there. well, i guess you don't want to talk to me. this isn't the case at all. it is just that i have too many things going on in my life to sit and have small talk, such as, oh how is school? i need to acquire better typing skills. that parfume smell is giving me a killing headache. i am glad i am leaving this weekend. hopefully the smell will begin to difuse into the air. our room is pretty clean for the first time since school has started. this is probably because my roomate is also gone so, she is not here to leave all her belongings strewn across the floor. twenty minutes is along time to write. at first you don't think it is a long time, but when you are actually up against clock it seem like eterninty. i have alot to do in the coming weeks. in two weeks, i have my first exams in all my classes. on top of having study, i don't know what the tests will be like nor do i know how to do alot of the material we are covering in chemistry. but i cannot worry about this now or else i will submitt myself into ultimate stress. yes, i am fligthing instead of fighting. i wonder if i will get to meet up with my parents this weekend. i thought at first when they left me at school that i would miss them uncontrollabley, but in relaity i didnt even cry. i don't know if this is becaus ei just havent allowed myself to cry for them or if i am just truely subconciously ready to mvoe on in my life. my back also hurts. i don't know why it hurts, but it does. i can't remember any activity i have participated in where my back would ahve been injured. maybe it hurts from running. i am having a mental block.

"right now, i am very busy. i am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group of people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. outside of my world at the university of texas, i am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. she attends the university of alabama, and she is also an incoming freshman. however, my troubles are very different than hers. yes, she joined a serority, but the greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. but what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. i, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. in my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. this process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. we often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. i am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. my feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. now, i have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. i worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. in addition, i am thinking of how alone i feel in this problem. my roomate does share a similar experience, and i can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. i don't want my feelings tp change towards christel, but i fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. digressing on a tangent, i can stare out my window as i type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of austin. coming from dallas, i have grown to appreciate austin's attractive landscape. it hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. my roomate is always creating some kind of noise. as i sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the sony playstation. does he not have homework to do? i don't know, i guess that it bothers me sometimes that i feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. will i ever feel completely happy again? in the near future? it's not that i'm depressed or willing to let go of christel to free myself of these """"troubles,"""" it's just that i want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just """"click together. """" too optimistic, i know. that'slife, i know, but i can still wish that things could be different. i never tyhought i'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. in a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. i guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. but, i've still got troubles. god, i sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that i am actually having a pretty good time. i have made friends, and i relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. i truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. damn, i've got to wake up early tomorrow. i wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life! my twenty minutes is almost up, and i really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.

"my first reaction to this assignment was to just write that i felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 20 minutes; however, i am interested in where this is going. right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how i can touch-type and he cannot. the other day, we went to go and buy fish. we drove around austin i don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. we drove to highlands mall, lakeline mall, petsmart, and petco. i finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. it really upset me that out of the 4 fish that i bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment i previously had. the sole fish that i possessed in that tank ate all of the food i would drop into the tank continuously. it really began to bother me when i saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. so, i took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. i understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. i knew that i was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. well, i finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so i eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. i am really suprised that i did this because i am such a humanitarian. for example, whenever my other fish would die, i would get other people to remove them from the tank because i couldn't deal with the dead fish. i always felt as though they were looking at me. there is one instance where i did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. i don't know, i think i have always had such a problem with death. it scares me, but it doesn't. for example, i used to work at a hospital in san antonio, when i was a junior in high school. this is where i had my first real encounter with death. i never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. however, since then i have had to deal with it several times. i guess i take that back, i have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. i can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. and i know this sounds corney, but every single time i have had to deal with death since then, i have seen a little yellow butterfly. this spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 5 or 6 occasions. well, my 20 minutes is up.

"well here i am sitting in front of this glowing monitor trying not to tell the editor in my head overtake me. it's more difficult than it seems but i must keep trodding. shoot. i just realized i missed a club meeting tonight. i also remembered about the informal classes ill be taking monday. i should also be practicing guitar but i'm too lazy. (homework for that matter) boy it's something else being 27 stories up. people look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. now i don't even know what i'm saying anymore. i feel sick from the food i ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. what else to say. . . . . i remembered i should call peggy since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. oh, and rob, well i need to inform him about the houston concert info. i wonder if those airline tickets to d. c. came in yet. and where are those items i ordered from the catalog? i'm beginning to worry. i cant believe b of a charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an atm. they also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an atm. outrageous. i'm really looking forward to go back home soon. i'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that i bought contact by carl sagan, which i keep intending to read, but never get around to it. i hate that. why did i buy the book? well i thought contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. it's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. carl sagan must have been a brilliant man. my next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. hmm what song is that?. oh yeah, semi charmed life. i should look for those guitar tabs later. that reminds me, should go to the party next door on sat. or not? i suppose it couldn't hurt, but then i'd get further behind on my studies. how long have i been writing so far? hmm. almost 20 min. i haven't really said anything profound which disappoints me, but then again, this is a stream of consciousness assignment. i'm liking college a lot. it gives me space ponder and let my mind wander. it's amazing the places one can go if you just set your mind free. i don't know why, but sometimes i have an impulsive urge to write poems or songs, but once i get distracted from that sudden drive, i lose the will to do so. i guess i have to be in a certain mood. i noticed that i had mere frequent occurrences when i first got here. perhaps it was due to the seclusion and sudden separation from friends and family. being in a strange environment w'o a guardian is harder than i thought. i feel like i'm being forced to grow up faster than i'd like to. but i suppose it builds character, and i have never been one to back down from obstacles. think of it as a gateway to another world. hmm time's up. my train of thought has sure been a wacky one. bunch of random thoughts strewn together. does this represent a part of who i am? certainly, but not hardly. maybe a paradox of some sort. one thought to add is that i have been such a weak willed person lately. i have those intentions, but i cant seem to get them to take root. that needs to change, and i guess i do notice a little improvement, but near as much as i'd like ",0
"it all of a sudden becomes hard to think when you are instructed to. haha. i am so overwhelmed with everything i have to do this weekend. i have so much reading to catch up on in all my classes and i am going to have to do it this weekend or i will never get caught up. i hate biology, i'm so lost, maybe i should drop it before it's too late. but that would be kind of dumb. i don't know how i'm going to pass the first test. i wonder if anyone else is as lost as i am. at least i'll be done with this pretty soon and i will have one less thing to think about. maybe i can get houston to drive on the way home for ashton's birthday. i really don't feel like driving all the way back but i guess i have no choice. wow, i really need to get her something. maybe a she would like a shirt from the co-op. my phone is ringing but it is across the room and i guess since i am being timed it wouldn't be smart to answer it. i wonder who it is. hope it's not too important. i guess i'll just call the number back when i am done with this. i'm really hungry, maybe when i finish this i'll go eat at the cafeteria. hopefully they will have something good because jester city limits is too expensive and not that great either. i doubt they will though, a peanut butter sandwich doesn't sound that bad. my room is so quiet right now, i wish erin would get back so we could go eat. i hate the annoying sound of fans which is the only sound i hear, but our room is too hot without it. i doubt they will ever fix the air conditioner. i really need to order some concert tickets online before it is too late. taking back sunday and saves the day, panic, and so many more i wish i could get but i'm poor. i guess i'll only go to two nights of panic too. i wish i was in a band, then i wouldn't have to be in biology. yay! erin's back and the t. v. is on. i would rather be listening to music but i figured i should do this in silence because if i was listening to music i would just sing in my head the whole time. i can't stand dumb commercials or long ones. erin just reminded me i have to fill out that application. one more thing out of a million. i really need to get on top of things. too bad i'm not more creative or that application would be easier. hmmm only a few more minutes to think. i'm tired too bad i have too much to do or i would take a nap. a shower would be nice as well. i also need to go check my mail. i guess i'll do that when we got eat or something. 5,4,3,2,1. finish!

"sometimes i like stream of conscience writing because when i write fictional or nonfictional stories, that is usually the style of writing i use. i used to write a lot when i was younger and planned on becoming a writer. i stopped at about the 6th grade because that is when i began to focus more on school. i think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades. those institutions should be places for students to want to learn, but now it's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an a in the class. now that i'm in college, i'm trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes i take, whether they are required or not. i still have no idea what i want to be when i """"grow up"""" besides a movie star. i'm open for all sorts of things. when i applied to u. t. i wanted to be a big time advertising ceo, but then i decided that would be selling out too much. within the last couple of months i thought about dental school and becoming a dentist, but i still don't know. i would really like to be a movie star and i plan to save up money and go to los angeles 2 summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs. i know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still don't become famous i haven't even taken a theater arts class since the 9th grade! i don't think taking theater classes do much though, unless one wants to be in theater, but i don't want to stage acting, i want to do films. i think in films to start out with all you need is a little talent (which i think i have) and a good looking face'body (which i am working on. haha) so that's my plan so far. i haven't told really anyone. my best friend thinks that i am going with her to backpack in europe next summer, but i can't afford it at all. i plan on working at a pool hall next summer so i can make a lot of money and save up for my next years apt. and my famous l. a. trip. i would also like to take a bus to new york sometime and live independently. my brother danny did that a few years ago and wrote in a journal the whole time. i would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in a journal. i should probably get a journal now so i can record my little experiences right now, but so far nothing spectacular has happened. i thought that since i'm a freshmen in college i'd be meeting tons of new people and be going on a billion crazy adventures, but i haven't at all. most of the people at u. t. are from my high school (i have at least one person from my high school in each class) so it's hard to branch out and meet new people. i've also been stressing over money lately because i have to pay for everything (books, tuition, housing) myself and i haven't had time to think about doing fun stuff. i just got a wristband for the texas'ou game, i'm not that interested in football though. i like basketball a lot and can't wait until ut basketball season starts though. i would like to make the most of my time in austin, since it's such a beautiful and fun city, but i don't know when to start. i'm going to dallas this weekend, so maybe next weekend i'll hop on one of the buses and tour the city. sometimes i like not knowing where i'm going. i just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of austin away from the campus and the tourist parts. one day my sister and i took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghetto'barrio part of town. it was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus. we saw 3 cute little boys around the ages of 9,10, and 11 and i admired how independent they seemed for such a young age. they got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go, but just decided to go anywhere and i overheard them say """"we've got 2 hours, where do y'all want to go?"""" i think i'm mature compared to my peers at times because i had a dysfunctional family life growing up. through high school though, we moved into an upper class neighborhood and i attended a very affluent high school which i sometimes felt like a liberal outcast amongst a bunch of conservatives. some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off. but it's been 20 minutes so i will finish up. this was very cathartic, i should really invest in a journal!

"today, what am i feeling. actually my roommate and i were talking about how we werer homesick. not in a bad way. we just miss home. i wish i knew what it was about home that i miss. is it the people? no not really considering i didn't have any really good friends when i left home. it it my parents? yeah some of it is that. but there's just this emptiness and i can't figure it out. i also feel like i am in a hella bad mood. it could be pms but it think it is a little too early. i really really hate pms. i get totally irritable and i was noticing yesterday how i felt really annoyed with people. especially my roomate and another friend. i figured it was just cause i was tired and sick of people in general but now i think maybe it is something more. well the stress of school finally begins. i'm remembering how much i hate stress. this stress is alittle different because its mixed with a lot of anxiety. i am a very anxious person at times and i hate it. i get very freaked out when i don't know what is going to happen. i guess you could say i have a big fear of the unknown. when i was applying to high school i used to freak out a lot and have crying fits because i didn't know where i was going to school. then this spring i would have freak out attacks about where i would live. i hate not knowing what will happen in the future. i think its kinda funny that i am a christian yet i struggle with the unknown. part of being a christian is having faith in god to work out all the things he has for you. but i find it really hard to trust in god and just let the fear go. i guess i have my weak areas just like all christians. anyways anxiety, i am really anxious about school. i have no idea what to expect as far as tests and grades. i told myself that because i couldnt drink this semester i would try really hard to get good grades. but it is just so hard to make myself sit down and study. i am areally lazy person and i don't like to work very hard if i don't' have to. i'm starting to ahve doubts about my major. i reaaly love spanish but i'm not sure i'm good enough to pursue it as a major. i guess there are just a lot of people in my spanish class who seem to be so much better that i am at spanish and i get discouraged. anyways, i think my friend graham made a good point when he said that a lot of people didn't place out of spanish hours like i did and that college spanish teaches you a lot morethan high school spanish. i think he was right. but still, i'm just not real sure any more. ugh the people next door play their music so loud. it really is rude. i wonder if we play our music too loud nad jus tdon;t realize it. hmmmm. well time feels like its going by really slowly. perhaps my bad mood is jus t the devil trying to take away from the awesome things god did this weekend. well that's a thought. that retreat kicked some booty!!!!!!

" i hope that i can finish my genetics homework by the middle of this week. and i hope that i can somehow get in touch with my genetics teacher and ta. that's really important to me. i also wish that there was something like key club i could join. so that i could go do some community service. preferably with children. i love kids. they're so cute. today i saw some 1 and 2 year olds playing in the playground outside of church. they were so incredibley cute. ben knew right away that i wanted to take them home. whenever i say that, i'm not actually serious. i just meant that i wish i had some kids, even though i'm only 18 and i plan on staying in school for at least another 6 years. plus the 3 years of residency after medical school. i hope i do well on my mcats. i should probably sign up for that class at the princeton review. either that or i need to start taking time out in my day to practice in my mcat book. and i'm almost positive that i'm going to make it into medical school. there's almost no doubt in my mind. although there is a little, because of some of the statistics that people have been telling me. something about how only 200 people from ut make it into medical school a year. i wonder if it matters that i'm not using hardly any proper grammer or punctuation marks. i almost forgot how to spell punctuation. i used to be a really good speller. and my vocabulary used to fantastic. seriously. it's gone down though, because i just don't read as much. i wish i did. i wish i've read alot of books that daniel has, then we'd have more in common. he's so much like jenny's daniel that it's freaky. they look alike, talk alike, and they even act alike! alike. same. my asian american studies teacher says that those words don't mean the same. i just used that word to describe itself. i'm pretty sure that that's not right, but i guess there's nothing i can do about it. janet's been gone for an hour now. it's alway so lonely without her in the room, but i don't mind it so much. that way, i can actually get some work done. not that i don't get anything done when i'm with her, but obviously she'd be a distraction. and since i get distracted so easily, the less people to talk to, the better. am i supposed to just stop typing at exactly 20 minutes? or will the screen change for me? and what's the point of this anyways? i wasn't in the first class, so i don't have any clue what this is for or if it's a grade. and now i'm listening to some weird music that i downloaded. i guess it really isn't weird, i've just never heard it before. it's kind of like rap. or a mix of some sort. interesting. it keeps repeating i'm a freak, it's a little annoying. hopefully the words will change. if they don't in. 15 seconds. i'll change the song myself. oh what do you know, now it's adding like 3 more words or something. hahaha. does it count that i typed myself laughing? does that even make sense? oh goodness, i'm changing this song. it's getting to me. ahahaha. as soon as i finished typing that, the song ended. that was pretty funny. wow, i've already been typing for 10 minutes. i guess i shouldn't be surprised, i don't ever have a problem just rambling on. my back hurts from hunching over, so now i'm sitting up really straight. i like the rain, except that i don't like the humidity. i just thought of that because i looked out the window and it's getting dark. well, it should be getting dark anyways, because it's almost 8. speaking of the time, why hasn't andy called me? he said he'd call me when he went to go eat dinner today. he always does that. i miss hanging out with andy and ben so much. they're always doing their own thing now, and i guess that's a sign that i need to go out and make my own new friends. but i just like hanging out with them, you know? and i like their friends. especially daniel. i'm always wondering what he's thinking; that boy is so quiet. i wish i knew what he thought of me. i really really wish that andy and ben were more. what's the word? protective? of me. i'd really like it if they called me to do things with them, or just to hang out with them when they're not doing anything. that would make me so happy. i haven't seen thi tran in a week. i wonder what she's up to? i should have called her, but i don't know why i didn't. i had a headache like 20 minutes ago, but after all this random writing and stuff, i've almost forgotten about it. i want to watch some disney movies. i haven't seen one of those in a long time, and they're all so great. i saw part of harry potter yesterday. i love that movie. i talked to daniel though, and he said that he likes the book better than the movie. which i guess is true. book to movie translations are never good. my phone just rang. some lady wanted to know if i had any junior girls and senior boys in my family or something. i have no idea what for. something about research. that was strange. tonight i'm going grocery shopping with janet and steven. she really likes steven. and he really likes her; i've been telling her that all week. it seems that me and janet are really going to get along. i hope so. i love her so much; she's so much fun. oh yeah, so about the book to movie translations. i hated the count of monte crist movie. the new one that is, i've never seen the old one. i mean, the book is my most favorite in the world, and in the movie they had to go screw around with things. and they left out alot of great parts too. it made me so sad that i cried. priscilla and stephanie and josh thought i was funny when that happened. ben and andy were watching black hawk down when we were in the other theater. it's funny how i remember little things like that, but it takes a bit more for me to remember the things that i need to. for example: things i need to do, what to study, things i've studied. and my 20 minutes are almost up. there's 30 seconds or so left. so i suppose that this is the end of my writing assignment. i hope this is sufficient. or i'm going to feel silly. oh well. no time to change it now. bye!

"i hear the innumerable conversations buzzing in the background. why do i constantly attempt to erase my sentences until i get it perfect. i smell nothingness. i should be smelling the moist air of post-raining. but instead, i only hear the faint taps of water breaking. i love college, by the way. and that weird survey you have us take, pretesting, is the most hilarious thing to experience. that survey is so subjective to what you feel at the current moment. damn, my fingers are already cramping. must pop now. it doesn't want to. let's see, how was my day? it was long. it was tiring. ou. damn game. but it turned out to be a nice little long wait with a dear little friend. nothing beats flirting from 8 am to daytime. can i say tits. oh, what the fuck. it feels nice cussing when it is clearly inappropriate to do so for a grade. but, this is what i'm thinking, and to begrudge me for following instructions repudiates the process. whoa, i like when i talk intellectually. i like when i can say that i like talking intellectually without fear of conceit, because no one is here to judge you other than an anonymous psycho analyzer. that was a long word. shit, only 8 gone. it feels like a space of time has gone. i miss my adorable niece. she is the absolutely most beautiful human being. i could sincerely cry at the thought of her pure sweet charm. but i won't lest i go deep into a melancholic cheer. whoa, there i go again. you know, it took me a long time to find the website to do this assignment. there is no emphasis on the paper to reference it's significance. no highlights. no italicizing. i cannot believe how long this experiment is. i want to eat. but i really don't. it's called munchies. and i like food. it's them damn dopamine's. i tell you, for food of course. you better have gotten that play on words, or you're not an astute psychologist. now i'm talking to someone, which makes me a what? i really don't know. that's your job. i'm just thinking what it would be like to be on the other end of this letter. this weird letter of nonsensical discussion to a nonexistent second party. impatience is the motif of this letter. i can't finish it. i enjoy doing this writing but nonetheless want it to end, isn't that contradictory? that's a rhetorical question. i like psychology. it's particularly fun for a writer'slightly intellectual. i would like to minor in it. just for the pure knowledge. sorry, i had to answer my phone. she says, my baby, i love you,"""" and i say, """"i'm typing"""". she goes on asking questions, inconsequential chatting ones. she forgot to eat with her friend. aw, poor chica. she says she felt like a dildo. shit just happens, probably too much.

"today has been the worst and most stressful day ever. all i want is for something to go right! i tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again i've messed something up! i was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that i thought was gone but realized after i had erased half o of it that it was really still there! aahhh! can something please go right? my ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. i don't even know if i'm supposed to push enter when i get near the end of the line but i figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. i just looked at the clock and i've only been writing for four minutes. why does time go by so slowly when it counts. speaking of timing, mine is the worst! i always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. whenever i like a guy i'm to shy, stupid, scared, immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me i have lost interest! or they never have interest in the first place and i find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead of the one who likes me! or in one case i'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when i like him. ahhh! actually i had my chance and now i'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship! ten minutes to go and i'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! i want someone who respects the fact that i'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . which reminds me as i look above my roommate's computer of another guy who i let slip through the cracks even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, i never acted on my feelings, wait a minute i did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. i wish i could play truth or dare with the other guy i like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, i liked you then and i liked you up until i found out there was no chance for us and i resented you a little! someday i'll get up the courage to tell him! it is about twenty degrees fahrenheit in my lovely room in jester east on the tenth floor. the air conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as i type. i have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface, i almost passed out at the draw for the football game against rutgers this saturday, i refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes i will. one minute to go and i'm starting to feel relieved that i wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon i'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. i'm majoring in psychology but i used to want to be an architect. oops, i got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two.

"o. k, so now i'm writing for this assignment. i'm going to turn off the music i'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, i like new order. i like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. i'm probably more into that than most people i know. i wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night i ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. i totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and i crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and i hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was """"bamn"""" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that i still live at home, i still live at home. i'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but i'd like to have my own place. but i don't have the money for that because i pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but i do feel good when i say that to other people, usually at work is when i do that. i work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. i got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that i could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. i keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a """"how are you"""" exchange. things are going better with my parents and i. there was a time before ut,(i'm a transfer from acc)where i didn't really care much about things. probably because i wasn't being challenged, except from work which i enjoyed'enjoy. anyway, i was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob marley type stuff. i have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although i wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. i stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. i wish i was done now. funny because i was looking forward to doing this, but i thought it would be more of a stop'start thought process. it seems like i'm just narrating my last couple of days. i was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and i am somewhat. wish i had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, i have to write for an entire twenty minutes. i wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and """"treated"""". i have avg acne, not really the worst i've had. i am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which i assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because i told her that i would clean it last night because i went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason i like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. i have a good view from the office room where i am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that i noticed that, i noticed i'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to gregory gym and how i can't really yet because i am a gimp. not really though, i could easily tough it out, i'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. i knew i'd miss high school for that reason. i like when i repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when i typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. i was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than i had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something i don't really want to do again, or do i? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished.

"i feel a little behind in everything i am doing for school. i have a hard time reading for long periods of time. my eyes cannot stay focused for very long and words become blurry. it's a constant struggle to understand each sentence. i'm not sure if i have always had this problem. i can read novels fairly easy. i really hate being in class with a lot of people. i don't like to interact with them. they seem to be very clueless over the important parts of the material covered in each session. i'm tired of stupid internet questions that waste class time. if i had a computer question, i wouldn't stop class to ask it and make myself look stupid like most computer illiterate students. students in psychology seem to pretend that they are interested in what is taught, but they really are not fully in to the subject. there are so many students who claim they are psychology majors, when in fact, after they take psy301, they'll change their minds to something over and over until they slide into the working class. i cannot understand many of my peers. their conversations are pointless and insignificant to their life as a whole. they spend so much time conversing over issues that they usually don't care about. i dislike the general public in the college atmosphere. i thoroughly enjoy the professors, but i can't get any intelligent feedback from my peers. i realize i'm not perfect, by any means, but at least i attempt to improve my intellectual state, somewhat. there are way too many sheltered students. i assume that professors have a hard time, especially with freshman, in trying to relate cultural differences. it must be extremely difficult to maintain the patience required to teach any level of pupils. students forget that they are the ones paying for the class and the professor. even in college, they still act as thought they're being forced to attend each session and assigned a certain professor. most of the time, students fail to research their professors before they sign up for their class. i suppose it takes all kinds to make a world.

"i'm hungry, but i don't have any of the food i normally eat. if i had a car, i'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more myoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. if i had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, i wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and i have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to austin at semester. i really don't know where there's room to park a ford expedition in this town, but i'll find some place. my car would have been nice to have last last sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and i ended up not being able to go because i couldn't find a ride. i was pretty upset, but my r. a. danny, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. he was right. i just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that i wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on wednesday. it was a lot tougher than i would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when i look back at it. the one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. i think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. i've never done jump-squats before, so i might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. we didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys i was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. we did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but i wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. i'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. we get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and i've never used one before. i'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if i'm really going to throw up this time. i work out 6 days a week, and i run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so i could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but i'm still not sure how far away i am from the kind of endurance i need for the urgs"""" (rowing machines. ) i would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. i pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the new york airport after a two week cruise through southern europe. we went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and i did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. i was too anxious to get back in the gym, and i never let it heal completely, so about six months later i hurt it again. six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. the therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. apparently i hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. the doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but i was told that i wasn't beyond repair. a full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. if i push myself too hard on the bench press, or if i don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. i'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so i can push myself harder at the gym when i'm training the rest of my upper body. the pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that i can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so i'm happy with the training so far. i was actually worried for a while that i wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if i got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. this means i can still go to the gym, and i actually have more reason now than ever, because i have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that i will undoubtedly be developing. running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout i want, but i'm not sure when i'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. i suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming i make the team, i'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. a few people vomited, one guy passed out, and i heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. i'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but i'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. i can't wait for it to get cold outside, so i can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. it was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. once it gets colder, i'm sure i'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. it'll be a lot colder if i fall in the water too, but i'm hoping that won't happen too often.

"i'm starting to feel tired and lazy. that sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now i feel really comfortable as i sit in this chair and look at the screen. i feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed. i feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down. i'm thinking about going to gregory but i feel so relaxed that i probably won't go. its such a long walk and then i have to come back to my room before i go to another class. i wish my dorm room was closer to gregory, then i think i would go more often. instead i always tell myself i'm going to go but most of the time i just put it off. my back is sore and i think i need to stretch it, my legs are also sore. i know it has to be from all the walking in between classes. i can't wait for tonight. monday night football. my night to sit on the couch and watch tv. i wonder who is playing. i think its the eagles and bucaneers, but i'm not sure. i think the bucaneers have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year. i know for sure the cowboys are going to be bad. they will finish around 6 to 7 wins. if they win more, it will be a successful year for them. i wonder where my roommate is. he always leaves the lights on in our room, so i know he has been home and left already. i really wish i was done for the rest of the day and didn't have another class. i would definitely take a nap. naps are so key. they are rejuvenating beyond anything else. my hair is always in my eyes. i think its time for me to finally get it cut. its annoying now, its too hot to have long hair in my face. also it looks kind of shaggy. i'm taking my shoes off. that feels better. ooh. that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad. ill have to put another band aide on it. i need to start playing basketball more so i won't get blisters when i just play on occasions. the only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play, so i never get the chance to practice my shot. so in the games i end up missing most of the time. fortunately the competition is not real high at gregory. although i have seen brian boddicker and sidwell harris up there at times. i can't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that. what if they got hurt? he would be infuriated. how would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game. does not sound right. you know what else is not right, chance mock starting t quarterback. texas's offense is so predictable with chance at qb. run cedrick benson up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it. that is when chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it. on the other hand when vince young is at qb, you can't predict what is going to happen. he is much more of a threat. he can run, scramble, elude tacklers and throw also, at least that is what he did against new mexico st. i know its the aggies of new mexico st. that we played last week but he did better than chance mock against the same guys. so i think he deserves the start against arkansas this upcoming week. i can't wait to rub it into mic's face when we beat them. i hope he finds a ticket and can come down from arkansas for the game. he will definitely be intimidated by the texas crowd. how long has it been since i have done my laundry? not since i left home i think. i really don't want to do laundry in my dorm room. it takes too long. i think i'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever i go home. probably around homecoming, which is the same weekend as the texas ou game. i can't believe i didn't get a ticket for that. that really pisses me off. i did get lucky though with my season tickets, section 20 row 7, right behind the cannon. that was a pretty good draw for a freshman. still, ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the texas ou game. best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else mack brown should be fired. that would be the fourth year in a row. he can recruit like its nobody's business but he can't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game. straight up he gets out coached every time by bob stoops. what a stud. my fingers are getting a little tired from typing.

" ok. i don't know waht to type right now. im listening to alanis morissette right now and the song is about whether she is good enough for anything. sometimes i feel kind of like this; like im not good enough to do anything. now im stumped again as to waht to write. i talked to my best friend kelly yesterday and she is back home now. she went to taiwan for the summer to do an internship. then she went to california to ride a bus back to round rock. but she kept missing the bus back so she ended up staying in california. im really excited that she came back. i havent seen her in like four months and i didnt get to see her off when she left. i was really sad. sometimes i miss having a best friend here. kelly is my best friend in all but she has her schedule and family problems and a lot of times i just miss having a best friend to do everythign with. haley, one of my other friends used to do a lot with me. . almost everything. but this summer she got a job and her dad got a raise so now that she has more money, it seems like she is too good for me. i don't like people like that. there is someone at our room door. haley and i were suppost to go to breakfast one morning and had planned it all out. but then the morning of the event, she had one of her other friends, jennifer, call me and tell me haley couldnt make it because of a doctors appoinment. i was like, why can't haley call me herself. then she tries to play it all off. i don't really have anything to say to her now. i havent seen her on campus since classes started and weve only talked online about two or three times. thats not much compared to how much we used to talk. twenty minutes is a long time to continuously type. i guess its not too bad for people who type slow but for those who type kind of fast, this just makes for a lot of nonsense talking' typing. ok. this semester im taking karate' tae kwon doe. its really fun but a lot of work. i signed up for the class because i thought it wouldnt require too much work - aside from the work out - but actually this class has books and i have a three to five page paper due in it. its the only class i have a paper due in this semester. how odd is that?. oh well, it should be fun either way. this alanis morissette music is some really angry music.

"good morning. eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours. they say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but i feel ten is a little more at par. i'm trying to wake up so the music of the late elliott smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to. it's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, i don't think i could have got better roommates. i love sitting at my laptop when i wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath. our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying. it's absurd really. so monday night i found out from some of my friends in college station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there. damn aggies. can't live with them, can't kill them. it's a cruel world. but i'll be better off without her i think. i talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart. where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit. but you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face. but i suppose it's like morgan freeman says in the movie seven, """"love costs, it takes effort. """" that's true. back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves. he told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases. for instance alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt. god she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author. but she has no conscious knowledge of art. ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money. and well obviously she doesn't know what """"love"""" really is. but then again maybe i don't either. but i know i loved her, i believed her lies. i bought the false love she was selling for cheap. i still love her i suppose, i can't deny it. but she loved herself, before she loved me. and now i have to do the same. i have to be strong and let time heal all. another thing my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing. like i was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life. she had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing. and i quote ben harper, """"so many people to love in my life, why do i worry about one?"""" i know there are better people out there so. and i have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever. i honestly felt bad after i chewed her out and she was crying. try and figure that one out. i suppose i'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last. but i don't believe that saying. nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end. i believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them. i'm glad i don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much i enjoy college compared to high school. high school, what a joke. you are not pushed, you are not inspired. in high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd. to conform and be normal. i always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country. but then again i am just one person. so i try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by. i guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace. i try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions. i think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not. for instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car. just relax and roll down the windows and cruise. but if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable. it's sad when people don't care important issues. i guess i just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc. i think life is a crazy thing. a conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action. i think that maybe one day, i'll have all the answer, and then i will die. maybe one day i will find a love that is true. maybe. maybe i think too much.

"i have been typing friends and family for a while now, and i noticed today that my most creative writing is then! when i have no worries, no cares, and just let go of all those ideas that i keep losing when it comes to the time when your dreaded english class requires a ten page paper. < and i'm wondering why this line will not stop, this page must be really long! wow, or the typing very small. (deep breath), the guy next to me just passed out onto his keyboard but- up(!) he's okay. back to the computer idea. i believe that sometimes computers get mad at me for figuring them out, so they crap out completely. just simply have no cure at all. the one story i want to tell is short and sweet, but a little scary. it is the reason why i thought i'd never use a computer again, but i went against my promises, and forced myself to join this growing, technological world once again. this is really difficult. i wasn't going to write this in the lab, but i have a large space of time between my two classes today, a four-hour space. which is good, i do believe. i think that there are some people at the labs who are a little too curious about what is being written on computers next to them. ya know, """"i wonder what other people are up to?"""" i admit that i've looked at a few words typed up on someone else's screen, but not as rudely as the guy who is sitting next to me. possibly, if i tell him straight out, he'll stop, but, nope, i'm a little too shy for that. i think he'll catch on if he reads this. get a life! no, that is a little cruel. i actually have changed my mind. you can read my screen if you want. i changed my mind after i saw the movie """"dream with the fishes"""" very good movie. it won't be out on the screen by the time you read this i don't think. i may actually be gone by then too. i wonder. how can you stand reading -actually, i changed my mind. i'd enjoy reading people's true odd thoughts. but i like to put a visual subject to their writing, i like to know what their appearance is. i ask myself, is that wrong to want to know what that person looks like? i really don't give a shit about what i look like once i'm out in public, but -i got off the whole point- some people's beliefs have to be proven by their actions, and sometimes their actions will be expressed through the appearance. these are such strong words that can honestly screw someone over; especially if they are into politics. what the hell, i need to read back and see what i was aiming for. oh, the guy who likes to read the screen, and the movie (!) it's time to compare and contrast. in """"dream with the fishes"""", one of the two main characters, the one who's point of view is taken throughout the movie, he is a very simple, depressed, and desperate, business man. his favorite pastime (which the second character made him admit to him) was looking at people through his binoculars, through the city windows, across to the apartment buildings. this is a really good movie, i suggest seeing it. okay, i'm going scatter again. well, the second character knew all along that the business man watched him, but didn't mind. he knew that it was all the business man had, so he let him. this was not the main portion of the movie or anything, it's not that dull, it was just a simple twist to make the movie a little more unique. that brings me to another point, why must people spend so much time making movies which resemble fifty other movies? maybe a hundred or more? i don't even bother to go to the ones with same plots, or no plots. but i am a movie freak! i might even want to get into that someday. i'll have to improve on my grammar a bit, and get used to being in the dark a lot, with fictional, or replayed stories being projected in front of me. i could do that. but i think my interests will take their own path, according to availability. oh! i just remembered that i need to get some toothpaste, and possibly some other stuff, but being a typical college student, i think i can only afford toothpaste. i have noticed around here that these kids around me are very rich actually. (with a sly movement of the eyebrow) what's up with that? this is supposed to be real life right? well, another form of real life just growled at me, i'm starving, and must go. thank you very much if you read this. you know a few secrets which i would tell no one. well, not real individual secrets, just train of thought that i would never admit to someone else. and although you have my name, it's no matter cause i don't know who you are. see ya ",1
"somehow i just submitted an blank assignment so hopefully this one will submit when it is completed. i should be studying for my first astronomy test right now. somehow i managed to put it off until the last minute like i did with this writing assignment. i need to break this procrastination problem before i get any further into the semester. i have this problem every fall that i have been in college. in spring i am fine i get everything done ahead of time. i am sure it has nothing to do with fall or spring. i am hoping this fall my grades will be awesome but it is hard adjusting to a new environment. i just transferred to ut after 2 years at the university of north texas. i have been living here now for almost three weeks. i feel like i'm on vacation or something. while i miss my old apartment and friends, i am very happy to be here at ut. i couldn't get in to ut directly after high school because of my class rank. i didn't really concern myself with school in high school. suddenly when i started at unt academics became more important to me and my grades improved. i applied to ut expecting to not get accepted because i had heard horror stories of how hard it is to transfer in. it came as a complete surprise when my parents called and told me i got a letter of acceptance. i instantly decided that i was ready for the move. it never really hit me that i was leaving my friends behind in denton until now. i think i offended one of my closest friends in denton because i was so excited about moving and didn't really seem to care that i was leaving. suddenly two weeks before i moved she decided irrationally that she never wanted to speak to me again. oh well. i love austin.

"i got home from burnet today from hunting and it wasn't that great. the dove weren't flying when i was there maybe its because i'm bad luck. sometimes i think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before i got there then when i got there i didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else. super smells really good right now i think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs. sounds really good because i'm so hungry i haven't eaten all day. speaking of not eating all day i just realized how fun my weekend was. that's why i haven't really eaten that much. food sounds so good. friday night i went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in. even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in. i'm pissed. from now on when i have a party i'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls. some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool. anyway, then i went to the ut game on saturday and we stomped all over north texas. i kind of felt bad but not really. its weird to be at a ut game and say """"this is my school.

"i can't believe i am doing this, and that i actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that i have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least i think that is what you call it. to tell you the truth it is actually easier than i thought it would be, i expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. but i guess i am coping with it and handling it the best i can. though i am always afraid that i will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. actually, that is a true nightmare that i have had before. which reminds me that i have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. which i guess is because i have just moved here from a really small town. and when i say small, i mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. now compared to that austin is a real shocker. i guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. so many things are different and yet so many things are the same. a funny thing happened when i first moved here a week ago, i found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. just think of how many apartment buildings there are in austin, and i unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. and she and i only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other, i am already looking forward to the christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. i am so tired of this ninety degree weather. i can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. but i guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. that reminds me that i have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because i am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and i want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. more than likely it won't rain, but i know that if i don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. i don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually i don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so i finally told him that we would come watch him this friday. he's supposed to be really good. but i don't even remember what position he plays anymore. the reason that i don't really like football is that i don't understand the rules very well, and i think that if i knew them better then i would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. i am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. i like to do more calm, less active things. one of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. i wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. i wonder how long that marriage will last. but i am glad to be going to her wedding, because i will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. i haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. well, i am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so i must end here.

"its 12:42 and i'm listening to an old episode of saturday night live in my friends' room. i need a computer. i don't know why i didn't bring mine. i'm hungry. i can't eat because i have to type this assignment. sharon has a lot of pictures. this is a pretty funny snl sketch. i have nothing to say. my back feels a little sore. i'm slightly offended that there aren't any pictures with me in them. i don't want to do this anymore. i want to watch tv, instead of just listening to it. i really don't have anything important going through my head. it was nice of sharon to let me stay in here and do this. her and her roommate left, so i'm not even sure i'm supposed to be here. this song isn't that bad. i have never heard of the musical guest on this episode of snl but the song really isn't bad. i really should have eaten before i started this. i'm about to pass out. only 12 more minutes. i should call home later. i'm quite upset that i couldn't do the pretesting survey thing for the experiments. maybe i'll try again in a little while. i want to change the channel. some station has to be showing the u. s. open. they just have to. i think someone keeps trying to i. m. sharon, but i can't tell them it isn't her, because i'm doing this. i'm interested how this assignment will tell how my mind works. it should be good to know. i hope someone explains it, preferably professor what's his name. i would check to see what his name is, but again, i can't. just looking around the room now. this is kind of boring (no offense). only 8 more minutes. cool. the only bad part is i have to stay here until sharon and rebecca get back because i can't lock up. there are just a lot of pictures in here. there are many of sharon's boyfriend jorge. interesting that she's dating someone with the same name as me, isn't it. snl is over and only 6 minutes until i'm done. that is a stupid picture sharon has next to her printer. i like the opening music on this show (the kids in the hall). only 4 minutes left. that's good because i am still very hungry. this is very boring. i thought about using a lot of big words, but i realized that that isn't how i think so i should just stick with my sixth grade vocabulary. this isn't a very funny sketch. phone's ringing, can't answer it. they told me not to. it's rebecca. she knows i'm here but i still can't answer the phone. she isn't going to like this. i'm done.

"here goes. do you mind if i write a story. i'm a lot better a stories than i am about talking about my real life. the stories are more exciting, anyway. did you note that i used a space in between a and lot? a day for something once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago or something rather to that effect, (not affect), people lived in gray boxes. these boxes were called people boxes, because there were people inside them. but all of a sudden, people starting thinking that there might be something outside of those tiny, cramped, dirty boxes they were inside of. so they came out and looked around. but they were wrong. there was just a lot more of the same around them. yea. happy, nice, story. i think it means something about """"man's glorious ascension through time"""" or something to that effect. here's another one. i'm pretty good at stories, but not much else. at least you'll have fun reading these, but if you don't, i'm still pretty sure the dumping sites aren't completely filled up yet. the wonderful talking box of harvey glumgill sorry. the title is wrong. but it sounds better than nothing, right? here we go. this story isn't about much at all. it's about some crazy people who believed some retarded things and ended up being dictators of small, third world nations. -""""we are sorry to inform you that the last paragraph was written by somebody who has just been sacked. however, to continue the mindless assignment, it will be continued and stuff.

"right at this very moment i am feeling very anxious and very stirred up. i am thinking about everything that is due this week and i am very nervous. not the good kind of nervous that keeps you on your toes, but the kind that makes you want to vomit. i am sitting here typing this paper and not really knowing what i am going to write next. i am kind of stuck right now on what to type, but the assignment calls for us to write exactly what pops into my head while typing, and i guess this is it. i am thinking that i should be someplace right now i think that i may have missed something important all of a sudden. that is really scary. i hate that feeling. i am really tired right now and could really use a nap. i tossed and turned all last night and couldn't fall asleep. i woke up about every hour wondering where i was and if i had overslept and missed my class. man i need some sleep. i really want to go home now, i am tired of this school already and i haven't even been here a week. i keep telling myself it will get better, it just has to, but i am really not sure of anything at this time. my life has been turned upside down, i have left the comforts of my house to come down here, and apparently i am supposed to be educated. i really don't think that i am going to be too much more educated than i already am. i think that college is just more of a matter of survival than skill. and i am paying plenty of my hard earned money to go here and be tortured like this. man i wish my parents had enormous amounts of money so i could just come down here like some people and just play and have a good old time, but no i am here and i can't flunk out, because i am not able to drop any courses, or else i will not be considered a full time student. if that isn't stress i don't know what is. anyways that seems to be my thoughts about the grand university of texas right now. i have a feeling it might change within the next couple of weeks. it had better, or else i may not make it here. i considered just up and walking out and never coming back. it kind of seems like a bad idea. i am thinking also that i should not be having to write this paper if nobody is going to be grading it. i think it is a waste of my time. but apparently it isn't if it will help my grade. it seems really pointless to me that i have to write this paper for nobody. these walls are really green and who puts green and white carpet to cover walls. walls are not supposed to be carpeted. i am the only person that is writing a paper right now and i think that i am being really loud. nobody is saying anything but i know that they are looking over here watching and looking to see what i am doing making all that click click of the keys on the keyboard. spanish is really going to kick my butt! i do not really comprehend anything and how i don't want to go to that class after i write this paper. i have about four minutes of writing left. what joy it brings me knowing that i am almost done with this assignment. what if i have done the assignment wrong? what if this is one of the papers the graders actually read and they think that it is bad and they give me a big fat f for my grade. argggg! i think i am going to give myself an ulcer by the end of this semester! it seem like all i have on the brain is school school, school. i get to go to the football game this weekend. matt is going to come home and i get to see him. i guess that will be some fun. i am glad that i don't live in stephenville. i need to call him either tonight or tomorrow and see where i am supposed to pick him up at on friday. there is a picture of a paper clip with a light bulb over its head and it is winking at me. that is really irritating. they really need to take that off of the computer program. who ever comes up with some of this stuff? i wish i could just sit in an office all day and come up with ideas about different things. i think that would be fun. i really need to spell check this document now. the weekend is almost here. what fun. the paper clip is asking me what i want to do now. a talking paperclip, who would have ever thought.

"its hard to think what comes in your head naturally when you're told to do it. i wonder what my pledge brothers are doing now. i was having fun. i should've gone to these classes more so i would know this was coming up. i guess skipping class for the band makes it worth it though. when is chris going to move up here? i hope they don't make me depledge for the band, that's just dumb. its all michael's fault anyway. he's just pissed that he didn't pledge and now he's left out of everything. well that's not my fault. i hope catherine doesn't think i'm weird. i just figured i could ask her to the party cause most girls want dates. maybe she did want to go but who knows now? ill ask cat pat. whatever. i've fallen in love like 30 times a day since i moved in here anyway. i want to play my guitar. college is cool except classes get in the way. if i could just play my guitar all day, id be a happy man. besides, the only way we can consider ourselves growing in intelligence and intellect is when we realize more and more how ignorant we are. animals may not speak to each other in words, but they also don't kill each other for reasons other than food and defense. we do. that's a good thought. i need to put that into a song. we only get smarter when we realize how ignorant we truly are. maybe this paper will be worth a damn. ah well, i wonder if people are going to know i write all the lyrics to our songs? i bet they wont since michael sings them all. its like the motley crue deal where no one knew that six wrote the words and vince just sang em. he sucks at singing anyway. i hope he doesn't read this one, i should watch my language. whatever. man is bekker going to call or what? she gets all pissy that i haven't talked to her and now the first chance i get i've called and she hasn't called back. that's probably what she wants though, me to start thinking about her. oh well, she's hot. i which there was a way to write out these blank spots in my train of thought where i don't even know what i'm thinking about. i bet i do but the memory isn't there so i don't know by the time i'm about to type it. i guess i just put those blank spots into words though. good job matt. wow, only half way done. i wonder how my high school football team is doing. i can't believe i made it through that. adolf as my coach for three years?! that's amazing. i'm proud of myself, no one expected someone like me to stick with it. now all the older frat guys respect me cause i played against half of em and i never stayed down. hell, one of them walked on at ut. i wonder if i'm going to be spending the rest of my life challenging myself or if ill one day be secure in how i am. i wonder if i need to be using punctuation and capital letters. i bet his computer thingy is going to mark my paper as something to check cause it wont make sense with the punctuation and capital letters missing. whatever, hell read it and think i think i'm cool since i rambled on for 10 minutes about high school football. i enjoyed that class last time, i need to start going to class every day. damn matt, you're going to screw up college and you're smart as hell. this is why you're stuck home tonight with a twenty minute paper and an astronomy test both tomorrow. i bet i have something in spanish but forgot. i've been to that class every time though. if every class took roll, i don't think id survive. weird that i never once skipped a class in high school. no detentions, aep, nothing. i was good as hell. i guess my mom working there influenced me at first and then it was just a habit once i realized i owned my mom so i never had any desire to skip. i guess now that the band has a chance to do something good cause were not stuck in houston anymore i can skip. i see it more like this band is like another person having an internship at a law firm. they want to be a lawyer but their parents made them major in cooking or something. would they skip the internship for cooking? hell no, neither would i. i'm going to skip cooking. or class in general. i'm going to be happy dammit and i'm not happy unless i'm playing in the band. just hope my parents don't find out. maybe if i do well this semester then they wont watch as much next so i can put even more focus on music. who buys a ball of rubber bands? why is this ball here? why am i not on my own computer? why can't they just make it and ship it? this sucks man, johns going to start getting annoyed that i'm on so much. oh well, at least he's not here now. i can't believe he knocked my guitar over this morning. i can't believe i slept through my alarm this morning. i want to sleep. whatever i'm done with this. i'm going to study astronomy now. yet another class that's been avoided.

well i start typing now. so i don't really know my computer stopped making the fan noise why does it do that. the simpsons are on next door i could watch that but i'm stuck doing this oh well what is that oh yeah i like that i'm full even though the food is not good its all you can ear i love all you can eat. well since i don't really know what to talk about i can just write about things that i my phone rang can i answer it i don't think so oh well ill call them back i hope it was not jb calling about the hell raiser meeting damn oh but i can write bout things i don't really talk to other people bout like when i left i didn't really expect robyn and i to last really although i wanted to and but now it is not really that hard and i love her but kinda find myself wishing it was harder so that i could hav an excuse if i needed one to get out. but i have differing opinions on it mostly cause one moment i miss her and jus want to hang out with her but the next i get annoyed that i have to talk to her. and when other girls talk to me here i feel like i shouldn't even though there is no reason not to and robyn wouldn't even care the slightest cause she is so understanding and this is why our whole thing is not that hard. cause she makes it easy. that's the main reason i stayed with her cause usually i don't have relationships ever. this is mainly my first and definitely my first serious one which is another thing sometimes it seems so serious i'm like back off but when she acts casual i want her to act more serious. i guess the whole thing is stupid and i shouldn't worry bout it cause i am easy going and i should let things go with the flow i'm going to call dusting when i'm done so i can see if he is going to the hell raisers. wow it is quiet in here with no music i want to turn on ole kenny but ill wait 10 min left this is going by fast. i thought i was barely talking. i wish i knew her name i talk to her everyday and she is in 3 of my classes and she introduces me to people and i don't even know her name that's kinda fucked up but i could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name. that would work i wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all i really do anymore is read and study. quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh i am talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy i'm going to his room in well 13 53sec so i can wait no 20 - 1353 well 1412 now but yeah i think i'm going to work out after the meeting. i wonder if they let anyone in that 70s show is on i hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man a guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night. it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with a pistol right in front of her. robyn felt bad but i didn't know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in a long time so to me it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. this is getting long now that i'm looking forward ahead in the direction of i'm thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired i'm not blinking i need to ok wow that burned i shut them for like 5 sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny i burped and hiccupped at the same time. i wonder what this is going to say about me i don't really care though cause i think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on a lot of levels the lie detector was cool though i think i could beat it maybe but well that's all ,0
"this is really weird. what am i doing here. what am i supposed to write about. who came up with this assignment anyway. well whatever. ill just do it and ill get the credit and that's it. i wonder where nauman is right now. i called him but no answer. where could he be. i had fun this weekend. i think. well it was better then what i normally do, stay home and watch tv. i wonder what woren and sahara are up to. i don't spend anytime with friends anymore. i want to go back to dallas and see everyone. well i guess i can do that this weekend when i go back. its hot in here. its so hot everywhere. well actually i don't want to go back home this weekend. in a way i do, and in a way i don't. i feel like i'm keeping a journal. oh crap i think my contacts are about to pop out. see if i go home this weekend, then i will be giving up freedom. but if i don't go home this weekend then, my parents will be like why don't you want to come home? do you like austin that much that you don't even want to come see your family anymore?? which of course is not true. i actually don't like austin. well it smells everywhere in austin. dobie smells, dobie garage smells, wal-mart smells, foleys smells, everywhere, austin stinks, literally. i wonder how farzana and carey are at baylor. i'm glad they came down this weekend. otherwise i would have been bored off my butt. you can really count on family to be there for you when you need them. but sometimes it can be really annoying. like my mom, everyday, what did you do, did you go to class, did you eat, what did you eat. it gets on my nerves. but i love her. i guess i am kind of looking forward to going home. i mean i get to see all my friends again. and sabeen is going to dartmouth so i can say bye to her to before i leave. but i think the hardest thing to do will be the transitions on friday and sunday. i'm here now and i want to stay here, not keeping moving again and again. i hate change. and then if i go home this weekend, then ill have to pack and say goodbye to everyone on sunday, and i hate good-byes. they are so sad and then when i'm say bye, ill want to come back to dallas, and ill hate austin even more. that's why i don't want to go back. this feels kind of good like typing all this. maybe ill start keeping a log or something so i can put all my thoughts in it. my hands are getting tried now. i never realized how long 20 mins really was. how much longer do i have? 8 more mins. great. where in the hell is nauman? what is he doing?? i'm going to call him after this and see if he's there now. he better be. i miss him. i wonder if he misses me too. i hope so. when is he coming back to austin. i could go see him this weekend, but we both know that's not going to work. his friends are all going home this weekend so he'll want to spend time with them and his parents are out of town so i'm sure he'll want to go out with them. but then what about me? what about unlimited weekends??? rrahhh. this is frustrating. i wonder if he is still in love with him old girlfriend. i think he is. but whatever. i don't care. he can be in love with him old girlfriend. who cares. i'm just going to let things happen. i mean that is the best way right. you can't make someone fall in love with you. actually i myself don't know if i really like him. its weird. when i'm not with him, i really want to be with him and when i'm with him, its just ok. i mean i do like spending time with him, he's really funny and the time flies when where together, but its just not what i expect it to be. i guess it will just take time. ok 3 more mins. great. that wasn't that bad. i guess ill do the other assignment tomorrow since you can't do both on one day. i have so much to do today. that stupid ba 101 assignment is due today and i have to d the prestesting for psy, but the stupid webpages isn't working for it. just my luck, since i want to use it, its not working. i wonder if i really have to read those 2 books for class tomorrow. if we do, i'm screwed. i wonder what mona and charu look like. he talks about them all the time. i wonder if i met them, what they would think of me and what he has told them about me so far. where is he. let me go call him right now! should i email him? well if i could ever get my stupid email to work, i would. how come he doesn't email me? oh yeah , wait he does doesn't he. i don't know how he emailed me when he was here. i mean i wouldn't have done it if i was him. i don't think at least. i mean he had a girlfriend and everything going. how did he do it? well whatever it was, i'm glad he did. ok good times up.

"well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. i've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when i got here i had no clue it was going to be just what i thought is was going to be like. needless to say, i'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. i'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that god sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and i had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but i guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh? i'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. i'm busy as it is. friends will come. i wish matt from orientation calls me. i think we could be really good friends. i'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. i just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. i just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. i absolutely love college but i guess i miss all of the tight friendships i had and my little group at school. but i love everything about college (except for the showers) :) well, that's it for now. besides the fact that i wish i had some significant other. or maybe i don't. sometimes i wish i did but i still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and i'm still meeting people now so i guess it's good i'm not tied down. and i'm really excited i found a theater club i could join here. and i don't have to major in theater. i did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but i was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. i'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. i miss my friends and family the most. i'm not really homesick yet, which is good i think. i think that shows a sign of maturity. i'm not going home this weekend. i know my parents would want me to but i don't really feel like it yet. i propbably will the next weekend maybe. i know i am for our high school's homecoming for sure. i think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. i think that it will be fun. i loved high school football games. i went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 20 minutes. until writing #2.

"its been 2 weeks now that i have been in college. i havent made that many new friends, but at least i have been trying. i go and meet new people, peobably most of whom i will never meet again, but it's fun still to just go and meet people. i look at my friends from high school, and they just sit around with each other. to me, they don't seem to be getting the new life experience, high school all over again. i think college will be a great time to see new things in my life. maybe figure out what i want to be as a person. as far as girls, there are many on the campus, but i don't know how many i have a chance with. sometimes, i feel like my religion holds me back, but i know its something that i want to keep. its like a respect factor. i hope the girl is out there. i do regret sometimes when i know i should go talk to girl, but instead i just go somewhere else. im not that shy, but i feel girls always think they're being hit on. the better thing to do is to go for it anyway, and who cares what they think. the things that happen during this time in our life, i wonder if this stuff really even matters that much. i mean how much is this stuff really going to affect me later on, or should i even bother with all this stuff. people tell me that it does matter and its all part of life, but i don't really know. i think sometimes i think to much about what other people are thinking. like act differently towards different people, which something i don't like doing. also, i think i judge too quickly. i finally opened the door to the my dorm yesterday; stupidly i didnt do so before. i met some people, they seemed pretty nice. i want to meet some girls though, so if nothing else, my confidence will be boosted up. i usually not really needing self-assurance, but what can i say, it is a bit different here. as far as jennifer goes, well im trying to be friends with her. i think i can be, it doesnt really matter anymore. i think she finally realizes it as well. in life, i think we all make many friends, so it doesnt really matter that much i guess. also, i noticed when i make a point i think about the opposite as well. like maybe i should try to stay friends with her, what if she turns out to be a life long friend. i like it when im just in a relaxed mood, when stuff doesnt bother me. just chilling and not worrying about anything. school hasnt been that bad so far; i know i need to pick it up. studying hard right now will pay off for me a lot. i guess writing in a journal does help. it makes me feel releaved of some emotions. i want to go to that party tonight, but i don't know how i will get there. psychology class should be fun, i like the material we are covering, hope it's not too hard though. im worried about calculus, that class is going to be tough. sheena, well i don't know about her. she's cool, but i don't know. she's really hesistant, and i don't really trust her. seems like she's really good friends with a lot of people. i mean i want to make some new friends, meet some nice girls, and make good grades. simple goals. this 20 minute segment is really long. im getting tired of writing. i want to go club tonight, i hope i can get a ride up there. i have study too, so if i don't i can always just study. all the same.

"well then where do i begin. let's see. i need a haircut. i should have gotten one when i went home labor day weekend. but i didn't. i wanted to go home this weekend, really only so i could get a haircut, but i didn't. my hair is getting entirely too long. at least for me it is too long, i mean i don't have a pony tail or anything but still. i forgot to see when i started writing. oh well i'll just estimate. i really need to get a cell phone. of course i would turn it off in my psychology class unlike some dumb asses in there. i mean how stupid do you have to be to not check and see if your phone is on even after the professor tells you to make sure they are off. i suppose they might leave it on once or forget they have it in their backpack or perhaps their friend put their phone in their bag and forgot about it, but it can't help but kind of piss you off when a phone rings in class. all i think is, """"what a dumb mother fucker. """" hey look, microsoft word doesn't recognize the word fucker. hey it doesn't even recognize the word microsoft. my head itches. because my hair is too long. i need to go to the optometrist and get new contacts. i think i've had these for over a year now. i'll probably get them the same color, aqua. man it is hot outside, it must be about 98 degrees. not that i am any good at estimating but hey. like i can't estimate a girls weight worth a shit. or a person's age. of course if a guy is smart, he doesn't try to estimate a girls weight. i need to go to the restroom. my stomach is growling. man my nose is itching too. i miss jenn. damn she is beautiful. i wonder if she's thinking about me right now. she is probably in 7th period right now, whatever class that is for her. i wonder if she is pregnant. if she is it's probably mine. great, just great. i'm fucked. then again that's what got me in this position in the first place. speaking of positions, i wish jenn was here now. i want to go home this weekend. not so i can go home this weekend, but so i can get a haircut and see jenn. i wish i had my car so i could just go wherever i wanted whenever i wanted. then i would probably be out partying and stuff all the time.

"hello. my name is neha shah, and i'm a freshman this year. so far i love ut and i'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and i actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing i really fear is that i will slack off. i am great at doing my work, and i know that i will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, i have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, i'm not homesick at all. i'm actually doing very well here. i met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that i've come close to two of the people that i met. one of which i am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. i finally gained the confidence in myself and i gained so much to my self esteem. on a normal, day to day basis, i try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever i'm feeling down. my friends and family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone i love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when i have a problem, and i know that. he's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when i left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, i've recieved about 4 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. i'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. i am so proud of being indian, and i'm also very proud to be part of the family that i'm in. i wouldn't change that at all. i grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. i like growing up there, but i really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way i'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone i need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something i really wanted. i wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. i had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. i love it. i like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, i love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when i went to new york city a couple of years ago, all i wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, i like to live life like that. doing things i by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. i've always been independent and i'm fairly sure that's becuase i take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because i'm the older child. i like doing things on my own, so then i know if i make a mistake, i can fix it. i don't like depending on others all the time, but i love being with people. i know those are two contradicting statements but i do have those that i rely on, and i do consider connections when i need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, i love my life. i can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and i want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and i hope to succeed with great pride.

" i'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because i attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59. very ironic. i feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. i have a lot to do and i don't feel like doing anything. i wish i could just go to sleep. i need a lot of attention from people these days and i'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and i'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe i'm just overreacting though, because i seem to do that so well. i don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and i smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. i have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5. i don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully i will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. i need to realize that i can make myself happy and i don't need someone else to make me happy. i don't even know why i'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head i suppose. i hope i get a new car. my dad said i can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. it will probably be something crappy like i have now. but i can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue i was starting to stress that i was going to get too far behind. i really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though i do try but i need more. i need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that i might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. i might stay at the appartment tonight but i probably won't because i have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens i suppose. i think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like i said i'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. i'm so tired right now i could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but i can't do that because i have entirely too much work to do. tonight i want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and i want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. i hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but i'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. i'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. i don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. i just hope it counts to him. oh well. i met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and i hope i get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. i'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san marcos and go see some people that i haven't seen in a long time. i hope i can scrounge up something to wear, because i need to do laundry and i need to go shopping, i have like no clothes anymore, i don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if i see her this weekend. i hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. i don't know what but i don't really like it. i'd rather just stay here and study or like watch tv then go home and feel awkward with my family. i have so much to do and i'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. i can already see that college is going to be very hectic. i hope i can handle it alright. wow the time is up.

" right now i'm thinking how much easier it would be to write assignment number 2. if there are no right or wrong things to write, i guess i should not worry. i believe i worry too much. it is hard to make this paragraph line up, the ends of each line that is. right i feel blank but the nice thing is since i wrote it out, my assignment is not a blank. if all assignments were this easy, i'd worry less. i'm hot, hungry and tired. all a result of college life i guess. so far, the class has been interesting. i have a feeling the class will get more serious. i generally stay away from computers, technology intimidates me. i like the simple things in life but the entire world is advancing so i must. for example, i am turning an assignment through the internet. its pretty crazy to me. my typing is slowing due to an interest in a video that is on and extreme hunger. i be hitting the submit button now.

" it's 11:30 and my roommates still aren't up. do i like them? do i hate them? it's goes back and forth. i'm sure they have their good qualities, but damnit - it's 11:30. i am now feeling the sensation of eye drops in my eye, and dripping down my cheek. i have pink eye - who gets pink eye except little kids? i guess i do. thinking, what am i thinking. i am hoping i do not gain weight at college! last night was fun, it's nice to meet new people even though some of them were scary! i can't believe that guy got beat up! i hope i don't fail out of college in my first semester. rumor has it, at ut they give you the first full year - then it's tough luck. we'll see. maybe my homesickness will vanish before it majorly appears if i m home after a year. home - i hate home. no i don't, i love it. but some of the people i had to escape. andrew, i thought i loved him! he loved me! what the hell happened? why won't he try to talk to me? i'm not a bad person - or am i? jesus, i tell you - i just don't have a plesant history with the men. i need to brush my teeth. the raisin bran was really nice though - i can still taste it. it doesn't taste as good when the morning breath is mixing with the flavor of such sweet cereal. i wonder what my brother is doing. what my friends are doing, what my parents are doing! i hope everyone is ok. i hope my parents are doing well. i hope they're adjusting to having no kids at home. i really miss them, they're the best. i have to do well here for them. i wonder if they'd let me move back in with them. i could do housework or yardwork for room and board - sure, they'd like that. no work for them, just plesant little beth home again. no, i'll do fine. it's up to me to do what i need to do. i wonder who's going to read this. i wonder what they'll think of me. i hope i don't have psychopathic tendencies! that would be great - there's that girl beth, psycho! haha, i wonder if that's what people think of me now. isn't it funny you can go through life and never know what another person is thinking? i mean, sure, you can say you know - but the bottom line is you never really will. that's so crazy. most of the time i don't even know what i'm thinking! wow, this world is really crazy. this assignment is making me philosophical. i kind of like it. do i sound like a genius? oh, ims are popping up. how nice it is to be able to speak to people over the internet. it's kind of sad though. i'd much rather talk on the phone - or would i? i suppose it, like everything, has it's ups and downs. i wonder what andrew is doing now. if he's met a new girl. or even if he's hooking up with my friends. or should i say, friends . craziness. you think you know a person. what am i talking about? i knew him for four days. but he'd never had a history of being an ass. i wonder what'll happen when i go home. will anything? everything happens for a reason. i'll just keep believing that. i wonder what tests i'll get into for this class. i'm interested in the experiments. hmmm. i am tired. i can't smell a damn thing. or can i? that smell of nothingness. is that even something? it has to be, otherwise it wouldn't be there. yes, i am smelling nothingness. it's not too bad. it would be awesome if nothingness had a wonderful smell, like cherries, or fruit. but then i wouldn't appreciate the smell of those things otherwise, so i suppose nothingness is better. wow, god was smart. he had it all planned out. i wonder if he's watching me now. i hope i'm not disappointing him. sometimes i think i'm a disappointment. but, i'm not so bad i guess. my roommates are still sleeping. who are these people? am i a bitch? i can't help it - they're nothing like me. not that that's bad, but we share nothing in common. i wonder if they hate me. that would be funny. another story to tell the kids. crazy beth and the roommates that hated her. i am so weird. i am so tired. i will go to the gym. i will lose weight so i will go home and be sexy and hot. no, i'm not doing it to go home, i'm doing it for me. i want to be confident. i wonder what it's like to be confident. my stomach is grumbling. wow, along with smelling nothing, i am hearing nothing. well, that's not true - aside from the clicking of the keyboard i am hearing something similiar to silence. even though it's not silence - there are faint sounds of insects shirping and doing their things, but it's close to silence. or is it? i don't think i've ever heard, or experienced silence. you can't hear silence can you? if a tree falls and no ones around to hear it, does it make a sound? how the hell am i supposed to know?! i would like to sit down and have a little chat with god one of these days. maybe i should go to church more often. well, maybe i should go to church period. but i've been before and it never answered my questions. it just made me wake up earlier. i used to be scared of church. i think i was 10 years old and questioning my existence - is that healthy? i know it made me different. wow, i am an interesting person. i'm so suprised that i've typed to this extent. i hope all goes well and i get credit. i really like this psychology stuff. 500 people in a class - that's crazy. and i know no one. i will meet people. i can't imagine standing and talking in front of 500 people for an hour and a half. jesus. i don't know if i could stand up for an hour and a half let alone talk that long. 20 seconds. that's all i have. well, god bless america. god speed.

"it's sunday and i need to go to church since i didn't go this morning because i woke up at 11:15 and church is at 11:30. so i already took a shower and i'm dressed to go at 8:00 p. m. right now it's 7:25 and i wish it was about 4 because it seems like the day has just went by and i haven't done very much. that's alright though because i'm listening to my favorite rap music. trick daddy dollars, ja rule, dmx, ice cube, hot boys, juvenile, black & dangerous, k-roc, too short, twista, and jt money they seem to make me feel better. even if i'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. she got mad because i was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where i was at. so i had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. i was mad also because i gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. so we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that i didn't approve of. so i was instantly angered because i have a short temper to begin with. it was a big deal really but i don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. so we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. she decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. i acted like i didn't care so we just ended it there. this worries me because i hate to end it like that but i'm so hardheaded that i won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. it also hard because i'm here and she's 355 miles away and i can't see her the way i use to. i guess i'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what i'm use to. the girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people i've never seen so many people in one place at one time. being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that i'm not used to. hopefully i'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. i don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. whatever happens i'll just try to do my best and do the best i can as things come along.

"well i'm sitting here wondering why i have to do this assignment. should i type correctly, capitalizing words. i don't normally when i chat on i'm or email someone. i really wonder if i'm ever going to get that song i'm practicing on the guitar. it's so hard to hear the parts because there are so many other instruments, namely the piano which is really getting in the way. maybe i should try something simpler. but i get so bored with the simple stuff. i wonder if i can eventually get a jason mraz song or get to the point where i can just play something cool and everyone recognizes it. will i ever lead worship at a church? who knows. i don't really think that's my thing. there are so many cool people that do that already. in fact, i loved friday night worship at the sanchez building. i really want to go back. i don't know if hope in the city is the church that the lord wants me at, but i really like it. i love how everyone is so friendly and genuine -- the worship is passionate, and i love that. i walk in and go, this is how christians should be. """" not like the majority of churches you walk into and see all the little cliques of friends, most of which are too comfortable and exclusive to open up to a new type of person or just a person in general. however, i know that there are some really cool places in austin that i want to try: the austin stone, hyde park baptist. who knows. oh, ev free. oh, i saw court rode today. man i love that girl. i hate that it's sometimes a struggle to talk to her though. it's cool if we talk about the general stuff, but not normal enough to just say whatever or something stupid because we haven't spent much time together. i mean, she is really cool, but she is a senior and has her own stuff, and i doubt that she would ever just want to hang out with me. however, i should give myself some credit -- i mean, she has called me and invited me to places (church, a cook-out. ), so maybe she is interested in introducing me to some cool people. cool people -- i'm finding some but still missing steph and allison back home. man i love them, too. they're great. i miss being so comfortable with someone that you can just do or say whatever's on your mind. or if nothing, you don't have to say anything, and it's totally fine. i wonder how they're doing. i wonder how allison is doing in the dorm, meeting new people, finding new good friends, like amanda. i'm really excited that allison is branching out and exploring a&m, but i'm not ready for loss of contact completely, and i don't think she is either. i think she wants to (as do i and as does stephanie) """"make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the other gold. """" i can deal with being silver, or bronze even, but i would like to keep a place in her life. and man, i really want stephanie and i to stay the good friends that we've become this summer. after leslie's death. i love how she always understood and felt the same way i felt. we agreed that we never knew what al was thinking but that we wanted to. leslie -- man i miss her so much. silver taps at a&m is tonight, and i really want to drive back. i know i would miss spanish in the morning, but i just want to see my friends and talk about her and remember her. i feel like things would be so different if she were still here: stephanie and i would never have become as good of friends as we have because they would still be hanging out all the time. they would still support and love me completely, of course, but i think i would be more like allison -- really branching out and finding new people. plus, stephanie would have someone to chill with in college station. sarah is cool and all, but she has her own issues, and i really would like someone there to keep stephanie accountable, to pay her the attention that she needs. because we all do! i would really like to find someone like me, but not too much, and without a boyfriend (because the only cool girls i've found so far have boys. long-term boys, i think). i really want someone (a girl) that i can just play around with -- be stupid and say stupid things, but also have fun and be silly. i want to be able to plop down on her bed and either cry or laugh incredibly loud. amazing, i actually already have that. do i need'want new friends other than camp friends like megan and meredith. they love me so much and support me like crazy. they like it when i'm around and like to spend time with me and hear about things with me. especially meredith. megan has got lots of other stuff that's she is doing -- which is cool -- but she just doesn't really have all the time for me. which i guess sounds kinda selfish now that i've typed it out. but meredith -- truly loving and sincere and like a big sister. just seeing her around campus encourages me and makes me feel at ease. not that i'm so uncomfortable here. i am so glad that i left college station and a&m to come to austin and ut. what a blessing! this place is amazing and fun and new and exciting but also is quickly becoming a home. i find myself either almost getting lost or just finding new places or directions or whatever to go around town, and i love it. i love being able to know what street takes me somewhere else, or where my friends' houses are or where to go shop or. whatever else. friends' houses. the boys -- haven't talked to them, want to see them. the girls -- looooved going over to their house the other night. i got to chill with meg and tell her about school and life and etc while she shared the same. liz and i also got to talk about spirits and applications and all that jazz. oh and i made it to the second round of the texas spirits app! exciting. i can't decide what i think about it though. i know who i am, and i just want to be myself, but from what i hear and have seen, it might be like a sorority. blah. i just don't want to conform -- i want to be a part of something cool and unique but without being stereotyped as something. i don't know. cookie-cutter, i guess. i hate that. i want people to like me for who i am. stupid and crazy and silly and fun and smart and perfectionist that likes crazy things and crazy music. crazy music -- acl! and russ is coming into town, and i just don't know what i think about that. do i like him? does he like me? i have no idea. i don't think i'd ever date him. he is younger and in colle sta and whatnot. but he is pretty great. i just have no idea. ok well honestly i can't stop looking at the timer and how i have thirty seconds left. so i hope that i wasn't graded on capitalization or anything because i'm sure that i messed up all over, but hey it's all good -- all we had to do was write this thing. i'm confident. i'm happy. class is cool. don't want to take the tests ",0
"well my experience so far up in this large city has been one i won't forget. i've several new people but most of the people i am with are the one's that i have known all my life. it's amazing how much you can share with your roomate although i've known her all my life. i just feel bummed cause i'm so far from home i miss my parents and most of my family. and of course there are boy problems too. john who i have liked forever doesn't even give me the time of day. which totally bites. i just wish he would notice me and then there is my kind of boyfriend back home whom i need to let go but right now he is the only thing that is holding me up from completely losing it. it's scary up here. and being mexican really doesn't help either. i feel like an ugly duckling up here. i feel that people are looking at me different because i don't look like them. or maybe i'm just very parnoid about meeting new people. it's funny though, i have been waiting for this experience for most of my teenage years and now that it is here i just want to go home to the normal for me at least. it is just so frustrating when your sitting in a classroom of more than 600 people and you have no one to talk to. i know i should start meeting new people and all but it's just very scary for me and i don't even know why. i evy alot of people up here. i evy those that can just sit next to a person and be like hey my name is becky or whatever. that just one of my many problems. i know they are stupid but they really freak me out when i start to think about them. so most of the time i try to stay away from things like this that will make me think of all that is confusing in my life. what i do not know is if i can live here in austin and go to school here for 5 years. when i came to orientation at the business college they had posted in big letters welcome class of 2007 me and my roomate were like what we have to be here 5 years that is crazy. everyone that i left behind back home all told me that these were going to be the best years of my life. and that i was going to meet my life long friends. so far i truly believe that all of us from san benito will remain friends the rest of our lives. i guess you could say that we are each others shoulder to lean. we always go out together, eat together, and just hang out together. i know it is against school policy and all but before school started we had a big sleep over and everyone just hung and enjoyed each others company. i liked that alot. i think it brought us closer and we learned to appreciate that connection we had with one another. i just know they will be there when i break down and cry about everything that i have been building up inside my head. thank god i knew my roommate because my other girlfriend is having some difficulty with her roommate and i'm just fortunate not to have that problem. it's like diana and me our soulmates we just didn't realize it til now. it's funny cause we share the same thoughts about most stuff. and we even spend countless hours talking about boys and other things bothering us, but it is mostly boys! i love her a great deal and i am extremly grateful for her. i also have a friend back home who i used to work with and he is great too. he calls me and leaves me inspirational messages on my phone which always brings a smile to my face when i'm struggling to get to class in the blazing hot sun. but god blessed me with really great friends.

"well what do i want to say i guess i should start by being pissed off that the girl i'm dating didn't call me last night after she said she would. we aren't committed or anything it just aggravates me when someone goes back on their word. well my brother's in town for the first time to see me we went to a good party last night, actually it was totally lame and it sucked that it was his first u. t. party. tonight will be so much better though cause the party tonight will be cool. phi kappa psi is where it's at. right now notre dame is barely beating purdue even though it's a two point game n. d. should run away. college has been cool so far and i like the fact that i automatically get credit for this assignment by just writing my thought down. that's pretty cool. my hardest class is my calculus class it's totally reeming me. i've never had a tutor before but he's my new best friend now. damn it's hot in here. the cafeteria should open right about now. i hope they have good food today lately they've be lacking the good food department. my roomate just doesn't understand. i really do believe he and i are do a good fist fight before it's all over. actually it won't be a good fight because i'll kill him. he's so loud and thinks that just because we're roommates we're automatically buddies for life. i think we could be friends maybe even good friends if he could. we'll how i don't know cause he gets on my nerves so much. oh well we're two different people from two different background. kid rock is awesome. especially on the mtv video awards. it's really hard to writes and sing at the same time. but i guess i can do that considering the fact that there aren't any wrong answers and i can write anything. i don't really miss home that much. maybe my family a little but austin is so cool. i just hope i can keep my grades up so i can stay in the fraternity. and i hope i have enough money to pay for all the dues. well my time is almost up and i hungry as can be so i guess i'll go now. ?

"this is an interesting assignment to be doing. i don't like writing but this is different. i like being able to wrinte whatever pops into mw head and not worry about it being scrutinezed by an evil english teacher. twenty minutes is a long time to be writing though. i could be doing sometinhg like playing a game of starcraft or half life right now, or writintg some c code. i am going to implement a router advertisement program to take advantage that windows boxes are stupid and let me remotly rewrite thier routing rules. its nice of them to do this for me, but i'll do that later. i wonder if i should write it under windows or linux, or sine ither flavor of unix. i'll prob write it under windows if i gan get the neccesary access to the transport layer of the protocol stack just for that change of writing something usefull for windows. i actually have written some useful software for windows. most of it would easily cross compile to unix. a fun peice of code i wrote takes a string such as """"sin(x)^6-3**4-x^(e^x)"""" and evaluates it as a mathematical expression for a given value of x. if you've ever written code, this is not easy to do. i am listing to music right now. it helps stimulate the mind. :) i usually listen to music when programming. i am more productive that way. i am able to apporach problems and dig out the answer of some nasty place its hiding. 20 minutes sure is a long time when you would rather be doing something else. how many points do i get for doing this anyway. after i do thins i may go and eat or spend some time with melissa, my girlfriend, who also happens to be my fiance :) she's great. after that i can write my router advertisement program. that would be fun. i love melissa. being in austin is great. i like it much better that being in san antonio. i want there last weekend and wanted to be back up here the whole time. that could have been because all y stuff is up here. my parents miss me though. i sohuld call them. i;ll do that later. i have a lot of homework to do. lets see, i'll check the chem web site after this and see what problems i have to do. i have to do the other assignment for this class later, and read. i have 2 sections of math, and reading and some homework in double e, college of engineering is college. i am a computer engr. student. ee is probably my best calss this semester, but psych is next, math is boring because it is going too slow (don't tewll my prof i wrote that) and i just don't like chem, the highlight of the class is when dr white starts singing. he is a weird guy. only 7 minutes before i can hit submit. i like ut. its a fun place to be. i need to buy another compputer. i host a site that provides free domain and web hosting to whoever wants it, and the boxes i have right now are slower thatn anything. i also need to call network soulutions and beat the m up until they do their jobs. i am hot. my apartment complex needs to fix the air conditioning. that would be good. all my roomates are in san antonio for the weekend, but i stayed here. i should call my parents later. that would be nice. i love melissa. 5 minutes left. my attention span is shortening. i will write my router advertisement prog first because melissa is sleeping. i need to go to heb and buy some sprite. i havent had any in a could days. since shool has started i have gone through 6 12 packs. tonioght i am going to try this company called midnight taco's for dinner. they sound good and operate between 7pm and 3am. i hope the food is good. i want a job, but a good one like i had in san antonio. i would like to put some moniy into my bank acct rather than just withdrawing it. that would be good. i only have 2 more hours of experiments to do, it will be nice to finishe them. i love melissa 2 minutes left i am hitting the submint button at exactly 4:50 , even if i am in mid-sentance. i need to turn the music back on, it finished playing, htats better, i can't spell (thats is waht i meant) rage againsta the machine is on. 1 more minute. melissa is great. shool is good, it will get better once i get into my major sequence. time for me to go soon, i want that clock to say 4:50, the phone is ringing. bye ",0
"after spending almost an hour trying to get my computer at home to work on-line, i finally got here. so what do i say? well, i guess everybody says that the first time that they do this assignment. i guess all that is going through my head right now is the advancement of the classroom. i am actually fulfilling an assignment by typing on the internet. i think it is pretty cool, though i am a little worried about what the future has to offer. the future is probably a real uncertain thing for me. i do not know where i will be in ten years or even ten months from now. will college work out for me? will i change my major from advertising to design and back again or will i totally steer from the graphic arts which i so dearly love and take up a new love or hidden talent. well, i do not know. i guess that it is all the future really is to me, just a bunch of questions with unclear and vague answers. it is probably the same way for everyone else, at least i hope. what else do i want to type on my new fancy compaq laptop? i don't know? as i ponder this a song i heard today keeps coming out and no matter what i do i cannot get it out of my head. and as the case always is i can only remember a few lines, while i try to hum the rest. """"blue skies -- all of them gone -- nothing but blue skies from now on"""" and that is all i can remember. when i come to think of it i really never heard this song today or anything, it just popped into my head. it is from with honors, my most favorite movie of all time. i don't no whether it is the actors i like, the music, or the emphasis on walt whitman, one of my favorite poets, along with everybody else. everytime i take a pause the song starts coming into my head again. when i really listen to the words of the song it is talking about your future, pretty coincidental, i might add. it is almost scary! but that is what i am going to have in my future, nothing but """"blue skies"""". i think that that is too optimistic for my blood. i am usually the glass-is-half-empty-kind-of-guy. and i do not know -- darnit i hit that caps lock button for the millionth tiem again. i hat that when i am typing really fast and the ideas are flowing and then -wam- you hit the caps lock button or some other button that makes you take time and fix what is in caps or something else. to totally get off the subject or anything, but it is a really beautiful day out, today. if it wasn't so hot outside i probably would be outside right now, instead of in here typing this - whatever it is? speaking of being hot. it just me or does it just keep getting hotter as you walk all the way across campus for a class. well i guess it is better than rain. i always want the grass on the other side of the fence -- my mother says to me all the time. i informed her the other day that i was going to have a better life when i become rich and famous. as i soon found out that i shouldn't have brought up this subject to my mother, because she spouted for the millionth time that the """"grass is not always greener on the other side. """" i totally do not agree with that. i just told her that i want things to be better and that you always need to strive for the best and i think that there is nothing wrong with that. my hands are starting to hurt! i think i am going to stop. i feel sorry for the person who has to sit down and read this. well i bid you farewell. and may all your skies be blue!

"wow this page is not really what i was expecting. besides that ticking timer thing in the top is distracting me because i see it ticking. damn i tried to scroll down thinking i could move it out of my view to avoid distraction but it won't scroll. typing is annoying me. i can do it fairly well and fast without looking but i keep screwing up random letters and making typos and i'm tired of using backspace. well then. i just picked on my face and now it kinda hurts on my chin. i just looked and the timer and it already says 2 minutes. wow this is going faster than i thought. i actually thought i wouldn't mind this assignment too much because it seems kinda fun to just type whatever a persons thoughts are. plus its not a typical assignment. i love when assignments have time limits. my right arm hurts. its a bad setup for typing at my desk. all my computer and everything is diagonal so it can fit but its bad to type this way for long periods of time. i just had so much trouble typing the i"""" in periods for some reason. it was annoying me. wow 5 minutes. i keep having to adjust in my seat. not so comfortable and my legs are not feeling right. there's no good place to put them. and my underwear are riding into my ass. its really fucking annoying. ok i fixed it. well i thought so. ok i think that's better now. i just got a blank and for a second i was actually thinking about nothing. or it seemed to be nothing. is that even possible? i don't think it is. i think probably someone is always thinking about something. maybe they just don't know what it is consciously or something. there's people screaming in the hallway. someone wants to get into a room or something. man this is kinda frustrating because i keep feeling like i'm trying to actually say things worthwhile and then when i start talking about what i'm thinking about i think about other things in the middle of a word or something and it throws me off and just generally confuses me. well i still have about 10 minutes of useless babbling to do. my boyfriend is one of the things that keeps randomly popping into my head and when i'm about to type it, my ass hurts or there's people screaming in the hallway or something. so then i'm thinking about that. i like to think about my boyfriend. sometimes i actually do it on purpose. and then other times i'm trying to pay attention in class or something and it becomes a distraction. anyway i don't really know where i'm going with this. my roommate let me read hers (she just did this a minute ago) and mine sounds a lot like hers - its kinda freaky. i think there's holes in this stream of consciousness theory (that looks funny i don't think its spelled right. i didn't think something else up there looked right either but i don't remember what it was. ) the holes! i can't type as fast as i think and therefore i can't really keep up with what i'm actually thinking about. but its kinda clever anyway. there should be a way to actually hear peoples thoughts while they're thinking them or something like that. like ummm what women want. but actually i don't really want anyone to be able to hear my thoughts just for the sake of science. because that's assuming someone could hear them whenever they wanted to and that's just creepy. i'm sitting weird and its hurting my right leg. and now my left arm hurts. i adjusted earlier to try and solve the diagonal thing (aha! that's what was spelled wrong earlier. heheh. ) um someones knocking on our door. its weird. my roommate said come in and they went away. i don't know what's going on actually. rebeccas bitching because """"quiet time starts at ten. """" that's true though. maybe they had the wrong room or something. this is a hard assignment for me because i'm anal and i don't want to leave things unfinished and i keep doing that. i wanted to finish what i was saying earlier. ooo 19:36. the time draws near. this is kinda strangely fun actually i might do it sometime. probably not ",1
" i like the idea of doing class assignments over the www. it's much easier. i think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers. students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student. i wouldn't like that however. something would be lost without the direct personal lectures. a person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater impression on me than any computer text ever could. i feel like i'm sticking with this subject too long, i'm thinking with too much structure. but i think that is the way i am. before i communicate, whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone, i usually have a solid idea of what i'm going to say. i don't usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness. i hear someone whistling in the hall, he's probably an active who will make me clean some mess up. oh well. wow i reached the second line, i just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text; like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing. isn't that ironic. i have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling. but if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper, that would mean that what i'm thinking is just meaningless rambling. it's always like that. my mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation (this chair isn't too comfortable) at light speed. no matter how fast i write, i don't think i could ever capture the zany, random, chaotic, and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant. but if they become forgotten how do i know about them? i wonder what i'll do tonight. i'm not sure at all. it's one of those times when i could have fun doing anything. i might. i don't know. it doesn't even matter. i don't know what else to write. i'm at a loss. maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency. i just went from the imaginative (sort of) colorful thought chord (you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book), to a superficial lethargic tone. i feel like a cave man, the only thing my mind says right now is """"food. """" thank you. ",0
"does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? this whole electronic assignment is very new to me and i have no clue what i should do! i'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. as i'm typing, my fingers are shaking. the whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! college is a completely different world and i honestly don't know how well i will do! do i have to capitalize my i's ? i type much faster if i don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. this 20 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 7 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in ap language. mendrop made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely wrong! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think, what am i supposed to do now? i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ?

this is a really really cool assignment!! i think it'd be cool if i could jut talk to someone like this totally going off on tangents whenever i want to. speaking of tangents. i hate precalculus!!! i don't think i should take calculus in college cause my roommate( who i will get to later) says its really hard and he's quite the wiz at math. i'll take it at community college maybe,. yeah yeah yeah. ogh my roommate kareem. he's a friend of mine from houston. its like we've been together 24-7 since we moved in together and its really kinda annoying. i feel bad cause he was like one of my best friends and now its like i don't wanna be around him anymore!!. so i'll tell you what i want what i really really want. if you want my future forget my past. if you wanna get with me. better make it fast. spice girls suck!!! i'm listening to a new cd right now that i got at the radio station at ut---91. 7 kvrx. i'm applying for a position there as a dj or something. that should be thrilling. i just wanna be heard guys!!! if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends. if the song was called gotta get it would be cooler!!! this is gonna be like so long!!! i still have 11 minutes!! what am i gonna do!!! there was this girl in front of us in psych. today who my friend says is really stuck up and superficial so i kept whispering """"superficial"""" to see if she'd turn around. she never did. so does this mean she's not superficial or she is. she just doesn't know it. as often is the case. i think this paper rocks man!! i bet ya'll get some really freaky ones like the end of the world is coming to austin!!!! the mtv video music awards is on in 2 hours1! what if i get like caught in the net and i cant watch the awards!?!?! that would suck!!! i'm going home in 2 weeks~~~ my friend is having a bisexual encounter tonite ~~that's pretty weird huh?? i don't really understand the concept of bisexuality~~ isn't it either on or the other?? well i think of myself as bisexual. and hey now you cant go printing this all around the class cause i haven't really told. well anyone except like 3 people. but its so weird~~~~so so so weird~~i could be a lab rat couldn't i??? i m not a rat!! i wanna be a guinea pig. all my gay friends say they don't believe in bisexuality. to each his own i guess. i have a lot of gay friends case i worked t the gap this summer~~~that was actually like the coolest job i've had thus far in my illustrious career in the working world. 5 minutes to go!!! yay!!! how in the hell are y'all gonna read all this!!!! my roommate just came home. what a dork. he's in the bathroom rite now. i told him he cant be in here cause he's interrupting me but it's really cause i don't want him to see what i wrote!!! uh oh . phone call. i'm talking on the phone call. on the phone call??

" thank god the day is almost over. today was the draw for tickets to the ou game. it was an incredibly hectic day because all of the pledges of my fraternity had to wake up early to get to the stadium so we could draw tickets for all of the actives. not to mention all the walking we had to do which was especially painful for me because i slice off a huge piece of skin off the back of my heel so it hurts every step i take. lacrosse practice is also tonight and the gash on my heel is going to be extremly painful tonight when he have to run. i am also still sore from tuesday's lacrosse practice. i am glad that i finally sat down to complete this assignment because i have been putting it off all week. tomorrow i am going to houston to visit my parents. i am extremely excited to be going back to houston especially since we have a new dog. my parents got a weiner dog puppy. it has short hair on its body and hairy ears, i cannot wait to play with it. all i can think about is how i have been running around all day today and even last night. my pledge brothers and i had to go around to other dorms and knock on random people's doors asking them for their ut id's so we could use their sports packages to draw tickets for our fraternity. i am also pledge class president and have realized that it is going to consist of me doing alot of crap. the pledge trainer talked to me today and talked to me about my responsibilities and i have a feeling that some of my pledge brothers might let me down. i went to bed at 3 this morning and woke up at 630, i am so tired, i just wish i could go to sleep right now, but i can't because i have to go to a mandatory ba 101 lecture in an hour. i am also going home this weekend so that i can have my parents do my laundry because i know that they will do a much better job than i would. i am also going to see some of my friends in houston who are now seniors in high school, including my old girlfriend and a couple of other pretty girls. i haven't seen them in a while and it should be a good time. my suitemate's cell phone just rang and i imagine that it is the fraternity calling him. he is my pledge brother but he is kind of annoying, we just let him as to pad the numbers since we were a few pledges short. my leg muscles are still aching from lacrosse practice and my heel injury is haunting me. i am going to be late to practice because i have my ba101 lecture til 630 and practice begins at 6, which is good because that means i will not have to run the compound, which is a lap around the fenceline of the intramural field complex, it is one hell of a run. since i have been here i have not really watched much television so i am falling behind on my favorite sports teams, especially the astros. the texans won their first game last weekend and it was one hell of a game. me and my buddy ordered wings and that was the start of our ritual for texans games. my roomate just walked in and wanted to know if i wanted to go swimming but the towers pool is disgusting and i will never go swimming there. two girls just came to the door to get their ids which i had to use to draw tickets for the ou game. i had to throw on a shirt because i was half naked and they were gone when i came back, but oh well. one of the girls who came by is my date to the ou game. ou weekend is going to be extremely fun, it will basically consists of getting trashed several nights in a row and watching the horns kick ou's ass. our fraternity rented a charter bus and it is going to be a good time. i am about to get dressed and ready for lacrosse practice so that right after my lecture i can catch the bus to the field. the bus i have to catch is the if bus and i have no idea where it picks up so hopefully i will be able to make it to the field at a decent time. if not, i would be perfectly content going back to towers and sleeping. but i have calculus homework that is due at 3 am so later i have to have my buddy help me out because i do not understand somne of the work, i am a little over half way done but it should not take very much longer. my roomate is awfully weird, why the hell would he want to live in towers his sophomore year. it would be much cheaper to rent an apartment with some friends rather than live in towers and deprive me of the chance of making a good friend out of my roomate. he is just so boring and always is around, even when i bring girls home, it is freekin annoying. the problem with this assignment is that some of the thoughts i am tracking are thought about what i am going to write next which makes this seem artificial because i have to think about what i am thinking about. i have had 3 hours of sleep in the last 40 hours are so and i am damn tired, i need a freekin nap and i think i am about to hit the snooze button for 30 minutes ",0
"today my aunt caroline came up to visit me. she was on a trip out here for business meetings. she told me a bunch of stories about her life at ut when she went here 25 years ago. she told that she was almost raped by a serial rapist the police had been trying to catch for two years. he had been stalking her for weeks, and she never even knew. the only other person i knew who this had happened to is a friend of mine who had an abusive boyfriend who would rape her on a daily basis. she's finally doing a lot better, but still has kind of a loser boyfriend. guys are just weird that way. i've been going out with the same guy for close to two and a half years now, and it looks like we might get married! i'm really excited about that, we've had lots of plans about various things, but i don't know. we want a house and kids and that whole thing. today in art class, one lady had a quilt as her piece to express an emotion and it really brought me that sense of home. it was so pretty, it had a floral design, but also had these powder green and white solid pieces. it really made me feel at home and almost at my grandma's house. she's got a quilt her mother made, and it is about seventy years old. it was made from material of old clothes that no one fit into anymore. their family was so incredibly poor that they lived out in the countryside, and worked in the fields. my grandmother has told stories of her life, some gruesome and some amazing. she used to be the one to cut off the heads of the chickens they ate, and it was nothing to her just normal. other times she can remember riding through the country side on her horse where there are now huge freeways and shopping centers. i often wonder what it would be like living back then. she gave me a magazine clipping of how life was like as a teacher back then (she was a teacher, and i am going to be a teacher) and i'm am really glad that we are well on our way into the twenty first century! they used to not be able to be married, have children, they had to go to church every sunday, clean the classroom at least once a week on their hands and knees with a hand brush, and all these other gruesome things. the only thing i have to worry about are the guns and cuts that go on in the schools (maybe it would be better to go back to the old days, huh?) i want to be an art teacher, but i'm not sure how that will all work out. my major will allow me to be an artist but with an all-level teaching certificate on the side. so. i can either be a starving artist or a starving teacher! (both kind of sad) however, i don't really want to have to be out there working, i'm more of a homebody, and want to be the typical housewife. everyone i know thinks i'm crazy, but that has been my goal (perhaps """"dream"""" is too strong a word) ever since i can remember. i have also wanted five children since the time i was about eight years old. i actually come from a family of four children, so maybe the fifth i want is an unconscious way of somehow """"outdoing"""" my parents. that has often worried me because it's kind of what it sounds like, but i really don't feel that way. my parents were actually the ones who first brought it up, so i don't know.

"as i start my third semester at ut, i feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. first of all, i'm excited because this is probably the first semester that i feel truly comfortable with my life here. i am living with my sister which is so good for me. we get along really well and i really enjoy spending as much time with her as i can. also, my exboyfriend is at ut with me now. he is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. but fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. it enabled me to find out who i was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at ut. because of our time apart, i made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. so, this year, i not only have him with me, but i also have all the friends that i made last year so that i don't depend only on him. my best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. her boyfriend came to ut this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at ut meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. she spent most of her time in houston visiting him. as a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. although, i know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, i realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, i fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. she barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. but i try to hold this against her because i know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. but other than that, i'm really happy with my social situation right now. it is a really good thing that i have this support of all my friends at this time, because i realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. i am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. in the first week, i already am swamped. although i know myself well enough to know that i will definitely finish all my projects, somehow i still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters i will have to pull (especially when i think of the fact that i have 8:00 classes every day of the week!). and i would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that i will have to build because i know how expensive they get. but, i realize that with the huge load i have so far, working is almost impossible for me. if i could have my way though, i would work at a restaurant in town. i worked at pappasito's over the summer and i really loved waiting tables. i met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. i think the reason i loved it so much was definitely because of all the people i met. there were mostly guys that i worked with and they were all so friendly to me. we would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. i got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. it was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. it gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself.

"right now i am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend. my roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls. my computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups. speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it? is it with an ie of ei whatever i guess it really doesn't matter. i just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate. the delivery guy was chill, i like ups. my roommate just put on a dave matthews dvd so at least i'm listening to some pretty sweet music. i am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie. it looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good. i just looked to my right and noticed my bike which i have not ridden since i got to austin. its a hoffman condor, which is a pretty sweet bike, i guess i should use it a little more. me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in chicago, that was tight. you would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond. my roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now. its cool. i just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had. he goes to acc and has no friday classes. he then skipped monday because he didn't have his car. today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having. he just asked me """"travis where are we eating tonight. """" that kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. i love college. dave is now playing granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. i love this song. dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . ggggggggggoooooooooo. ut is turning out to be pretty sweet. i love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. my last school had 1200 students so i knew just about everyone i saw, its a little different here, but its all good. just looked at the timer and it looks like i got about 3 minutes left. is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay? anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. phsycology is very interesting i really liked the lie detector test. props to michael for tricking that thing the second time around. just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought? one minute left that's really all i'm thinking about right now. the class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. bye.

" im sitting in my room at the towers, and i have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. however i do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. and if i had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. yet i can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the towers has to be the food. the cooks here should go down in the guiness book of world records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. and everytime i go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. as i look around my room i can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. because he eats all of my food. i went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. i havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. this fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing i am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. but every once in a while i do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences i can say that tony, the guy with whom i share a room with, is a very nice person and i believe that we will get along very well. so far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. my other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. and campbell has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. yet the one guy that i am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate joey. its not that there is hostility between us its just that i try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time i get yet he just won't seem to respond. maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. because i know when i was in high school this new guy moved in from chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents. but the more time i spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. but the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk a whole lot. and i had to remind my mom that thats how people are in chicago, and just to give them time because they are really good people.

"i thought i was supposed to set a timer. so i set one, and now i don't think i need it. its actually getting on my nerves. am i supposed to use correct grammar? i'm not using it at all. i'm typing like i do when i talk to my friends online. i like this song on delilah. i love delilah. why don't others? she seems to always make me in a better mood. or is it because i like depressing music. i love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. actually, i think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. i think i cry a lot, but i'm not always depressed. i use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. do i really like him though? or am i just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner? he treats me so well. was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight? oh well, i'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. but it bothers me when people don't like me. i miss my best friend lauren. that song today really brought back memories. i love college! i'm pretty much caught up on my work and when i finish this, i'll be even closer to being caught up. there is a lot of reading u have to do in college. wow. i hope i don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. i'm just so use to typing like this! that's not good. i don't like this song right now i wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well i have bout 13 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. in fact, i think it's kind of interesting. what time is adam going to call? i wander if he is almost done with all his homework. i love my parents. i'm glad i talked to them tonight. i feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. i love all the people that are here. many people thought i wouldn't like all the people, but i actually do! i'm a big people person i guess. i don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in? i probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. oh well. at least i read a chapter of psychology today. i have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. i thought he was going to tell us when to read! i found out he didn't, and now i'm trying to catch up. i can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am i going to wear? i have no idea. maybe i can borrow something from sarah. do i dress up or not really? i wander if oscar is going to come or if daniel is. how much is it to get in? well i have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. i'm so glad i got seventy dollars back today. what am i going to do with it? i guess save it until i really need it. i think we need a lil more food in our room. i just don't feel like going to the store. lauren had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us! ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. this is awesome! i can type without looking at the keyboard! i've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. i wander how i am going to be creative with my lonestar application. i really really want to make the organization. if i don't i'll be so sad. oh my gosh! i love this song. sure i'll think about you now and then. haha. i was singing. we can do that right? because i was really singing it in my head. oh man. now i'm starting to feel stupid. oh well. i wander what other people wrote about. hmm. i wander if i'm doing this right? ok i'm tired of sitting up straight. i'm so full. i think i need to stop eating so much! but i really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when i say i don't like being so skinny? skinny people always get teased. i want to weigh at least 115, and since i have come to college i weigh 2 pounds more. 107. ok my time is almost up. yayyyy now all i have left to do is read and finish my application. oh man. i have to get my shot tomorrow!

"i can't stop sniffling. i don't even know if that's how you spell it. i'm so pissed off that i'm getting sick. i guess that's what happens when you live in a dorm. i better not get some crazy disease though. i probably won't. should i finish my homework? or should i just pass out. i would prefer to do that latter. my bio 211 class sucks a lot of balls. the professor i think is just trying to sound intimidating, and if that is the case, then she is doing a really good job at it. man, i really really want to be a doctor. i'm not as smart as everyone else. things don't just come to me. i have to work for it. this may, in the end, work in my favor, being that if i(and hopefully i will)succeed, i will feel all the more complacent. but that's just wishful thinking. i'm really going to stop with the caring about capitalization. when i type emails i never capitalize my i's--well i just did. but that's different. there was this guy i one knew that always made me feel stupid if i didn't spell things right. i know how to spell. and i believe he knew i knew how to spell, but i think he took some kind of pleasure in my feelings of inferiority. perhaps, i will always feel that way when i am around him. well it hasn't stopped for about 5 years now. who would have thought that we would end up at the same university. i mean i know it's not a big deal, being that ut is enormous and all, but he is not going to escape me--i wish i want him to escape me. but i don't. that's not good at all. what a jerk. i mean ok, well he is not really a jerk,"""" but i always feel like he is messing with my mind. maybe i'm just the one that's screwed up. i think i am. i'm really glad i didn't seem him today. i needed a break from all that. good break from it right? here i am in my """"stream of consciousness"""" talking about it. i don't know if i spelled that c word write either--but who the hell cares right? wow--i'm really glad it didn't push finish on me there. sometimes that happens. that would have really sucked because i have already spent 8 min and 47sec typing this. i kinda like typing. it makes me feel pretty cool. thank goodness i'm a fast typer. if i wasn't, things like this would really suck. (i'm trying not to say 'suck balls') --now i'm laughing. i don't know where i got that expression from. maybe it was my sister. yes, yes, i have a twin sister. ohhh ahhh. a twin? does she look like you? are ya'll identical? blah blah. yes yes and no. the end. if i spoke anymore about this and this is in some way published before the class, there would a better hint as to who the writer of this stream of consciousness is. it's alright. not that i mind. i miss my nephew. he is the cutest thing in the world. i miss when he would try to say """"bob the builder. """" what a cutie! he learned to say my boyfriend's name before he learned to say my own name--yeah i was a little upset at first, but it's really no big deal. i am glad he has a solid man-figure in his life. the boyfriend's a good role model and he obviously loves my nephew very much--oops just sneezed. wow and sorry the phone's ringing. i can't be mean and be like hey i'm typing this stream of consciousness thingy. ok that's over, and i just realized that the spelling of consciousness has been at the heading of this page the whole time. i am a genius. beautiful. well i was spelling it right--that's good. man, sometimes i start to think in spanish. that's cool isn't it. i kinda like that. i wish i could speak fluently though. it would make things a lot a lot easier. i really do want to go to spain. it's on my list of things to do in my life, along with help others, become a pediatrician, and give back. i love my major. i'm so glad i chose it. we had a great discussion today about poverty and things of that nature. i am definitely a democrat but that doesn't mean i'm some liberal. liberals get such a bad wrap--it's not true. you know what else gets a bad wrap? jester. jester really isn't that bad. to me, when people complain about jester, they just sound really really spoiled. i know that's judgmental but oh well. i love how it's really social. that's how i met one of my really good friends here. we were in our horrible community bath --no it's not really horrible-- and that's how we met. she is really cool, from out of state. time's almost up. adios amigo.

"well, my mother has just gone back to india ten minutes back, and frankly i am not all too sad about that, or not as yet atleast. all these days there were a lot of things i could not join in because i felt obliged to spend time with her and honestly i enjoyed myself. what made me most uncomfortable was the thought of what others would think. would i be able to be a part of a group? i have never really been one to mingle in a crowd. i suffer from what i call the """" wall paper syndrome"""". i feel like the audience to a television program where everyone is settled in their roles. i might have just been flung inside and there i am trying to fit in, wanting to fit in but getting so so intimidated! everyone here seems so confident of what they are doing and saying and whats worse is that they are probably doing the right things, though who decides what is right and wrong i am yet to discover. i come from a different culture and background. i have always excelled in academics but here i find myself doubting my ability. will i be able to cope with the new system? will i ever belong? there seems to be a yearning to be accepted and appreciated, that i am terrified that revealing my true self, which i am not too sure about, might mess up all my chances. every one seems to be better than me, be it in terms of making friends, getting adjusted or simply being themselves. i feel that every second person is laughing at me. i feel so lonely inn this huge university. this is the worse feeling to have, feeling alone in a crowd! they say that everyone feels the same way in the beginning. but do i believe that? obviously not! here i sit in rlm writing frantically about my nervous self and everyone around me is reading either their reference books or a newspaper, no matter what they do, they seem to be at peace with themselves. that is what i am hoping that sooner ar later (sooner if it were up to me) i will achieve. i came here to let my self lose. to undo the shackles that had bound me to a not too pleasant past when it came to self esteem. i want to be able to do that. i want to be able to be the person that lives in my dreams. again am i trying to be someone that i am not? i know that it is not in me to go up to a stranger and start of a conversation. i stop after """" austin is so hot""""! is it wrong? does that make me in any way lesser than the rest? rationally speaking obviously not. that is the kind of person i am. but everyone i seem to come across is so extroverted. i know that there is no such thing as right person or wrong person but feeling seem to surpass reason at this point. is it because i grew up with asister who was always popular because of her looks and her gift of the gab. who had all the night life i never had, and said i never wanted. is it because of the mother i had. always the center of attention because of her looks and her brilliance, because of her great achievements and ideals. i don't think it fair to push the buck on to someone else. i must learn to take responsibility for myself. it is so strange. i always wanted to come down here. it was the perfect picture. i was going to start afresh. this was going to be the birth of a new self. what happened? am i giving up all too soon? am i alone in feeling this way? will this small fish find her way in the large ocean? will someone notice the wallpaper? will i be able to come out of this a surer person? will i be able to find myself, for better or for for worse, in this continuous fight to find my place in this puzzle. (that is assuming that i have a place!) ",1
"i've spent my second day at the university of texas and i'm trying not to hate it. i feel lonely and depressed. i miss wesley, i miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when i first went to wesley i hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now i know what the other extreme feels like, i really miss it. i kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when i was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in boston. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people i know. i feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. i can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if i'll like them, because i don't see anyone who fits my idea of what """"friend"""" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with kate yesterday because i didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- i say that joking of course, but i guess i feel like i can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - i mean i know who she is and it's what i expect. i'm so glad she came here too - i don't know what i would do if i were totally alone down here. i think it's really a different experience for me because i've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here i don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. i didn't expect to miss wesley so much. i thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone i've seen is the sorority'frat type and i hate it! i never thought wesley was that diverse or funky, but i guess i've realized what i had all along. maybe i'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. i mean i know there are plenty of wendy wesley oh-so-perfect women at wesley who drive me up the wall, but i know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say? i just had an argument with my mom and i feel really guilty, i haven't seen her a lot lately and i was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how i should rrahhhh - i hate that. i told her that i was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me i can't do it, right when i'm in the middle of an assignment. i'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. i'm at acc where i worked this summer and i came here because 1-i have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 2- i thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like i still mattered to someone. now i just feel like hell. i think i want to cry, but i always feel so crappy when i do that - since i usually do it for some really stupid reason, like i feel like a jerk or something. god, i just feel like telling everyone to shove it today! what a way to start the semester! ok, i'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. i'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but i hope i can. i really want eric to go, but i'm not sure if i want to want him to go. i hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, i'm sick of getting hurt. i think i might just like him because he's there and i'm feeling so lonely right now. i don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal? i'm not sure. i keep going over this in my head - why can't i find the right one? not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that i really like' one that fits all the qualifications i want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. i'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, i can't fully concentrate on what i'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there.

"the past two weeks have been extremely stressful. there has been so much going on, it has been hard for me to keep up with school work. i have not found much time for me to go out and relax. although, i believe that the stress i have encountered is being relieved. as the school year progresses i think i will be able to juggle school, work and my friends. i have been getting a lot sleep. even though i get plenty of sleep i still wake up in the mornings feeling tired and worn out. i don't know why, but i think i might be because i have been getting too much sleep! i think that is one of the main reasons i haven't been keeping up with my school work. this might also be the reason why i am stressed out. i have been so busy trying to catch up with the reading in philosophy. i went through provisional so i did not really get a summer vacation. so i want to slack off, but i know i cant. i do believe as time progresses i will be less stressed.

"being at cllege is a new experience for me and i think that it is giving me a sence of being dependant on myself. i like all the new freedom that i have gotten, but i also am homesick a lot. i miss my parents and being in my house in houston. there isn't anyone to make sure that i do everything that i am supposed to do. i am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that i am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, i am getting worried and that is gettting me scared. i have a lot of thing s that i need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. it makes me very frustrated and annoyed at the same time. i feel like i should be a lot more organized and up to date with everything. i am a very organized person, even a """"neat feak,"""" and that is why it's driving me crazy when i am behind. i think that if i work hard, then i will do alright. last weekend, i went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so good to be home. i was able to go driving around and i knew where everything was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that i just need time to settle into ut, and then i will be in more control. austin is never going to be """"home"""" for me, but it will be a place that i can come to enjoy. i don't think that any city can compare to houston because that is where i grew up and that's also where i have all of my family and friends. sometimes i think about how life would be like if i was adopted or even if one or both of my parents were dead. i look back and don't think that i could manage. my parents play a very important role in my life and i don't think that i would be the same person that i am without them. i know a lot of people that have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough times and they are doing well now, and i give them so much strenght and poer for being able to do that. if my mother would pass on, i think that i would really go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that i would become very quiet when usually i am very outgoing and lively. many things don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. i usually don't cry in movies, and i don't care to become very emotional all the time. i have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. no matter how depressing the news, i am unable to show my emotions. that is something that i think that i get from my parents, specifically my mother. i think that i have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical qualities from my father. i think that i am able to be the person that i am because of my parents. they helped shape me into the person that i am. there are friends that i have been close to in high school, and ever since i have come to ut, i have not been as close to. i don't know the reason for the change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have not tried as hard to keep in touch. i have heard that things like this happen and that you make all of your really good friends in college. i know what people say, but i have a really good friend at trinity and me and her have keep in touch really well. i think that she is an exception to the """"rule.

"i really don't know what to type. i wonder what this keyboard is made of. i really hate it when i type and i have to keep on pressing the backspace. the air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it's really cold. my neck hurts. what the heck is that on the ceiling. was it there before? i remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck. is that how you would spell spit-wads? there's so many words that i'm not quite sure how to spell. i remember i used to hate spelling tests in elementary. wow, i couldn't believe that i sat next to someone today in my calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class! i hadn't seen him in forever. i must say it really freaked me out. it was hot today. the walk to the business school killed me. on the one hand i love that i live in kinsolving. great food. nice people. close to the drag. plus a whole lot of my classes are near kinsolving. when did lisa leave? it must have been around 12. i wonder when she is getting back. i'm excited to go home tomorrow. even if it is just for a few hours. i left so much stuff there! i mean, i would have my mom just send it to me, but if i give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room, there's no telling how long she would search, and definitely no telling what she would find. that's not to say that there's anything significant that would get me into any trouble. but i know that there's old notes from junior high. crazy pictures from those crazy party nights. and who knows what all else. man, that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason. i definitely hate timed tests. such as the sat's. for starters i hate the fact that it's a standardized test. secondly, i hate that it's timed. and above all else i hate the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores. now i know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants. however, some people are just not good test takers. me! in school i can study, understand, and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes. but going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous. see, look at me. when i start talking about tests and intelligence scores i try to make coherent sentences; in other words i try to make myself seem intelligent. enough of that. what else am i thinking about. i can't believe that i am actually in college. it sounds so clich', but i can remember just yesterday when i was in elementary school. how my biggest concern was who i was going to play with after school. or what time recess was. it was great being a kid. that's not to say that i don't enjoy the freedom that i have now, but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility. i have my mom on my mind and i think that's what made me type that sentence. i just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what i was thinking at that moment. i would think of something and then type it. now my hands seems to just be flowing, my fingers just seem to be hitting keys. that's weird to me for some reason. well i only have a couple of minutes left. to me, 20 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts, i figured i wouldn't be able to do it. but here i am. this chair is so uncomfortable. it's so hard and so wooden. at least it's not a big, soft chair because i would never get anything done. i would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read. reading. something that is my downfall. i do love to read, but making sure that i have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story. ouch. something just bit me and i'm a little curious to know what it was. probably an ant. ,isn't that gross! we have ants in our dorm room!

"i really miss my home town, but only because i'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. i'm constantly worrying that i'll fail and i seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes i feel they are a bad influence on me. i'm only happy when i'm doing something, and people tell me it's because i don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time i don't care. i have a hard time concentrating, sometimes i wonder if i have add. i probably don't , but i like to think i do. they call that a hypochondriac right? i have a question: does believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? i hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems.

"wow i just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit i'm so glad i'm listening to this cd it reminds me of chris, who i miss terribly at the moment. i wonder why he didn't call me back last night well i guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. i think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though i have on socks and my slippers i guess it's just that i always get really cold in hardin house i don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. i like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and i think that's going to be a lot of fun, except i don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. i get really claustrophobic, especially when i feel like i can't breathe, kind of like when i go to sleep and i like to pull the covers up over me but i always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, i think it'll be fun but i'm not sure if i'm going to get in the whole way. i've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, i kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but i still really want to go in just for a minute to say i've done it. but leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and i don't know i'm worried because mark is a fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there i wonder why he's been telling his friends about me i really don't like that because i really don't like him and i know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that """"hmmmmmm. interesting. """" like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything i say, like i sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. i don't know i just really don't like that at all. and i think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. i think it's really funny that i've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but i just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. i still get them mixed up because i know i used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now i don't know which way is right because i can never remember if i ever actually fixed it or not. i think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. i don't know what i think about will. he's also a fiji, so if i go to foam i get to see him but i also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. i got sick of the hyphens. anyways, i think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like i'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, i'm sick of this song and i'm changing it this one is happier but back to will i just don't know what i think of him. or that. whatever. i am leaving cause i love you, i am leaving cause i don't and i'm hoping you will follow and i'm praying that you won't let me go. i want to know who sings this song, chris never told me. i still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, i really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. i miss bo. i could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like travis, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing i'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. i don't know. scratch my neck. anyways i never really knew about that but i've always liked him, 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party, i can't believe he didn't remember that at all and i thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. i love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and chris both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and i liked chris and they were fighting over me. i wonder if it was right that i brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun i can't believe i actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and i'm glad chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though i know bo really wanted him to, i'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because i would have felt bad but i didn't want him to do that around me i hate smoking so much i hope andrew quits it'll kill him i think it's so funny that leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the fiji island party, i'm glad i wasn't there because i think i would have been really embarrassed. i guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but i like not drinking, and i like feeling like i don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow i only have like 3 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but i sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song i really do love this cd i wonder if michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd, i really would love that. or maybe if chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it i loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? i don't remember. ha-ha hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but kevin's married now. i don't like how i just sounded like a bimbo there i really am smart i promise. i feel really stupid in my world lit class though because i've never taken latin and i haven't studied greek, and i don't know i just feel like i'm behind the ball here on dante's inferno. i like the book a lot but i'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression i don't want raffa to think i'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though i guess i just have to learn when to speak up, it's like i'm wow that just interrupted me and i had no idea where i was going. . i guess i just get writing and i have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. i guess that's what i have to do when i start writing a paper because instinctively i start editing myself before i even begin and then i just end up never really getting anywhere. well i'm done here. goodbye.

"ok, it's labor day. what a great day. good thing because i needed to do a lot of homework. geez, calculus is so easy but they give us too much homework. that baja place really sucked. that's not mexican food at all! it was way too expensive for the way it tasted. that dog commercial was funny! i have been eating too much domino's pizza lately. i'm going to lose all my muscle and just get fat if i keep it up. halo was awesome last night. 3 hours for one mission! that's crazy. but it was so much fun. that girl i met is so cool. she's different, and i like that. hmm, if i try too hard she won't like that and she'll get scared off. if i don't try at all she'll think i don't like her. girls are so freaking confusing. that chick had a guys name. mr. pennebaker is pretty cool and funny. i thought it was going to suck at first. oh my god that psychology book is starting to get really hard to read. the next chapter talks about all the parts of the brain and i don't think my brain will be able to remember all that stuff. i wonder if that puppy turns girls off? hmm oh well if they don't like it i don't care. i should get more water because its starting to run out. is weed really that bad? hmm, why do so many people do it? i don't know but i don't think it's that bad. alcohol is probably worst and that's legal. my hand is starting to hurt and it's only been like 6 minutes. i miss my car. it was so freaking fast. going 125 on the highway was freedom. now i'm really stressed out and don't know how to relieve it. i want to play halo again. i'm going to try to call her again in like an hour. i hope she isn't too busy. man i should just wait for her to call me, what if she starts hating me for trying too hard. i want to eat mcdonalds later on. and some ice-cream. damn, then i have to go run for an hour. why am i starting to hate that. it used to be my favorite thing to do. well probably because there are so many better things to do here. church was ok. the singing and piano were freaking awesome! it was a little boring though. mass in spanish is better for me. i have to go look for one soon. that'll be better. if god doesn't exist that would suck. that means when we die we just die. we can't dream anymore, we can't think, or do anything. we just don't exist. i can't even imagine that. because when i am sleeping i am still thinking. what would it feel like to no longer be in existence? well you wouldn't really feel anything. i'm answering a lot of my own questions. why does pennebaker want us to do this. he has his professional degree. he must be pretty damn smart. maybe he is studying us every time we go into his class. i miss my dog. i hope he is in doggy heaven now. i hate cats, why don't they like me. hey it's robert, i'm going to go answer the door. ok lets turn on the tv. only 8 minutes left. pp pp shee pp pp shee. he's busting a beat it sounds pretty good. i like coke better than pepsi. how can anybody not like adam sander. he is so funny and so is that guy on that god movie. what was it called. hmm. hmm. oh yeah bruce almighty. what was his name. ace ventura no that isn't it. hmm. oh yeah jim carrey. he is funny too. old but funny. wow will smith looks good for him being so old and all. i want to keep looking that young when i get old. music is awesome. i've learned so much about what i like since i've gotten here. i think i'm going to learn a lot about myself in this college. i'm glad i got accepted. actually i like that i got that full scholarship. man mad tv is funny. they are really good actors. i hope people don't think they are losers because it is really hard to keep a straight face and act so well. we are going to go eat again. yummy! i hope it is like a burger place or something. kinsolving food is pretty good. the people there are also really nice. that black guy is hilarious. he is really friendly too. i wonder when i have to take that test for the business school. i think i failed it the last time i took it. god she is so pretty. both of them. why are girls like that. why do they lead you on. even now she is leading me on. is the new girl my girlfriend now? we do everything that couples do. we go out in public together and everyone has seen us. does that make us an item? maybe. i'm not sure if i want a girlfriend here in college. but the companionship of a female is really good. having a good girlfriend is hard to find. i hope that girl i met last week will be good friends with me. i can learn so much from her. but she is too attractive and it'll be really hard for me to just be friends with her. i've already kissed her. she let me, so what does that mean? maybe just friends that think they are attractive. she probably did mean that she doesn't want a boyfriend. well girls are so confusing. 20 minutes up, time to go eat. later ",1
"i have never considered myself a good student. i never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once i got to college. now i find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. i wonder to myself, why? i am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now i am. i think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. i used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now i'm in austin, were there are many parties, but i am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until friday, and it's only sunday. i think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and i want to know why? i find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. the thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. i still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? i think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. or am i becoming a better person? because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, i have less time for the people that i love. so is this good for me, or bad for me? why do i study better when i am back home in temple, tx? is it because there are less distractions? in one hand there is austin, where there is so many distractions, like sixth street and parties. in the other hand there is temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. i have no idea why i study better when i am at home. i hope these are questions that i can answer after taking this course. i have never wanted any thing as bad as i want a 4. 0 this semester and i don't know why. this is good for me, but why the sudden change. for some weird reason i can not quit asking the question, why do i want to study so much? the key word is want. i do not feel that i have to study, but instead i feel that i want to study. this is such a leap from where i was only a few months ago. have i done myself harm by changing so rapidly? will this wear off after i get accustomed to being in college? i hope that it does not, because i like the fact that i want to study and do well in school. why did i not find this way of thinking in high school? if i had would it have made a difference? i am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but i would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. is there anyway that i could have caused this change if i had wanted to? i do not think so. the jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? after all it was us that did them. how can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? i tend to look back and wish to change things, but then i think to myself, that i was the one that made the decision in the first place. i don't know what causes me to look back so often, but i think that i reflect more often then others. is it because i was happier at the time that i am reflecting? i feel the same know as i always have, but i am a more serious person. i am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when i am going to school, i feel more uptight than usual now. i used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, i am only here for one reason, to do a good job. hopefully this will carry over to when i get a job and am supporting a family. i think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. i find it relieving to write as i just have for 20 minutes. actually i went over the time because it was so interesting that i was thinking in this way. i did not know that i had so many questions about myself, until i sat down and wrote about them. i found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. maybe after taking the psychology class i will be able to answer some of my own questions.

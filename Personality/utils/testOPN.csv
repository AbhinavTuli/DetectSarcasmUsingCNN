"i notice that my mind always wonders off to the things in my life that i wish were better. i tend to think about the differences between what i should be doing in my life right now, and what i am doing. i also find that one person in particular continues to pop into my head, a girl no less, one that i knew about a year ago, only for a brief period of time, but i miss her every day. i also have thoughts of longing to be back home, with my mom and my dogs. i miss high school. i built up a large list of friends over a span of twelve years, and now all of a sudden i'm starting from scratch again. like kindergarten in a way. i also feel the pressure of my mouting homework that continues to pile up, atop of which sits two gigantic architecture projects, both of which are do in a shorter amount of time then i am capable of finishing them in. life is getting harder. being a kid was so easy. i want to be a rock star. the path was set, my band was doing great, writing songs, about to cut our first albm, when college ripped us apart. nothing makes sense anymore. take me home.

"at this moment i,m really thinking about what i'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. i missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. i'm munching as i do this assignment, but i don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but i don;t know why. what is it with these computers anyway, i've been screwing with mine for three weeks and i can't figure it all out. i hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. no where can i find my freaking e-mail to check it. i don't even know if i really have an address because i registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. i figured out why food and computers don't mix. my fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. i like this assignment- i'm getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. i knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. now maybe i'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. it must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but i would probably have fun because i'm a camera hog anyway. i should have paid more attention in typing class. i know i'm not using the right ""home keys"" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. i hope i don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because i'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. i feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but i doubt that they are home and studying like i am. my mom didn't call back from work. she may not have even got the message thyat i called. mail takes way too long to get here from dallas. i thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. today's the eighth and i just now got stuff from tyhe second. tomorrow is jenna's birthday. i guess i'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. if i was her age zi don''t know if i would want a big sister. i guess it might be neat. i hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. i don't know what she does withall herw time. she always studies but she never gets anything done. i don't do much of anything, but i always getstuff done. i guess it's time management skills. i sleep too much. i think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?

"i am really tired right now. yesterday, nick (my roommate) and i went at 10:30 at night to gregory gym to lift. i really have to use the restroom right now, so i will be right back. sorry, i feel much better. my legs are so sore. i wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his'her body that he'she needs to use the restroom. this tv next to me is really big, and i would like to turn it on right now, but i have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. it would preoccupy me. i am really stressed out right now because i have so much going on. it gives me a headache. what causes headaches? psychology is going to be a really fun course. i type really slowly, and i am trying not to look at the keys, but i am not doing a good job. my teachers are all great, and i lucked out with my math professor. he actually talks english. i wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. it is an amazing thing. girls are wonderful they make so happy. i have to maintain at least a 3. 5 to stay in the business honors program, but i can do that if i really set my mind to it. joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. my bed looks really comfortable. i always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. deja vu is a feeling that i cannot explain. i have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. i think that i have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because i want everything to be so neat and clean. i wonder if other people have this same feeling. i am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because i don't want them to think that i am weird. who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? they must have been brilliant. i feel a little lightheaded right now because i put a dip of skoal wintergreen long cut in my lip. i hope that i can quit soon because i have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. my back is a little sore. i wish that i could go to sleep now, but i have to read some mis 310 stuff. psychology is a huge class. it has 540 people in it, and that is 50 more people than in my graduating class at spring high school last may. well, it has been 30 minutes. bye!

"so this assignment is sort of interesting. it's like your thoughts go faster than you think regardless of the speed at which you type. oh, my, that guy in my keyboarding class during my 9th grade year in high school, so sad, i remember he has special assignments because he couldn't handle writing a paragraph. the teacher was lucky if she could get a sentence out of him. what was her name? . i have no idea, i remember seeing her at the mall one day during junior year, and she recognized me. probably because i was one of the only kids who took her seriously. poor gal, it had to be hard to be ignored like that all of the time. at least she was really sweet, so people didn't have real hate for her. ah, the days at hutchinson. i can't' believe my roommate is in the longhorn band, actually the flags. i wonder if she will quit. she doesn't seem to have the time to devote to it. yesterday a returning flag member quit for those reasons. i wish she wasn't so irrational. the day she said she was going to quit, and she got that jar of candy so she stayed~! what is that? candy doesn't make you have time. let's be a little more mature here. get your lips ready? what. it's posted on her computer, i haven't quite figured her out yet, i don't know if i ever will. my friends seem to hate her from the stories i tell, and i'm not sure if i blame them. ah, roommate hell, who does not' experience it. at least we aren't fighting yet. and her stupid camera. i can't' believe she complains about not having money yet she spent 300 dollars on a digital camera. so now she has something else to take up her time, learning how to use it. so so so unproductive. i wonder if she wants to study for the chemistry test together. i hope not, i don't think she is even started the homework and it's due tonight at 11, oh, well i should stop worrying for her. i haven't looked at our fire escape plan, wonder if it's ever been used. i would imagine so with the kitchen downstairs and all, at least the building is only two stories, i guess i have a better chance of getting out this way, in case of a fire. my closet light is still on, and i want to turn it off a lot, but i shouldn't get up from the computer so i'll just keep thinking about it for the next 14 minutes, oh well, nothing i can do about it now. and on the closet light, i can't believe we had to have a sticky note up by the light switch for a week signifying which switch went to what. cristina couldn't manage to remember that the room light was the bottom one. i guess i am just critical of her lack of comprehension and common sense. i learned where the word common sense comes from while reading the psychology textbook. i bet if i thought about if for a second i'd remember what it was. i think it was an incorrect believe that involved the word commas. i'll look it up when i finish. i think it was in chapter one. i have managed to read so much for that class, but i'm still a little behind, only halfway through chapter four and i'm supposed to be done by 330 this afternoon, i really should read like three chapters of that this weekend, i find it fascinating and i want to read it, but my friends have been getting in the way of my studies. that's probably a bad sign. i need to get through to them that i am here to learn. having fun just comes naturally and doesn't require the effort that learning does. i agreed with pennebaker in the handout that you have the opportunity to be in two classes if you read the textbook, and i want to. it's like i built up the desire to learn over the summer from doing nothing, absolutely nothing. i really should have had a job. i made a total of like 200 dollars this whole summer, probably spent like 500 or more. i'm so bad about that. hopefully i will grow out of that habit through the years of college. i haven't even written a paper in probably almost four months. i hope when i take masterworks of lit i don't have too much analytical writing to do (false hope). sigh, candy. i really need to watch what i eat, this whole freshman fifteen will really scare a girl more than people would imagine. i am not going to let myself get all blubbidy. well it's the word that came to mind and that is what they asked for. i wonder if they analyze this crap. like how though. it would be like measuring how many times people say i, or say something negative. ha, i'd take the cake on that one. i should work on my negativity. but that's not something that can just be changed overnight. i should just slowly work on focusing on things more bright and enjoyable. if you focus on the negative for too long you become depressed and nothing makes you happy. and i'm a little prone to that being as homesick as i am. i just miss the people. my best friends, people who's opinions of me are solidly formed and won't change overnight. screw paul! my stupid friend i met here who's already decided he doesn't want to be around me after being full-fledged into our friendship he tells me i'm fake and intimidating. buck up pal. my other friends agreed with me though, i really haven't changed much, he just works me up in his head and then i'm just regular old me in person and he gets himself disappointed. i hope we don't have any, or many, awkward encounters. we shouldn't. he is all into his liberal arts stuff. and i'll never be in that area. i love engineering for that. i don't have to take many classes in stuff that i am not good at or interested in. i don't want to sit around and think about the world and do it in the way i was taught. but i don't want to be a snotty engineer who thinks that i'm better because i'm studying math. aaaaahhh, i hate college politics already. the engineering dean is really really overconfident in the school. i couldn't believe he told us we were better because our overall sat scores were better, duh they were better, the school doesn't have to accept anyone in the top 10 percent of their high school. and the rest of the university does! bah. i can't take that sort of unfounded confidence and bragging. and i think i'll encounter it in many of my peers over the next few years. that stupid closet light is driving me crazy. i want to turn it off so much and i only have to wait another three minutes. my roommate's aim is still on, i bet her cousin, boobs, is thinking i'm her and trying to tease her about enrique. i wonder if there are possibilities of this paper being deemed not stream of consciousness and me having to redo it. maybe. i bet they take a random sample and so some people get caught turning in crap, but others don't, and that guy that pasted the manual just happened to get randomly selected. i wonder if they do the 10 percent thing, simply ten percent of the population, oooooh yeah, i learned so much in statistics. except i don't think i'll ever remember the details. mrs. perez was such a sweetheart, i hope she is doing alright. i miss my high school, for some reason i don't want to type the name of it. so awkward not knowing who is going to read this. hopefully i won't be deemed a crazy . haha, along with the clingies, creepies, doodlers, boppers,. factoids save me. and i'm just about done, sad that i kept watching the clock the whole time.

"right now i'm feeling kind of stressed about school. economics especially. i'm really not enjoying that class. it is difficult and i haven't met anyone in the class i can ask for help. the only reason i'm taking this class is because i want to transfer to the business school. and if i don't like economics i'm wondering if all this work i'm doing is worth it. am i going to work really hard in economics all year, get into the business school and then realize i don't even like business? i sure hope not. the reason i chose business is because i like math and i like english but i don't want to major in just math or english and business seemed to be the right combination of both. i've also thought about opening my own gymnastics or cheerleading gym when i grow up and business would really help me do that. i just hope what i'm doing right now will pay off for something in the end. i'm also torn as to wether i want to try out for the diving team. i dove in high school part time and i thought i would give it a try in college. i really wanted to cheer for texas and i tried out but didn't make it so diving is the next best thing. i don't know though if i should concentrate on cheerleading and join an allstar squad and then tryout again next year or if i should give diving a shot to be involved with an organization at ut. i thought i was going to be happy with diving but now that school has started i'm not so sure anymore. i am really enjoying myself right now without diving. i have some free time, i'm not stressed cause i have a lot to do all the time like in high school but i wonder if diving will make me more stressed and i worry i won't have enough time to study and my grades will fall. it is really important to me to make good grades right now. i am worried i am going to get to my first test and not know anything. i feel like i'm studying right now and doing all my homework and so forth but i don't know if when it comes down to it if i'm really going to konw the information. i think i'm just nervous about taking a college test. i don't know what to expect and i think after my first test i wll be ok with everything. its just what i don't know is what makes me nervous.

"it seems weird that linda is in the same philosophy class as me since we both live in the same neighborhood back in houston, even though we have never really met each tother before. she says she is planning to bvisit houston quite often, but i don;t think i will as often as her. its not because i don't want to go home, but its partly that i feel independent here even though not monetarily. also, i would like to get the chance to vistit austin and get to know m y surrounding before going back to the norm and comfortableness of my true home; austin is my new temporary home. mike said he missed home the very first day; i don;t think i really miss home that much, maybe because of the contradictory or hyppocritical views i sometimes have of things in houston. i wonder if my schedule conflict involving ba101 will be settled with out further conflict; i can't afford to miss psychology atfor ba101 once a month, yet i cannot afford to lose sight of ba101. hopefully, this dan or brian character will be able to sufficinetly change my course schedule since tex won't allow me to do it any more. it seems that i got a lot to do today, yet at the moment it doens't seem as anything is concrete, expect some homework arbitrarily. its only been 5 minutes and its seems as though i have been typing at leat twice that long. i wonder how my mind will wonder to the next stream of unconsciousness. philosophy seems to be an interesting class even though the reading is quite strenuous. socrates must have been the master at breaking people's arguments; he would have been a great attorney or lawyer. which reminds me, what exactly is the difference between a lawyer and an attorney? perhaps its in how they represent people or their specific type or level of education concerning the law. the damn ethernet guy better at least give me a ring and try to help me fix the connection that was working until last thursday or so, i have called and left a message three times already and no response. does he live in dobie or just has a similar prefix to his phone #. once i get the ethernet working, i won't have to come here to this computer lab and worrying abut forgetting to tyupe in my if account #. almost all the peoplke i have talked ot about this labor day weekend have said they will be travelling back to home; most of my friends are those from my high school, we probably are at least 55 people representing cy falls. i would like to play a pick up game with gabe and see how much he has improved since the days he was with theh cypress falls basketball program. i bet jimmy is trying to get accustomed to his new surroundings at that junior college, which i can't recall the name to. mike's sister basically got the dusch from that jeff punk, i don';t think i would have confessed seeing another woman unless she was going to find out regardless; better from me than from a stranger. unlike the infamous zoi situation, only five more minutes until i can check my mail; hopefully, somebody that is not attending ut will have written me to see how everything is going or the panhellenic council will have finally decided to start their opening meeting. how many greeks, true greeks' hellenas , not fraternity or soririty people, are amognst me at ut. maybe i will meet some good looking girls. i knew it was candice as soon as i saw at the bic meeting; haven't seen her since the days at tghp. its weird that she knows amber, the girl i kind of hooked up with at one fo the turkeyballs in 95, so long ago. its alomsst time and i just read the click once to submit button while awaiting the time to log off this thing. only a few more minutes ; my wrist are beginning to sweat opn this uncomfortable keyboard. i keep wanting to type with my left ring finger because it feels liek it needs to be streched or so. time.

"so what do i think about for twenty minutes. i don't really know. it's different when you actually have to think about what you're thinking about. my feet are cold. which is so weird because my room is always hot! we really need to get that fan that we talked about. i wish i was home; i was always the right temperature at home. and if i wasn't i could just change it. oh well i'll be home at the end of this week. i hope steffie is feeling better and not having too hard of a time with classes. i haven't talked to nick since i've been gone; i wonder if he even misses me. probably not so much since he just started middle school and he is making all new friends. how come i haven't made all new friends? maybe i should have gone to a smaller college. i dunno, i just wish i wasn't here. seeing javi this weekend was great, but as much as i try to tell myself that i should be happy that i at least got to see him, i can't get rid of this hollow feeling. i think i've sighed in the past two and half weeks than i have in my entire life. but honestly, what will i tell mom and dad. i know that they support me but how am i going to say that after three weeks somewhere, i'm so unhappy and i just want to be somewhere else, preferably in oklahoma. i dunno, maybe i should just wait. it has only been three weeks, and you knew that you were a shy person. but eventually you'll start making friends like at home. i just wish i wasn't sad all the time. it makes me feel like i need to talk to dad about medicine again. i'm so sad. i hate it here. i just want to go back to normal. no matter what i do, like swimming the other day with jacob and alex. that was kinda cool, but i was still only mildly entertained. and as far as studying, i've always liked it, but now i depend on it way too much to keep me busy. oh yeah, i can't forget to go by the library today and ask for a job. if i don't get that done, it'll keep bothering me until i do. hopefully they'll have openings, because that would be the ideal place for me to work, i think. haha, everyone would laugh at me though. how perfect. christine, working in a library. whatever, it sounds cool to me. my birthday. i wonder if we're going to have time to celebrate it this weekend. i hope lee'or doesn't mind that i didn't call her. i should have called dee dee back so that i could wish lee'or good luck. oh well, she was getting married; i'm sure that she was so happy that she didn't even stop to think about it. i wonder what javi's doing right now. i 'm so glad he came this weekend. it was the best feeling. but then again, would it be worth it to change schools. i mean everyone is so pessimistic about this sort of stuff. should i even listen to them? i mean everyone said just break up before you leave. long distance doesn't work, but both javi and i ere so miserable. it caused more problems then staying together will. but i know what mom and dad would say. especially dad. he wants me to do well with business so badly. he is so proud. but i don't even want to do business! but then again, i dunno what exactly i want to do. except be with javi and start having some fun with this whole college"" experience that everyone raves about. so far, i'm a little disappointed. but i guess that's a little of my fault because all my motivation seems to have disappeared. except for good ol' school. at least i can judge that. i can't let them slip. my grades are what i can use to persuade my parents. that i at least tried the whole business thing, whatever. but now i'd rather do something interesting. ugh! business! yes, it's great. i got into ut business. wow! but if i can't even get excited about going to class, how am i going to get excited about getting up everyday of my life to do financial reports and stuff. oh blah! how boriiiinnngggg! how boring, how boring. but isn't that just perfect as well- i'm stuck between doing what i know is logically best and what i feel like doing. hmm, yeah, there are a lot of things on my mind. i always seemed a little stressed in high school. just trying to balance everything, but at least i had fun. i think if i were another person i probably wouldn't want to get to know me now either. despite the fact that i could get down before, i never doubted that overall, i was happy. now i just feel lonely. haha. maybe i should stop listening to coldplay. rush always said their music always makes someone sad. but i dunno, i really like the piano. and plus i have so many good memories from that one cd. i just need to listen to some more upbeat music i guess. maybe some ",0,-0.415659 0.206222 0.318115 0.125474 0.663285 -0.115228 -0.133131 -0.255198 -0.30518 1.007521 -0.216633 -0.268059 -1.031974 0.056285 -0.4307 0.0 -0.04277 0.373143 0.576391 -0.279984 0.53274 0.259346 -0.322499 -1.108615 0.537263 -1.675614 -0.544821 -0.480057 0.206389 0.255326 0.41901 0.052924 0.040387 -0.007436 -0.814309 1.325332 1.810275 0.579661 -0.257472 2.195334 0.189783 1.288343 0.402416 0.416048 -0.966708 1.512501 0.225763 -0.13869 0.659221 -0.088068 -0.984411 0.193318 0.322981 -0.116768 -0.478237 -1.280161 -1.152962 -0.496488 -0.894107 0.623876 -0.372037 1.006308 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 0.655901 -0.086094 0.563139 0.401784 -0.073676 1.562605 -0.210401 0.572345 -0.182624 -0.171161 0.953626 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.871411 5.002772 3.944287 5.145676 5.104826 4.570799
"well today i feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. like today i had to do this writing assignment to get it out of the way and do my math homework. by the way, i have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. anyways this weekend was pretty fun since i went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. i am a transfer student and i really miss austin community college (the college i went to last year). at acc you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the university of texas. today i have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on mondays. next week will be my first week to start work so i am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest i am going to get with school and work. it is my first job so i don't know how i am going to deal with it. well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time i don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally i am not a real psychology fan. i mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. i believe that god does everything for a reason so why question what god has done he knows everything. don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. for example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. another example is that i still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all i know. there are other terms that i am not to familiar with also and i hope i understand them better soon before the test. i really want to get good grades this semester so i don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the university of texas. i really don't know that many people here, but i have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to university life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. well i think that is about all i have to say today, hopefully i will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses.

"i'm sitting in a library waiting for my chemistry class to start and i just thought of a comment placed on the psychology bulletin board that referred to how people see light and if it is different from person to person. if you think about it, the only way we have to reference a color is by what we have been taught what it is. if i see green for what you see as red, how would we know the difference? this desk is sure filled with a lot of profanities, but not as much as the bathroom on my floor of jester west. oh, isn't it fun to live in a dorm, my roommate never sleeps, does homework, but he does eat, all the time, including my food from the fridge. the best part of the dorm was getting kicked out at 8 am so they could install a fire sprinkler system, this building is a lot older than me, why did they wait this long to put in sprinkler systems? did they do some sort of statistical analysis to determine it is about time for a fire, that it pretty scary. wow, i've only been typing for ten minutes, this is going to be pretty long. lets talk about something. like. well i don't know, hey, it sure was hot last week. i've lives in texas all my life, but that was still pretty hot, for september. i lived in san antonio and saw snow once in my life, that was when i was six or so and people say it sometimes snows in austin, i am starting to find that hard to believe. it's weird living in a smaller city, when i have to drive across town, you think this will take a hour, but it only takes about 20 minutes. the guy next to me keeps looking at me, it's starting to freak me out. i never knew i could put so many commas in a single sentence, the grammar checker in word in putting little squiggly green lines all across the screen, hey it kind of' looks like my rhetoric paper's first draft, and the second. i don't like that class, why oh why do we have to take it? well my 20 minutes it about up and i need to start heading to my chemistry class with a teacher that doesn't speak english very well, but it not hard to understand him, well at least i stay awake while tiring to decipher him.

"at the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how i will make it through college if i remain a procrastinator. thus, i am completing this assignment because i feel that i need to make changes in my study habits. moreover, i need to succeed at ut because i cannot afford to let my parents down. my parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if i fail in college. thus, failing is not possible. occasionally, i ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. at times, i feel, as though, i am a failure because i am constantly being compared to my older brother. everything that i do is not good enough and that i should be more like my brother; i guess one could say that i am always in my brother's shadow. moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. because they do this, i constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. in order to cope with this, i am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. each of these ""flings"" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. however, i am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because i know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. there is one thing good that has come of these experiences; i believe that i have found happiness with another. she makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who i am and not someone else. when i am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; i guess you can say she's my soul mate, but there is one thing i am sure of, i love her with all my heart. in fact, she has been the only girl i have actually told that i love her and actually meant it. just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile.

"life is so strange. for instance today i saw someone who lives right next to me that i haven't seen since i was in my hometown. i don't get guys at all. why is it that guys can act so uninterested and be so rude? it's strange because if a girl likes a guy she thinks about him and talks to her friends about him and can't wait to hear from him, but guys act like they could care less and don't even call you for acouple of days and don't think anything of it. why is that? when i have been talking to a guy and he doesn't call me it makes me feel unwanted and i tend to get pissed off. i miss my best friend in the whole world. he is at rice and my friend and i went and saw him last weekend but ever since i saw him i have been missing him more because i guess i remembered how much he ment to me. the whole thing with this guy i'vebeen talking to is that he doesn't act interesting and because of it he makes me question myself and has caused me to be homesick and yern for letters and calls from my parents and all of my friends from back home. it's strange how certain things trigger you to feel a certain way. i've been eating a lot of sweet stuff today and i've decided that once you've tasted something sweet you keep craving more until you're out of it or you leave the room. my roommate is nice, but she and i have a wierd relationship. we get along fine, but she isn't what i would call a good friend. that is one of the reasons i am never in my dorm room. why is it that people can be so mean to eachother? i don't like to be mean to other people especially if i don't know them but there are peole out there who will be maen and not even care about it. i also don't get why friends think they should lie to eachother. as a friend you're supposed to be there for someone no matter what, but if your friendis lying to you it makes it so much harder to forgive them once you find out. some of my closest friends did this to me and now because ofit i don't even associate with them. i don't understand why people feel theneed to drink all the time also. who says that in order to have a good time we must drink. i met this guy yesterday at dinner who asked my friend and i if we drank and continued to tell us how stupid it was because as children we have fun and do things just because, but as adults we must get dunkk in order to have a good time. i have never felt that i could justify drinking and i still don't. i have drank a few times but just as an experiment, not every weekend. it is crazy to me the number ofpeople who drink on a regualr basis. my friend at rice has been known to drink and that bothers me considerably because i don't want to seem him get addicted or get hurt. his father has a drinking problem and i worry that will have an effect on him. my friend cassie is so sweet we have just recently become good friends and we have so much fun together. she is one of those people who could care less what others thought so she just says ""hi"" to people on the street. that's one of the reasons i enjoy her so much is because she makes me feel like it's ok to just be nice and friendly to everyone and not worry whether or not htey think i'm crazy for doing it or not. my mother get's on my case about everything and nags me all the time. i know she's just trying to look after me and keep me safe, and it doesn't help that i'm an only child but, sometimes i can't handle all of her questions and concerns. i wish she'd just relax and let me live. don't get me wrong she's the greatest and i wouldn't change her for anything i just think it's time to start seperating what she thinks i should do and what i want to do. life is funny we go through it trying to make something of ourselve and live up to everyones standards when really we should just live up to our own and try and be happy and make some great friends along the way and hopefully help a fewpeople along the way. like yesterday i was walking and this guy in a wheelchair was trying to wheel himself up a hill and he was strugglinng. somone asked him for help and he accepted. more people in the world should just do little acts like that that help one person out so they don't have to struggle so much.

" i am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, i'm still going to think as i write this intro. you see, it's my birthday today, and so i could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. i'm taking a girl i like to a party tonight - i guess that might be more interesting. or maybe i should just talk about how my parents really piss me off. since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. but before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. they would bitch about anything, seriously. i mean, i had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. my friend jackson once told me i should get in a lot of trouble. then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. for some reason i never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. but, he was right. when they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year. okay, new topic. when i was over at my friend alex's house one day, this kid pulls out alex's . 22 rifle. i'm like, dude, don't point that at me, turn it away. he listens, and he starts pointing it at alex. alex is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. this kid is pointing the rifle at alex, making shooting noises, while alex is playing a nintendo game. for some reason, i had a really bad feeling. this was not a toy - it was a gun. pop! all of a sudden it went off. the thing was, the kid was at such close range, alex couldn't even feel the blast. i had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. i ran to call the ambulance, and i think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), i've never liked guns. my phone's ringing right now, but i'm not going to pick it up since i'm doing this assignment. you know, i bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. that's so boring. i like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. i'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. but thanks for listening and i'll catch you on the flip side.

"wow! time goes by fast. here i am doing my college homework and it seems as though just the other day i was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in college. time flies and friends come and go. i have met so many people since i have been at this enormous school. i have come to realize that you must take initiative in order to succeed. for instance, i am currently majoring in theatre, but i don't know if that's what i really want to do with my life. if i don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far i can go, i will never figure out if theatre is the way i want to go or not. then there's the question of what i'd do if i didn't major in theatre. i know that i wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time i've had to write this since i have had many computer troubles. i accidently erased the first one and my friend's computer froze when i was writing the other one. i am using my friend robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. right now i'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ut, and they're talking about ross's hair. some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he doesn't want his hair cut. they think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs to differ. anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. i just remembered that i have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my room. i hope it's not stale. maybe i can drink it with my over-do milk. it's past the drinking date. this gum is very stale and i am getting hungry. if i were in my room, i would eat my muffin or the chips that i didn't eat last week because i had to get to class. you see, i feed the birds my second sandwich because i'm full. then i still have chips left over. oh, well. the joys of wednesday sack lunches from towers. i'm used to sack lunches because i've eaten a sack lunch every day in high school. the reason is that we eat in the greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. some of my friends have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers get mad. ah, the good old days. robert and ross and kristi want to order a pizza. that sounds like a good idea. it's late and i have to get up early for my intro to media class tomorrow. college is a time when it seems hard to get any sleep. there's always something you've got to do, or just good old fashioned procrastination. i mean, i don't procrastinate. this isn't even due for another week or so, and here i am, already typing it for the 3rd time. adam sandler is on tv right now. i just learned that his cds have a parental advisory due to explicit content. isn't that interesting. funny how society tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these days. like my friends. they're crazy. children are exposed to so much, like from tv. i never had cable growing up, so i don't know what it's like. we did have channel 13, kera. that was nice. now, we're listening to the doors, which reminds of a midsummer night's dream because my high school did it in the 60's and that was the music we used. well, at least, we used some doors music. we used great 60s music. then i was in a midsummer night's dream in the 90s, and we used original music written by one of the cast members. he wrote the tune for the wiz, and tranfered the words because of course shakespeare didn't write like the music in the wiz. robert just called a guy because his number was on a dollar bill. he's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. then there's ross with his mushroom haircut and kelly, who some say looks like tom cruise, but in reality, he looks nothing like tom cruise. no more than the pizza guy, who looks like a clown. i am afraid of clowns and i haven't even seen ""it.

"ok, at this very moment, i'm am in pain, emotionally. yesterday, i had a bad experience. i saw my best friend kiss the girl that he knew that i had a certain attraction too. it really really hurt, but i have gotten over it. i can't really get mad at either one because first of all, we meet the girl at a club on saturday night' sunday morning and two, my friend is a little more wild and social so he was talking twice as much than i was. the girl called me herself last night, but i told her that i didn't want to talk to her anymore because i had lost interest in her. as for my friend, he told me that he was really really sorry, yet he hasn't come up to me yet to show his forgiveness. i'm ok with it, i just don't understand how something like this could happen. i'm in question though, i don't know if i should be mad or not? i think of one way, which is that i shouldn't let something stupid like this ruin a long, good friendship between my friend and i, or, if it was right to begin with that my friend kissed the girl that i liked after i had told him that i liked her. n e ways, good thing its all over and i'm moving once again with my life. i try not to let this things interfere with my everyday school life but at its impossible to keep them apart. for example, i could not concentrate all day yesterday because i was thinking of what had happened. i didn't read, i didn't do my homework, which is a very very bad thing. the good thing though is that i got over it and i'm back to normal. i guess its just one of those weird once in a while incidences. today has been a much more productive day then yesterday. i went to go see what color band i would get for the ticket raffle of the texas vs. ou game. unfortunately, i got the pink band, which is the least likely to have a chance to get a ticket. no worries, i wasn't really planning to go to that game, i just went to get the band because two of my friends asked me to go get it. i have a glow in the dark stars type of theme here in my room. i had never had the chance to have some in high school, so i finally did in college, and i just noticed that one of the very big stars fell off and is on the floor. i am looking at it this very moment, wondering why i'm not getting up and putting it back in its place. i also have the glow in the dark feet. my roommates, who are like really cool back from home friends say i'm a dork for having the stars, but none the less, i could careless on what they have to say because i think they are dorks too, haha. i see some dirty cloth on the floor and in that pile of clothes is my work shirt with i just happened to remember that i need to wash because i'm going to work tomorrow. dang that a nice car, i just saw a blue bmw pass by, very very nice car. tonight, my roommates and i are finally going to go shopping for groceries. its been a while since we have gone to buy food. another thing i just remembered is that i need to clean the kitchen, its my week and i have to clean the pig sty (kitchen). i got a ticket to go to the texas vs. arkansas game and i hadn't realized that it was this weekend. my roommates and i were going to go home this weekend, but i can't go anymore. they are still going, but i'm not. i'm kinda sad because i wanted to go see my little nephew and stuff, but there is nothing i can do about it now; i'm stuck here in austin. i told my mom about the situation and she got kinda sad, but i told her that it'll mean more the next time i go down. typical hispanic mom, she told me that i should of not made any other plans if i knew that i was going home, but that was the catch, that i didn't' know that the game was the same day that i was going to go back home. so what is going to happen is that i'm not going to go home after all and i'm going to the game with my friends. i just remembered that i was going to ask one of the ta's where sea is, but guess i'll just have to figure that out on my own. n e ways, my 20 minutes are almost up, after this i'm going to hit the sack and take my usual 1:30 nap and wake up, clean the kitchen and go buy food. c-ya ",0,-1.644731 0.452489 0.169116 0.150209 0.048571 -0.497221 -1.205268 -0.918905 -1.149082 0.795468 -0.053019 -0.248869 -1.054448 0.469483 -0.991705 0.0 -0.04277 0.217548 0.556201 -0.430009 0.471037 -0.564815 -0.021849 0.299686 0.199314 0.685152 -0.005645 0.289474 -0.649286 -0.784893 -0.292381 -0.904883 -0.072178 -0.587479 -0.368218 0.041447 -0.501798 0.157499 -0.34276 -0.313825 -0.603223 -0.677096 0.371645 0.341928 0.539317 1.097267 -0.859652 0.319225 0.9811 -0.532242 -0.57579 -0.395522 2.05296 -0.967623 -1.375514 -0.321775 0.560712 0.019404 0.141693 0.508522 2.728922 -0.214169 -0.480161 -0.118255 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.798678 1.176939 0.037983 0.402659 -0.396495 -0.37208 -0.172817 -0.422267 0.370531 0.246414 0.00362 0.021155 4.738284 4.087942 4.59531 4.591189 4.38914
"ok. stream of. ""come as you are. i wonder if anybody actually misses kurt cobain. ""no i don't have a gun""? what? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named nirvana, whose leader shot himself. blues traveler, much better group. i wonder how many people have killed themselves because of kurt cobains death. that takes intelligence. kurt's dead, life's not worth living. why did i wait till the day before this is due to type it. ohhhhhh i love this song. it reminds me of my boyfriend and i. ""when she says she loves me"". except i don't say i love him because according to every one of my friends i'm afraid to tell him i love him. something about a fear of commitment and love. i guess it's all supposed to be nathan's fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. "" when she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love"". good song. i wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. oh yah, classic sting. i have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. i never really liked sting anyway. i should really be doing my other homework. what do i have to do? english paper, read my classic civilization, read my english, study psy notes, and phl notes. i guess i can do most of it tomorrow. third eye blind. where do they get names for these groups? tomorrow is another day{go scarlett}. i really don't want to go to work tomorrow. at least i have a decent boss for once, not some 57 year old pervert. what time is it? wow 15 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. i wish they were all that easy. yah right. that probably wouldn't get me into med school. medical school, four more years of college. hopefully i can get through these first four. i can do it, because i'm good enough i'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. well it's been a great 14 min. i'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. i need to do these more than a day before their due next time.

my dad and i are trying to reconnect our computer and get the internet back on it and he is driving me crazy. he insults my intelligence and thinks i never know what i am talking about. this really makes me upset and hurts my feelings to the point i just feel like breaking down into tears. i am also stressed out about school this semester. i am on probation right now because my gpa fell below 2. 0. i am really trying to keep up this semester and bring it up but it is really stressing me out. sometimes i just feel like giving up on everything but i know that will not solve anything. my life just feels so empty right now. to start off with i get in a bad car accident a few months before i graduate high school and then get a really crappy job for the summer. then i end up on probation at the end of my first year at ut and i still have the same crappy job for the summer. then i also have to take a summer course at acc along with my crappy job. then i have to have surgery which put me out of commission for half of the summer. the next thing i know my boyfriend and i are separating after a year and a half. now i am back at ut struggling to keep up and improve my grades. my life just seems to be going down the drain right now and i seem to be following close behind. though i enjoy my classes this semester i feel i am going to fall behind and i will end up need major help to get through it all. i just wish i had enough motivation to follow through with my studies and just blow everyone out of the water with my grades this semester. i wish now that i hadn't put this assignment off so long because now i have to be all the way out here on campus instead of at home studying. you know if i don't get off probation i am afraid my parents or the school will take me out and i will end up at acc permanently. getting a degree from acc is not the best thing in the world you know. it is almost like getting a ged from high school because you had to go to atlas or something to that effect. ,1,-0.796467 -0.316955 0.134608 -0.427698 -0.931383 -0.017624 0.093089 0.515281 0.120355 -0.976684 -0.087145 -0.590446 0.016725 1.118585 -0.090188 0.0 -0.04277 -0.066923 0.720477 -0.406171 0.65078 0.392424 -1.142221 -0.59693 -0.624052 0.674231 2.639104 -0.018757 -0.203009 -1.492748 -0.52654 -0.310264 1.350515 1.80856 0.827683 0.729409 -0.682118 -0.32593 -0.079405 -1.303844 -1.038726 -0.126009 -0.866997 -0.862656 -1.429535 -1.110023 1.397368 -1.197198 -0.765361 -0.840184 -1.34699 2.103941 -1.784867 -0.033886 0.722597 4.350464 4.035365 5.26867 1.661265 -0.219547 1.257216 0.860456 -0.480161 -0.745201 1.445915 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.525804 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.384374 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.726265 4.605487 4.482792 4.416237 4.672257 4.019372
" i really don't know what i am thinking at this moment. i am in a state of emotional turmoil at the moment. i can't believe they cancelled farscape. i see no logical reason why that was necessary. i mean, the show had decent ratings and scifi had already agreed to pick it up for another season. it has to be something that doesn't concern the show. if i were paranoid i would say it was a big government conspiracy to see how people react to great emotional turmoil. i can't believe this is happening. there is no reason for it. it can't be financial difficulties. farscape is the highest rated series on the scifi channel. this is completely unbelievable. this is a major flaw on their part. they cannot possibly be sane or sober. maybe all of the executives are are currrently in the process of overdosing on crack, coccaine, heroine, and ecstasy. they have to be mad. there is no other logical explanation for this. it is freaking stupid. complete idiocy. this only further proves that the scifi channel and usa networks is truly run by a bunch of apes who have no grasp on reality. this sucks. they might need to be tortured to see the error of their ways. all of them. i wonder if the police are goign to get a hold of me for writting some of this. oh well, at thist point i really couldn't care. i really have no idea why i decided tto write this now, i guess i j ust needed a distraction from my own thoughts on this tragedy, at least a tragedy in my mind. damn, this is so fucking stupid that they are doing this. this really sucks because i just realized that the time counter thing on this paage that keeps track of how long i have been writing is not working. so i have no idea how long i have been writing. i am quite aggitated now, i have to write for an even longer period of time to make sure that i write at least the required 20 minutes. i hope a new network decides to pick up farscape. i really hope so. it really sucks taht it is being canceled after its current season. this is totally screwed up. there is no logical explanation. every ceo and executive has to be high on something to come to this decision. i wonder how long i have been writing? i guess i t started a t about 1:44. taht is only a guess though, i reallly have no clue when i started this. i hate not having controll over a situation. i hate that there is not a whole lot i can do to reverse the fate of farscape. i hate that i don't know how long i have been writing this thisn. my leg hurts. i hope all the letters i sent to all of the higher brain function deficient scifi and usa network execs can see the error of their ways and not cancel a great show. i would like to boycott the channel but i also watch another series on it. damn me for liking stargate: sg-1!!! i wish i didn't like taht other sereies so i could wholeheardedly boycott the sons of trelks. my sister hates math, she jsut asked me a math question. i don't like teaching people things, i get easily frustrated when i know something and have explain to others. if the scifi channel was stupid enought to cancel thier highest rated show then no other program is safe, the will probably cancel stargate nec (the assholes) and then i would really have a reason to boycott. i wonder how long i have been writing this? alll of the scifi execs and usa network boneheads should be tortured for thieir stupidity in this matter. i would like to be a major contributor in their pain at this moment. those bastards. how can they do this to me? how can they do this to my sister? this blows goats. damn them. i wonder what it would be like for them to scream in uninhibited pain and angiush, does this make me a bad person? i don't think so, not at the moment. they deserve whatever the get. my sister would tie them down for me so i could get to the torturing without fear of them escaping. i think that time has run out. i don't know if it has. the damn counter is all screwed up. if i submit this and i don't get credit because i didn't write for a long enough period of time, i will be pissed. it's not my fault that this damn time thing isn't working. i wish they would reevaluate their decision to cancel. i hope this has beeen and adequate amoutn of time. well hell, i'm getting more angry writing about how wronged i have been, like everyone else that they are canceling what is possibly the greates show on the air.

"ok, i guess i should be typing, that clock is making me kind of nervous. well, whatever, i just saw my roommate, i really didn't know she was going to be here. i feel really nervous, i don't know why. oh yeah, i really need to work on my first paper for my english class. i hope i get a good grade, because when i work on it, i feel as if it should be harder that what it actually is. gosh, my math class really sucked today. i did not understand a word she was saying, but that's ok, because so did the rest of the class. i wonder what my mom is doing, oh and my dogs too. i really miss them. even though my dog hates me and is kind of crazy, i miss him so much. 6 minutes, that's it! it feels as if i've been typing forever. before i forget i need to talk to daisy today, man that girl is so crazy. i also got to talk to lillian, just to see how her day went. napoleon was being so funny last night, i really like talking to him at night, even though we talked until like midnight. i wonder what kind of music that guy is going to play in my psychology class. he usually plays weird music, today it's going to have to do with the brain, that'll be interesting, i suppose. i hope i'm doing this right. who ever reads this, if it's ever actually read, will probably think it was lame. oh, well. you're also going to find plenty of mistakes, opps my bad. gosh, that sounded like a line out of that movie: clueless. i feel clueless a lot, so that's ok. i can't wait to go to sleep, that's one of my favorite things to do ever since school started. this past 3-day weekend was great because i got to wake up so late and just hang around my dorm with my roommate. she's cool. i'm so glad i get along with my roommate, because i've been hearing some roommate horror stories lately, i guess i lucked out. wow, i've been writing for 16 minutes! i guess it was harder to get started. i wonder if the people around me think i'm writing like this really long email to someone. they're probably thinking i'm a loser, ha-ha. that's kind of funny to think about. daisy is probably talking to her internet boyfriend right now at a computer on campus. her boyfriend is so funny. some girl just sat next to me, i hope she doesn't read this. i don't know what else to say, my time is almost out. ahhhh! i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this. well my time is up, it was great, but i've got to print out my biology lecture.

"typing, what i feel, boy that is kind of odd. not to often do you get an assignment where you just write, write whatever you feel. what am feeling right about now. i mean, i just got back from my economics class, with mr. hammerhesh, or as he says the ""hammer. "" it was a crazy experience with some few hundred people crammed into his class. yesterday was an eye opening experience with one of my classes having 500 + people (yours, and then two of my teachers speak limited, and i do mean limited english. what a day, at good old university of texas. chris farley, i just thought of him, because i watched a dvd of his greatest hits. farley, to me is one of america's greatest comedians, because no matter what he was doing, he made the viewer laugh. truly an outstanding comedian, with a heart the size of texas. unfortunately like many other great hollywood actors, comedians, and musicians, he too became inundated with drugs and alcohol. like one of the characters he plays, matt foley, he played with life, and life came back to bite him, and instead of living in a van down by the river, he is living in a casket down by the prairie. so much to do, and so little time. with all these clubs an activities and class schedule, college seems like one big whirlwind. with only moments here and there to catch your breath, and sit down to relax. which organization should i join? so many options to accept, with so many good looking ones, but which ones to focus on. in high school, i did everything, and being in charge of a lot of them i was able to schedule each event around the other. but now, i am just another tadpole in the great lake. phones are ringing, but no one is singing in my crazy packed dorm room. the twenty minutes is running to end. you would have thought i would type more in twenty minutes, but since this whole streaming typing is new to me, i guess i did a good job. anyway, at least i did not copy a tv repair manual in this box and put it in. ;) well, it's on to lunch then on to many other fun classes, some immunizations, and a bike ride. but before i go, i would just like to say that apple computers are the greatest computers in the world. and, no i am not some sort of computer guru, i just think that apple computers are the easiest, coolest looking, and highest performing computers in the world. and, that my friend, is all i truly have to say. thank you, and please, have a good day.

"i haven't had a very good afternoon. i've been trying to get my ethernet hookup to work for 2 days, without success. i'm pretty ignorant when it comes to computers, so i had my friend come and hook it up for me. but to my unpleasant surprise, we couldn't get it to work! today, all afternoon, i tried and tried to figure it out. i screamed, cried, and almost threw my computer out of the window. then, just when i was about to give up, i figured it out! but, with my neverending good luck, i found out that the entire internet server was down for all of my apartment complex. so, i had to drive all the way to west campus (i live on east riverside) to use my friend's computer tonight. in other words, i'm in a pretty pissed off mood. anyway, i'm drinking one of those jack daniel's country cocktails to calm myself down. i hope it works. man, my back hurts. about 2 months ago, i fell off of a roof while sunbathing (topless, of course) and besides knocking myself unconscious, and embarrassing the hell out of myself, i fractured 2 vertebrae in my back. it was probably the most intelligent thing i've ever done. so, now that i'm slowly weaning myself off of the vicadin the doctor proscribed, i seem to be in more pain than ever. it doesn't help that i have to carry a back pack around campus everyday, either. but, what can i do? the fractures weren't big enough to require surgery, so all i can do is wait until i heal. but, according to my wonderful doctor, i wasn't supposed to be feeling any pain by now. wrong! i think i'm going to have to go back and get some more xrays. something isn't quite right. so my friend laura is getting ready for sixth street and i'm stuck here doing crappy homework. this assignment isn't so bad, but i have french homework to do after this and that's what's going to suck. i love french, but my teacher this semester bites the big one. she makes going to class a real drag for me. that's never happened before, so i'm pretty ticked off about it. gee, i hope my art history professor from last semester writes me back soon. he was supposed to change my grade from a c to a b because of some mistake in grading, and i recently checked my grade report only to find out that the grade was never changed. i want to know what the hell happened. well, my twenty minutes are up. i'm a pretty slow typist, so i hope this is enough.

"well, first i'm thinking that i should've done this a few days ago instead of on the last day. there are still a few hours left, but it's never good to procrastinate. i guess it's ok because i've been very busy lately doing work for other classes. i'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 6th street and getting drunk, which is what i thought i was supposed to be doing. some of my friends call me a hermit"" now because i'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times. i don't really care. i'd rather be responsible. i do go out though. yesterday i went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game. now i'm feeling full and satisfied because i just ate a pizza and i was extremely hungry. i haven't felt this satisfied in a while. i don't really like most of the food in the cafeteria, but the pizza is good. i miss the food at home. i miss home a lot. i miss my family even though i talk to them over the phone just about every day. it's just not the same when you are away. life at home this summer was so simple. i was just in my house very comfortable and without worries. i would go out with my girlfriend every few days. i miss her desperately. i think i was supposed to also describe what i'm smelling. i don't really smell anything right now. i wish i could smell my girlfriend's perfume again. i think that's my favorite smell of all. it's weird because i sometimes ""remember"" what the scent was. i don't think that's supposed to happen. now i'm thinking that i've been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired. oh well. it's in the name of science. now i'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this. i feel sorry for whoever has that job. sorry for writing this much. sorry for not being very interesting. now i'm remembering that i missed the rain again. i missed yesterday's rain because i was in my psychology class. when i got out, the ground was wet. it happened again today on the count of my pre cal class. now i'm thinking that i probably should've done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because i think there should be a timer above this box thingy. now i don't know when to stop. i'm probably going to stop too soon. i'll get an f in this assignment. i'll fail this class and be dropped. then i won't be considered a full time student because i'm only taking 12 hours. i'll be forced to go home, and i will go home a failure. hmm. that probably won't happen. after all, i've been having so much here, even though it is away from all that i hold dear. i think i have 10 more minutes to go. now i'm feeling that i have to go take a leak. dammit. it'll have to wait. i'm still not sure what this is for and what it studies. maybe someone will read this and say that i'm crazy. that would be funny. all i need is confirmation. now i'm thinking that my time would be better spent outside. outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy. a very pretty day. i hate being inside. i'd much rather be outside. i have a good view of the outside from my window. i'm on the seventh floor so it's pretty cool. i think i'm doing this wrong. i'm still not sure why. i think my time is coming running out. yup, i'm done.

"i am thinking back to when in class you were talking about sitting in front of the computer and wondering what to write about. i wonder what my roommate is saying ?hmmm? for. she may think it is weird that i am writing about her if she reads this. i like rice krispie treats. i just had one. i went to the vegas getaway for the business school; it was fun. my face is itching. my nose, then my neck. i really like what i've done with my hair today, but too bad it took longer than i had expected it to take. my roommate, erika, is leaving. she is going to go get something to eat. now my back is itching. i wonder why, when you itch, simply rubbing on the itching spot doesn't make the itch go away. you have to scratch it instead. wouldn't it be easier if we just didn't itch at all? i mean, what's the point of itching anyway? i guess it just makes the experience of life all the more interesting. also why is it that when you start to itch, you suddenly itch everywhere. kind of like when someone yawns and you see it, it makes you have to yawn too, even if you're not sleepy. i'm spending an awful lot of time thinking about itching. i want to take a speed reading class at the utlc. maybe it will help me in the future. but will i begin to speed-read everything if i take the course?. i like listening to music. i guess most people do really. my nose itches again. i'm glad it got cooler in this dorm room. last week it was so hot. i had to sleep on top of my blanket. the good thing is that it therefore provided more padding on these rock-hard beds. i really like the movie chicago. it's so theatrical. speaking of which, i think my sister had auditions for the high school's fall play today. i wonder how she thinks she did. i hope that she gets a part, even if it's a small one. i'm looking forward to seeing the fall production. maybe they'll make it to state oap this year. i miss being in theatre. i would like to join a theatre club, but i'm not sure i have time for the rehearsal commitment. plays are a lot of work. i really like this writing assignment you all have devised for us. it's interesting and even kind of fun. i like the box i have on my shelf. it's orange and gold, with a leaf pattern. thank goodness i only have 2 classes tomorrow. today was nonstop; 4 classes with only a 30 minute break. i had a bagel for breakfast. i wonder how early the bagel guy has to get up in order to go to his little stand and be open in time for 8 o'clock classes. i wonder if he likes his job?. he would get to meet and see a lot of people every day; that, i'm sure, is a perk or he would not be living in austin, or any big city. i'm from a small town. austin still continues to wow me with the massive number of people on campus and on the streets. oh good i get to put my pennant that i bought today up on my board in about 5 minutes. it cost $7. one about 1'3 of the size cost $6. they're probably betting on the idea that people will not check the price of both pennants and simply buy the smaller one, thinking it will cost much less. i had economics today. i think i'm beginning already to think more about the economy. at least i hope so, because if i am, that means i'll do better on the tests. there is a study session tomorrow night that i'll be attending. i need to go running later. i'm really glad that the gym is so close by. in my hometown, you had to drive 35-45 minutes just to get to a gym. so it was either waste all that time, or go run on the hard, uneven, gravel-y, county road. gravel-y is not a word but that's okay. i wonder what psychological experiences you all will get by reading these assignments. 5 seconds left. oh okay my time is up but i get to finish my thought. i'm going to go study now. i have to read my psych book for your class tomorrow.

"i am sitting at my small desk, looking at my computer i am not sure what i should be writing about, so i just type my shoulders hurt and i am ready to go to bed but i have so much more to do before i leave tomorrow to go home i am excited about seeing rich i wonder what we will do i know i have to work a lot and i w2ill probably be tired when i am done, but i will probably still want to go out because all i do here is work, study, work out, and try to keep my life in order cleaning my root day was a pain in the ass, finding places for everything sucked, and i still am not done. it will feel like a dark cloud over my head until everything is in place, which is likely to never occur. my roommate passed out tonight while studying. she works crazy hard and is so focused. right now she keeps mumbling in her sleep. it is pretty funny. i hope i don't disturb her. i don't know if she would want me to wake her up because she fell asleep in her clothes and stuff on her book. i'll probably just turn the lights off or something like that. i am craving some ice cream right now. i want vanilla frozen yogurt with granola. mmmmm. that will be my reward for getting this done early. i am glad that i finished my astronomy assignment tonight. it was just another thing that was hanging over my head. i have all this damn reading to do. and i can't seem to get past any of it because the second i finish one chapter, there is another chapter due in that book and in my other classes. plus studying for that menu test. it should be fine though. i always get more stressed than i need to over everything. i like my laptop, but these keys piss me off. i don't understand why certain things happen. the cursor moves and it messes up what i am typing. grrrrr. i also want a diet coke. i am having trouble understanding why people gain 15 lbs when they go to school. i walk my ass off to and from classes. i am so afraid that i am going to gain weight. i didn't have time to make it to the swimming pace today. grrrrr. and i haven't done the firm today either. i really should. i need do. but i woke up too damn late to do it. i hope i get up at a good time tomorrow morning. i wonder when rich is going to call. i think when i finish this i am going to take a shower. that will feel good, and rich will probably call super late, whenever fox's closes. i miss him. i hope he is having fun, i wish i was 21 already. it is such a pain in the ass. i feel so much older. this juv del class is totally opening up my eyes to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking. and it is making me seriously doubt the stigma of underage drinking. i know they have their reasons, young drinking affecting high school, and drinking and driving accidents and whatnot, but still. how can i be treated as an adult in the court system, work place, and everything else, but still not be allowed to drink alcohol? that doesn't make sense at all to me. how can my friends be allowed to fight in war yet not drink beer? that is silly. and frustrating. and now that i know how the laws came to be how they are, i am even more stupefied by it. i love that class and teacher. he teaches basically directly out of the book, so i just have to skim read it, and that is pretty awesome. and his lecture is interesting, and he makes me laugh. that is so important. a sense of humor is everything. i like my nut teacher too, but learning that stuff makes me fee guilty for eating. if these damn pop-ups don't stop soon, i am going to have a serious problem. i am glad i am leaving again this weekend. even though everyone says leaving is bad, i still have a great time at home. and right now, i don't feel like i am missing out on anything here. i am going to try to balance it well, but i love spending time with rich. i love him, and i think he brings out the best in me. he has such a great sense of humor. and i laugh all the time when i am with him. i laughed so much at dinner tonight with them and bryttne. not at brytt so much, but em and i are so open ",0,-0.12067 0.708375 1.207064 0.837357 0.889898 0.703477 -0.135831 -0.655584 -0.1835 0.590989 -0.188184 -0.162201 -0.461054 0.807869 0.273387 0.0 -0.04277 0.49064 0.571411 -0.600849 0.44108 -0.742368 0.396225 -0.59693 -0.18552 -1.02045 -0.498268 -0.607197 1.397057 1.120499 1.194533 0.530206 0.961787 0.111942 0.596977 -0.189959 -0.025414 0.297439 -0.566362 0.037948 -0.574821 -0.229075 -0.068399 0.668643 -0.118751 -0.893709 1.148282 -0.82844 -1.116084 0.086344 -0.936242 0.388623 -1.113847 1.407523 1.06875 0.500581 0.295848 0.601479 0.859673 0.17249 0.724357 0.368338 -0.480161 0.256549 2.110165 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.32045 0.459885 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.157603 -0.37208 -0.162104 -0.422267 -0.875985 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.146399 5.400219 4.098784 4.474476 5.123052 4.422415
"right now i'm sitting here at the computer wondering what i'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. there is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. my computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. i keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! there is a lot of stuff on my desk, i need to clear it off. i also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. i forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. i need to study for chemistry because i have a quiz in there at 12:30. i tried to last night, but i kept on getting distracted. i don't feel like doing this right now. i want to go to sleep. i just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all i want to do is sleep. by the time i get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. i can't think of anything to type. i want to light a candle. i have a lot of time left and i still need to write. i'm not sure what about though. this weekend i'm not sure what i'm going to do, but i guess i'll have fun. i did last weekend. i need to do some reading for my classes, and i can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that i don't have any classes on friday. right now i am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in houston. we plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and dag are planning it. next weekend i am going to the ut houston game and then right after that i plan on going home because the 24th is my dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. that will be a busy weekend. the following one is my friend's birthday. my computer is still making some annoying noise. i can't think of anything to type. i have 10 minutes left of typing. hopefully i can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. i'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because i noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. that would be very annoying to deal with, if i lived there! so i'm glad i don't. yesterday there was a lot of traffic. today i get out of school at 3:30 and i have a trig review class at 5:30. i wish i didn't have to go, but i get extra credit for my calculus class, which i figure i will need. i need to balance my checkbook. i think i'll do that when i finish typing this. i'm going to listen to some cd's when i finish this too. i don't feel like studying, and i guess i'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. i wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, i'll have to check that out in a minute. my desk is really cluttered, i need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that i keep on forgetting about. well, i have a lot more stuff to do than i thought! it's driving me crazy that i keep on making so many typos, i never have this problem. wow, i've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! that's kind a cool. i thought that a i would have written more in 20 minutes though. i guess not. surprisingly the time went by very quickly, i didn't think that it would. i guess in a minute i will log on so that i can get on to the psychology website and send this in.

"it is now 4:10 pm, that means i have to do this stupid assignment until 4:30. it's probably beneficial for the psychologists at this school, though. i think i am going off the page now so i will press return okay, that line was probably fucked up but that's okay. i wonder how long it will take to get on a computer tomorrow. it didn't take too awfully long today. i used to be able to type faster than this, i think. i am out of practice from summer. i can't write as well, either. not that i was very good to begin with. this is going to seem like a really long time. i was going to say take a long time, but it's only twenty minutes, which doesn't seem like that long in theory, but it really is. i am not looking at the screen and my writing is going everywhere. i wonder what the other people said, and if they noticed that this thing doesn't automatically scroll down as you type. it's good to do this on the internet because it saves a lot of paper waste, but it's annoying to have to come here and wait for a computer when i'm used to just writing things on paper at home. i wonder if jonathan had emailed me yet-- i will check on that after i finish this thing. doh!- it's only 4:16. i have a really long time. i wonder if he can tell whether or not people cheat and cut it short. if you can type really fast then you can get a lot done. i wonder how fast i type in comparison with everyone else. i should have learned how to touch type before i came to college. i still use the hunt and peck version staring at the keyboard. it's hard to do that when you're transcribing a paper or something that you aren't thinking of as you go. i'm getting tired. this reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa is rambling on and on and nobody is listening or cares what he says. ""ewww. what smells like mustard?"". i love that show. i can't wait until the new season starts. i wonder if we'll win the simpson's house that would solve all our problems for the rest of our lives. never having to do what we don't want to do. but it would be annoying to live in. i think you can tell a lot about a person by knowing to what degree he or she likes the simpsons. some idiots like my dad just think it's a cartoon, but it's really so much more. i should really finish that chapter that i didn't read. it was interesting enough, i just didn't have very much time to read. oh, i forgot some of my books, and i don't want to walk all the way to the dobie to get them. it's so hot! i'm so lazy. no wonder i'm a big fat cow, i can't even walk half a block to get my books. i should really start riding my bike again. i like the bus. it's so much easier and i don't have to carry my bike down those fucking stairs. i've climbed more stairs today than i have in a long time. i wonder if i'll ever be able to go running without dying-- i think i'm just not built for it. andy is so athletic, and i'll never be as fit as he is, and i'm really just slowing him down. yay, it's 4:26, only 4 more minutes. i wonder if you freaks are actually going to read all 500 of these things. yeah, what is the point of this stupid thing, anyway? i could see the point of that research project, but not this. you can't possibly read all these. m back hurts. i should probably try to have better posture. but i like to conserve energy. again, laziness. two more minutes. i'm tired, i think the sun drains all the energy out of me. i'm really sick of this stupid thing, and the minutes are going by so slow. it's really irritating me. i can' t wait to get to my email! i wonder how many messages i got in the last 3 weeks. well, it's now 4:30 bye.

"just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. i think it would be wise if i put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. today i went to a meeting for kvr news and received tons of information about the station and what i needed to do if i wanted to be apart of it. the meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. my head was spinning by the time i left the station. i learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. i feel as though i am behind in life right now. i'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. i still feel as though as i am at camp not in my new home. my other friends already feel comfortable here. it also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that i can't fit into a twenty four hours! i miss my best friend named dana. she went to tulane. she is doing well which makes me happy. speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. this is impressive because a year ago i was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. now i am a firm believer. you see, about three months ago i met a beautiful guy by the name of john. he is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. this has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship i have ever been in. john makes me feel pretty. he looks out for me and he loves me. when i am with him i am completely happy. another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the jester cafeteria has been coming through. of course, i have to focus in quantity not quality! whenever i eat there i get lost in the selections. so much to eat so little space! though i reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. when i was filling out my pretesting questionnaire i started to feel depressed. all the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how i handled issues. i'm not good at issues. i tend to bottle things up. i'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. this combination is dangerous. sometimes i wonder if i have made wise choices. i wonder if my parents miss me. i wonder if my friends long to see me too. my selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. one minute i am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next i am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. it is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. i am very thankful for what god has given me.

"i am at my friends house right now because i don't have a computer to use at my home. i just decided to get this assignment over with. this room is really hot. there are four people in this house right now. jack, richard, julie, sarah, and me. my girlfriend, sarah is asking everyone of us to quiz her on her vocabulary that she has to memorize by friday. it is very noisy in here and jack is telling me to shut up. i really want to get drunk and have fun but i can't because i have school tomorrow. i need to stay focused on my school work and keep myself in control. i'm only a freshmen and i'm really worried about ut because of the horror stories all my upperclassmen friends told me about. my father told me to concentrate on my studies because it is my responsibility to do excellent in school. he said that it is my life that i'm preparing for, not his. i'm also using my money because i'm using the loan that i received. i've been dating my girlfriend for two and half months and i think we're doing good. everything is working just right. i cant wait till this weekend so i don't have to worry about school for about two days. actually, i have to do some reading and a short homework. i wonder if anyone sent me a e-mail. i better check it when my twenty minutes is up. i cant believe how much money i spent ever since i came to austin. i spent so much on food, clothes, gas, and more food. oh yeah, and mostly important, the books! (yeah right!) oh man! i did so bad in philosophy today. i read my homework but still got a zero because the quiz was a little tricky. this is kind of fun expressing my thoughts on the computer. oh! twenty minutes are up! bye bye!

" i wonder why i am so depressed. i don't know if depressed is the word i should be using, but i am down on myself because i am a freshman in college and i feel like everyone is way better than me. i didn't do well on the math portion of the sat test, so i needed a waiver to get into a ut math class. i wanted to take pre-calculus, but the math advisor didn't think i could handle it. so now i'm wondering if i really can or can't. i mean i thought i could because i took pre-cal in high school and did exceptionally well, but now i'm all confused. am i really smart like i thought i was? or did my brain turn to mush over the summer and i can't even hold a decent conversation now? i don't even think i belong here at ut. i think i only got accepted because i was in the top 10% of my high school class. i hope i do well. i feel like i'm going to fail and drop out. i really want to hang in there, but it's hard with 50,000 people, plus other colleges throughout the world. i know that's life, but i can't help feeling this way about myself. i feel like no one cares, and the only person i can really trust and depend on is my boyfriend of 4 yrs. i love hector! he's always been there for me and continues to be. i'm lucky to have him. college is confusing. i can't believe i dropped out of their business school. but i figured if i wanted to pursue a career in the health field, i made the right decision. i just don't know what i want to do though. everyone keeps saying that the first 2 yrs of college don't matter because you're just taking your basic courses, but i think it does matter because certain field have prerequisites and you don't want to waste your electives on things that won't apply to what you want to become. but what do i want to become?? i really hope i go the right direction because i do not want to waste thousands of dollars on a major i won't even pursue or enjoy. i either want to become an occupational therapist, dental hygienist, or physical therapist. i think physical therapy is too hard though. right now i'm leaning more towards occupational therapy, so i hope i actually go through with everything. i keep hearing statistics of how a lot of freshman drop out, and i hope i am not so completely lazy to the point where i'm one of those freshman. i know my boyfriend hector will make it because he's in the tip program and has a lot of encouragement. but i am going to have to provide myself my own encouragement because i know nobody else cares about my standings. i need to start getting involved in community services and activities like everyone recommends. i don't understand how some people have time to be into everything, hold a job, and handle school at the same time. that is almost impossible for me. they are truly talanted. i think the homework itself is too much work. i hope i don't get fat. ever since i graduated and stopped being in drill team, i feel way more lazy and i gained 6 lbs. i exercised a whole lot this summer and have not lost an ounce. i feel like everything i worked for in the summer meant nothing because i have nothing to show for it. i hope my boyfriend still loves me in return because i see so many pretty girls in college hoping hector will not fall for them. he says he loves only me, but i am hesitant to believe him. i would be very sad if he left me because we have so much together. but then again he's always been such a wonderful boyfriend and i should have no reason to doubt him. i know i should be less insecure about myself but it's hard. i tell myself to do one thing and it's like i don't even follow my own orders. hey, my cell phone is ringing. i wonder who it is. probably angela. i miss her. ever since she moved to arizona i don't have anyone to hang around with. come to think of it i haven't had a true friend since my sophomore year in high school. it's always been just me and hector with no one else to call my best friend. angela was my best friend until she found a boyfriend. but she's still my best friend and i love her to death. i came into college with intentions of meeting new people and finding new friends, but i haven't had any luck so far. the only thing close to a friendship was on friday at the union when some guy who recognized me from his sociology class invited me to bowl with him. i would have but i didn't have any socks, so i watched instead. he was cute, but i feel guilty for thinking he's cute and having a boyfriend at the same time. i also feel guilty because sometimes i find myself attracted to the same sex. i don't know if i'm attracted to them or if i just want to be like them. i'm confused. but i try not to let it get to me. i'm curious about a lot of things, but it's hard to try any of them because my parents are way overprotective! other adults say my parents are always right and that i'll understand them one day. i am very grateful that i have such caring parents, but sometimes i wish they would ease up on me. i hate when they try to pick my friends for me and forbid me to hang out with certain people because of their sexuality or the way they choose to live their life. i think i should pick my own friends. the people i used to hang around with were just fine. they didn't engage in drugs or anything. i liked them for them and my parents could not see what i saw. it's like they expect my friends to be perfect for them and do not consider the way i feel at all. it's frustrating!! even though i'm 18 i don't feel like it all. my parents still treat me like i'm 14 and cannot think for myself. i just wish there was some way to get them to see things my way. i've already tried talking to them one on one, but they do not listen to me what-so-ever. they have a one track mind and feel that everything they say is right. i keep telling myself that one day it'll all change, but i'm scared that it may never change. i used to argue with my parents all the time because we shared a difference in opinion, but after a while i realized there is just no winning with them. i don't really tell them how i feel anymore because it's not like they're going to listen to me anyway. it's like they have to hear it from an adult rather than myself. even then, they'd probably go with their own judgement anyway.

" i miss my family. they mean a great deal to me and and love them very much. without my best friend, sam, here with me, i wouldn't be here writing this thing. i have never been away from home for more than 10 days and it is something that i know will take some time to get used too. this weekend i will get to see my family and one of my other best friends, ben, and his family. sam and i are going to meat them at lake lbj friday afternoon. wakeboarding, my family and friends, it will be great, i can't wait until friday. ut is a lot harder than the junior college i used to go to, its on whole other level and thats why i'm here. its time for me to go to the next level and do what i do best, create. i have met a lot of really good people over the last 2 weeks, my friend sam introduced me to ruf, its a bible study for college kids, its good me and i like it. sam also introduced me to ultimate frisbee, its totally sweet, i'm thinking of playing intermurals, last year the ruf team won the damn thing. i feel more alone right now than i ever have in my life and i think i'm taking it pretty good. i talk to my family everyday and that helps, but when i walk in my door there isn't anybody there who loves me or who asks me how my day was it hurts. its something that only time can heal. i'm at the age when its time to leave the nest so to speak and i've been ready, then questioned myself, then proved my readiness again. my desire to create and express myself grows everyday, as soon as i gain ascess to a darkroom my work will be some of the best i have ever produced to this date. i have never had these intence feallings and i think they will show in my prints. i also have the desire to write a song, my friend garret, that i met through ruf, and is also one of sams roomates, writes songs and plays the guitar. i know i can't sing and i know i can't play so writting seems to be a good choice for musical expression.

i am wondering why i am doing this writing assignment and if i really have to because i am doing the research also. the music that i am listening to right now is very loud. i wonder if i should go to class today. i am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that i didn't know about. the test coming up on the 15th worries me because i am not sure what it will be over or what to study. my forearm is already beginning to cramp up while i am typing. my leg itches. i like this song that is coming on now. my eyes are very tired. my head itches and i have to scratch it. i think i need to stretch my neck. i really need to start getting more sleep since i have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. there is something under my foot that is bothering me. i wonder how long i have been typing for. only five minutes. now i am feeling like this is going to take forever. it is kind of dark in the room that i am in. i'm thinking about pizza. now i am thinking about the girl who's room i am in. she is in the shower. i ate pizza with her for lunch. she is very beautiful. she sure has been in the shower for a long time. dave matthew's songs all sound alike to me. i can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 90's or something. my mind has gone blank for a second. what time is it now. only 8 minutes. how come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. if i was a girl i wouldn't get one. that would hurt and why go through that pain. i think the music is getting louder. cell phones! everybody is getting those too. and they keep getting smaller. that reminds me of lethal weapon 4 when chris rock complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. i can't think of anything. i am wondering if i really have to do this. time check. 12 minutes. it is hot. it smells like austin water. the water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. i need a chair in my room so when i watch tv i don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. my back is hurting right now. basketball caused my back problems. i should be playing basketball right now. everybody thinks i am obsessed with basketball because i talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. i want to be a basketball coach. i can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where i can't play or coach. i have to be a coach or i won't enjoy my job. this girl kim drops everything on her feet. i swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since i have been here. she just interupted my train of thought. i kind of like this stream of thought thing because i am realizing all the crazy stuff i think about in a given time. this song satellite. i mean what the hell is he talking about. it doesn't make since. time check. one more minute till i get to hit the infamous submit button. this was kind of fun. my arm is kind of tired though. ,0,-1.418712 1.314797 1.337113 0.791947 0.038345 0.50037 0.013296 -0.637919 -0.349989 -0.132261 -0.22078 -0.590446 -0.018152 0.616349 0.009268 0.0 -0.04277 0.355115 0.337322 -0.795527 0.141672 -0.004842 0.217886 -1.570975 -0.624052 -0.119971 -0.287689 0.275309 -0.28339 -0.36458 0.018331 -1.066732 0.002679 -0.023893 -1.017959 0.484052 -0.264684 2.063162 0.175922 -0.932465 -1.038726 -0.79618 0.789749 -0.180816 -0.74801 -0.417953 0.525373 -0.363151 0.006011 0.079487 -0.012221 0.130922 -0.703018 0.788462 -0.125668 -0.256905 0.449518 -0.280182 -0.681571 -0.80791 -0.554671 -1.280296 0.473791 0.122878 -0.115124 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.967429 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.173409 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.35323 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.410882 4.978386 3.998192 5.087947 4.990419 4.346606
today was a tough day for me. i can't believed i failed to talk to asweenee. no girl has ever had that much power on me. its probably the sun kicking in. i can't wait to go to the football game on saturday. ut is definitely going to beat rutgers b'c rutgers lost last week to a weak team by more than 20 points. calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. i hope we get no homework or else i will be very busy wed. night. that phone next door is driving me crazy! why does kyle have the ringer on so high? i need to buy the bush cd soon. the songs on that cd will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to asweenee. i hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that i am not some weird freak. neal seems to enjoy studying chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. i guess he feels insecure about his ability in chemistry. i hope the giants win next week at jacksonville. it should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. who cares about the cowboys? tonight i want to email steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. maybe things will clear up the next few days and i will finally have the courage to do what i am so good at: socializing. i have never froze up like this in a long time. maybe i am thinking too much about screwing up. i know i am better than that. baseball season is almost near the homestretch. i hope the yankees can catch up to the orioles and go back to the world series. my parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. i wondering how linh is adjusting at rice? i hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing paul because i am not there to help her get through this hard time. i am glad i was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. i really miss her a lot but at the same time i know she will be fine. i sound like her parents. i wonder how craig's drive to minnesota is? his dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. this room needs more ac. ac. the idiot next door is blaring his music. spice girls suck! if he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. i think i am starting to feel the effects of the hunan chicken. that stuffed dog looks like snoopy. neal must be attached to this toy. ,0,-0.112559 0.638396 -0.912873 0.886331 -0.083724 -0.284809 0.642294 0.200316 -0.569293 -0.688899 -0.199 0.775859 1.383621 0.755872 0.85993 0.0 -0.04277 -1.16081 -0.973796 -0.466561 -1.153072 -0.742368 1.407204 1.31134 0.116978 1.120563 -0.029688 -0.833766 1.253377 0.731663 0.3539 2.829779 1.046937 0.240747 -0.23827 0.962065 0.596687 1.522974 0.982956 0.073757 0.529085 0.851643 -0.378059 0.289653 -0.10056 0.650511 -0.25168 0.925041 0.8494 0.561224 -0.65291 0.409627 -0.98649 0.83077 1.51663 -0.056736 1.964939 -0.954251 -1.480395 -1.037224 0.46119 0.478814 -0.480161 -0.18095 0.575612 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.186431 -1.364578 0.12731 -0.23436 0.913737 0.144463 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.183983 -0.451544 -0.037619 -0.868729 4.573479 4.118152 4.217063 4.557049 4.408867
"this is really weird. what am i doing here. what am i supposed to write about. who came up with this assignment anyway. well whatever. ill just do it and ill get the credit and that's it. i wonder where nauman is right now. i called him but no answer. where could he be. i had fun this weekend. i think. well it was better then what i normally do, stay home and watch tv. i wonder what woren and sahara are up to. i don't spend anytime with friends anymore. i want to go back to dallas and see everyone. well i guess i can do that this weekend when i go back. its hot in here. its so hot everywhere. well actually i don't want to go back home this weekend. in a way i do, and in a way i don't. i feel like i'm keeping a journal. oh crap i think my contacts are about to pop out. see if i go home this weekend, then i will be giving up freedom. but if i don't go home this weekend then, my parents will be like why don't you want to come home? do you like austin that much that you don't even want to come see your family anymore?? which of course is not true. i actually don't like austin. well it smells everywhere in austin. dobie smells, dobie garage smells, wal-mart smells, foleys smells, everywhere, austin stinks, literally. i wonder how farzana and carey are at baylor. i'm glad they came down this weekend. otherwise i would have been bored off my butt. you can really count on family to be there for you when you need them. but sometimes it can be really annoying. like my mom, everyday, what did you do, did you go to class, did you eat, what did you eat. it gets on my nerves. but i love her. i guess i am kind of looking forward to going home. i mean i get to see all my friends again. and sabeen is going to dartmouth so i can say bye to her to before i leave. but i think the hardest thing to do will be the transitions on friday and sunday. i'm here now and i want to stay here, not keeping moving again and again. i hate change. and then if i go home this weekend, then ill have to pack and say goodbye to everyone on sunday, and i hate good-byes. they are so sad and then when i'm say bye, ill want to come back to dallas, and ill hate austin even more. that's why i don't want to go back. this feels kind of good like typing all this. maybe ill start keeping a log or something so i can put all my thoughts in it. my hands are getting tried now. i never realized how long 20 mins really was. how much longer do i have? 8 more mins. great. where in the hell is nauman? what is he doing?? i'm going to call him after this and see if he's there now. he better be. i miss him. i wonder if he misses me too. i hope so. when is he coming back to austin. i could go see him this weekend, but we both know that's not going to work. his friends are all going home this weekend so he'll want to spend time with them and his parents are out of town so i'm sure he'll want to go out with them. but then what about me? what about unlimited weekends??? rrahhh. this is frustrating. i wonder if he is still in love with him old girlfriend. i think he is. but whatever. i don't care. he can be in love with him old girlfriend. who cares. i'm just going to let things happen. i mean that is the best way right. you can't make someone fall in love with you. actually i myself don't know if i really like him. its weird. when i'm not with him, i really want to be with him and when i'm with him, its just ok. i mean i do like spending time with him, he's really funny and the time flies when where together, but its just not what i expect it to be. i guess it will just take time. ok 3 more mins. great. that wasn't that bad. i guess ill do the other assignment tomorrow since you can't do both on one day. i have so much to do today. that stupid ba 101 assignment is due today and i have to d the prestesting for psy, but the stupid webpages isn't working for it. just my luck, since i want to use it, its not working. i wonder if i really have to read those 2 books for class tomorrow. if we do, i'm screwed. i wonder what mona and charu look like. he talks about them all the time. i wonder if i met them, what they would think of me and what he has told them about me so far. where is he. let me go call him right now! should i email him? well if i could ever get my stupid email to work, i would. how come he doesn't email me? oh yeah , wait he does doesn't he. i don't know how he emailed me when he was here. i mean i wouldn't have done it if i was him. i don't think at least. i mean he had a girlfriend and everything going. how did he do it? well whatever it was, i'm glad he did. ok good times up.

"as the past couple of weeks have flown by, i have been stressed about my work load. like probably most college students i have the urge to wait for the last minute before starting any assignments. so far and usually i am always able to get my work done on time, however if i would only start the assignments a little earlier i would not have as much stress as i do now. also after recently reading the first chapter of my psychology book i am wondering if the cause of my illness is to due to excessive stress. on tuesday i started to have a runny nose which later progressed into a sore throat. i usually do not fall victim to illness very easily so i am almost sure that stress is playing a large part in it. at my house in irving i had gotten use to having my friends and family all within a five minute drive. now that i have moved to austin and been separated from home for an extended period of time, i occasionally find it hard to balance my time. with the options of sleep, tv, eating, homework, video games, or just hanging out with my friends, it is hard to make a decision on both what i want to do and what i need to do. on the up side of things i feel like i am slowly becoming accustomed to my new life here in austin. i have started to develop a study pattern and my urge and will to do work on time and efficiently has increased. over the fall and spring semester my ultimate goal is to have a high enough grade point average to transfer into the business school. if that transfer is successful it will only give me more motivation to try harder and be a better student. that is certainly the goal of me being a college student to begin with. i am looking forward to continuing my hard work and hope to enjoy the benefits at the end of the year.

"it is now eleven o'clock and i'm getting hungry for lunch. i don't know why i'm hungry, i just ate a couple of hours ago. i really wish i didn't get hungry so often. sometimes i think i'm not really hungry, but i just like eating. i'm not overweight, but i really haven't felt good about my body for a couple of months now because i've been away and too busy to go to the gym as often as i used to. i'm worried that when i go back home to california in a couple of months for thanksgiving people are going to think i've gained weight. when i go back i want to look good, even better than when i left. i can't wait to go home, well actually, i can. i know when i get home i'm going to wish that i was still back here. my dorm room is already starting to feel like home to me. i was really upset that joe didn't call last night. it's been over two weeks since i talked to him last and he had promised to call the next day. i don't even have his phone number so there's no way i can reach him. i swear, that boy drives me mad! oh, well, i'm not going to think about him any more. i'm really glad to finally be doing this assignment. i've been meaning to but my computer isn't set up so it's been impossible to do. i am so frustrated with this whole ethernet thing. i've been to the store so many times and they never have the part i need. finally i thought about using the computer lab here in kinsolving. it's really nice as a matter of fact. it feels good to be on a computer again. i miss mine from home even though i wasn't on it very much. i wonder if anyone will ever really read this paper. i think i would laugh at half the stuff i've written. i don't know why i'm telling you these things, you don't even know, or care, who joe is or that i have a computer. this place just got really full, it's weird how people seem to come in clumps. have you ever noticed that at places there will be no line and then all the sudden there's a huge long line? that's weird, i think. i miss my dog. he died this summer while i was away in germany. i just wish i'd given him more attention when i was home. i knew he would die some day, but i just never thought it would be so soon. i miss the meyers. that's the family i was with in germany. they were so nice to me, i felt like part of the family. not many people get to do all the cool stuff i've been blessed enough to experience. i love to travel, but it's always so nice to be home. i was never bored this summer. that's a first for me. i'm almost always bored. i didn't get any letters today. that's the first time i haven't gotten any since i've been here. it kind of sucks. sorry for swearing, i don't usually swear. i still have ten minuets to write. i'm running out of things to say. you must be so bored by now. someone is playing music in the lobby. it's really annoying me. i can't wait to go to sleep tonight. why am i always so tired. i don't even care if i go out anymore. i'm so jealous of my roommate. she is always doing cool stuff with her sorority and i haven't done much yet. she's really cute. i love her curly hair. we tried to make mine curly but it was more of a wave. it looked good, but i didn't know what other people would think about it. i just realized people could e-mail me down here that's good because people have been bugging me for my address. i can't wait until my computer is running. i'm so excited for the football game on saturday, i just hope it's not too hot. i hope we beat ucla because a lot of my friends are going there and i know that they'll think of me when they see ut and i want them to be jealous that the longhorns won. that's bad that i want them to be jealous. it's not really what i want, i just want them to think of me. it would be really neat if i could get on tv then they could see me here and know that i'm okay and having fun. i really am having fun, but it sounds so fake when i tell people that, like i'm just pretending or something. ljliujiojkl ",0,-1.236194 1.110756 0.347314 0.818333 1.215253 -0.05439 -1.60446 -1.101263 -0.638369 0.723522 -0.182976 -0.379472 -1.055135 -0.313136 -1.615159 0.0 -0.04277 0.891745 0.995691 -0.421962 0.936901 -0.016522 0.087635 0.346802 -0.203305 -1.110883 -0.790808 -0.434915 0.605367 0.510475 0.551042 -0.624507 0.343635 -0.254904 0.531482 -0.227245 0.208475 -0.193985 0.522661 0.52747 0.296547 0.061969 0.042183 0.004537 -0.171911 -0.089862 0.10143 -0.368775 -0.471533 -0.12117 0.229368 0.571683 0.776752 -0.664802 0.126155 -0.630146 -0.857537 -0.456705 -1.304431 -0.06464 0.445888 -0.655815 -0.128094 0.215922 -0.228179 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.25122 -0.065842 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.391843 -0.225437 -0.1692 -0.422267 2.366645 -0.451544 0.0127 0.78277 4.963823 3.76988 4.947354 4.968954 4.484241

"tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. i've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as i've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.

"i got very bored doing my chemistry homework so i decided to do my psy. i am very excited about tomorrow night because my sorority is having a mixer. i am a little confused about what is going on with my ex-boyfriend. i guess since that is what i am thinking about i might as well write about it. i don't understand why boys expect so much from girls when they are starting college. sometimes it really gets on my nerves how they expect you to come see them in another town every chance you have. they must not understand that we have other things to do. they are not always more important, but they are things that we are obligated to. for example, all i have heard about for the past year before i even came to school here was how bad sororities are. that is the biggest bunch of bull i have ever heard. i am now in a sorority, broken up with my boyfriend and having the best time hanging out with my friends. now he is telling me that it is great that i am in a sorority, but i just think it is a bunch of crap. he is just telling me what i want to hear. i have done it plenty of time. anyways, why worry about that. well on to a new subject. i love how brain wanders in very different directions all the time. like tonight, i planned on staying in my room and making the most out of my time. well since i love my friends so much, when one of them called me and asked me to take him to his truck, i got up and did it. i wasted an hour and a half just out talking to people i did not know. oh well, i made a couple of new friends. i also hate it when the phone rings non stop and every call is for me and i have to stop reading to talk to these people who call asking me how i like college. what do they think i'm going to say, that i hate it and want to go back to litttle bitty bay city. yea right! i was excited though when my aunt called and told me to come over any time i want to. and when i got to talk to my best friend in the world it was a lot of fun. anyways, i don't even have the slightest idea what i am writing about because i can't remember what i have said. i guess i am getting crs like my mom. i guess it happens when you have more things to organize and think about. i am really glad that my parents made me take typing in high school because i would have a problem typing all of this if i could not type. i am really pumped up about the football game this weekend. i am so glad that a group of us are going. well my time is almost over and then i can go up to my room and mark off one assignment from my list that i made. i am really glad that i am an organized person and take on responsibility well. so far organizing time for all of my homework and all of my social activities has gone rather well. i have not had to miss anything and i have kept up with my reading. well since this is not a grade, i guess since i rambled on it is o. k. my mind is not thinking very complex right now. just very simple no brained thoughts after a very long day of classes!

"right now i am thinking about what all my friends are doing. i just finished emailing them for the first time since i figured out how to do email in the computer lab. its wierd being away from home. but i've decided i fel only as if i am away to cheerleading camp and its just a little longer that it normally is. i am loving college life so far. i feel like i've been managing my time fairly well, but i get annoying constantly when i feel somewhat disorganizee. there is a lot to remember and things that i guess we are supposed to know as freshamn that i have no clue about. i just joined a sorority and i am stating to realize how time- demanding it is. but my grades are far more important to me. i am nervous about my classes because in high school i was used to a's (except in chemistry). i am hopefully going to tranfer from engineering to business possible business honors if i do well enough so i want to do really well. i have been doing my readings, but i was never the best test taker. i am not used to the big classes, and tey make me uncomfortable thats why i would love to be in an honors program where the classes are smaller. i am the type of student who likes to have a perwsonal relationship with my teachers, and i don't feel like i can approach them in such a large setting. people who know me find this to be odd because i am nortmally quite outgoing no matter the situation. today during class, we talked about how a majority of first year students go through depression. i think i've been trying to avoid it by keeping very busy, but i guess i somewhat am. i miss my family and my best friend vera at southwest. i even miss my teachers aned my old high school. at my high school everyone knew who i was and rspected me, or looked up to me in a way. i was a cheerleader, and the top of my class. here i'm just a number. but i'm the type of person who likes challenges, so i don't think its depression. i just look at this experience as another challenge to face in order to achieve success at a higher level. my classes and teachers are all really good- which i expected since i spent a majority of orientation researching them. i just hope i have success in all my classes. i would really love to go home at christmas with a 4. 0 which i don't think is completely unreasonable. a lot of people are counting on me to do well, my parents, my family (7 younger brothers and sisters), my extended family. its almost stressful. there is so much to do hre in austin. it is fun but i will need to prioritize sun-thur. its wierd not having anyways to tell you what to do, or when to do it. but its also nice to not have the responsibility of 9 other family memebers. i always had to make sure i didnt need t6o help my parents with driving, babysitting, or house work before i got to do any of my own things. they definelty relied on me less second semester which was really cool of them. i have much more free time then last year too because i ony have to worry about myself (that sounds selfish) but i don't need to check up on 9 other peoples lives before i take care of my own business. of coure, i still make it my business to know what they are doing because our family life was gret. there are so many personalities. we are all so unique, and it was definetly a challenge learning how to cope and adapt to each one. i think my parents are stil having fun doing it- i bet theyre glad to have gotten rid of one- but at the same time they miss me - i know. i think i have the best parents ever. they love me so much!!!!

"right now i'm thinking about the situation i am going through with my two roommates. school has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. i really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. i'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers i am beginning to encounter. i can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. i hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. i also miss my mom very much. even though i don't talk to her everyday on the phone, i can hear speaking to me with her heart. the same thing goes for me too. my classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. i don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. it really is a big change for me being here at a university. back home school was a breeze. now i can actually feel that i'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. the good side to that is that i like challenges. one of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to florida. there isn't anything wrong with that because he's ""in love"". i hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. i really care about him and i wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. although, i have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. my other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. i miss them all the time but i know that me being here is the best thing for me. for some reason i can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in san antonio because she is attending st. mary's university. there has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there.

"this is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. that is the only class i actually enjoy going to. they have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. almost all my classes except for english have 456,897,456,789 people in it. there is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. that's what college is all about. that's why i came from louisiana to texas. new people. it's so different out here. i love my roommates. they are so cute, and have really cute friends. i have one that is my favorite though. that's gibby. he's so cute. anyway lisa is so mad that the damn computer won't work. i believe that is a direct quote. she want to go call adam, her lifeguard lover. sometimes i think she's jealous because i found my little gilbert within 5 days of coming to the great state of texas. at first i didn't like it here, but now i love it. i know 345,231,859,635 guys, and about 4 girls. today i got to go with brady, our fine neighbor to go wash his rodeo. i got to vacuum. it was great. i love him. but not as much as i (secretly) love room 1432. the bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. i hate to stand up. i hate that almost as much as i hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. i think it's the extra elbow room that i get. i hate those desks too. i am used to having about 565 sq. feet of desk area. oh well. anyway, yesterday, i bought gibby some boxer shorts. i gave the salesman a hard time because i didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. i don't want to limit myself so soon after coming to texas. i want someone to play with, but i also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. there is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that marc likes me. i think marc is an awesome guy, but i don't know how willing i am to give gibby up. it has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where gilbert is, and what he's doing. okay, i may talk to the boy but i don't know every single blessed move he makes. now as for dark chad across the street i would like to know. he is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay i think my time is up, so ill say good bye till tomorrow. thank you, simone theriot ",0,-0.87878 -0.215507 0.526251 0.041963 -0.10121 1.142937 -1.094354 -0.317967 -0.551369 -0.730552 -0.222073 -0.590446 0.968508 -0.665509 -1.455491 0.0 -0.04277 -0.404682 -0.46914 -0.122487 -0.527964 -0.415434 0.353458 -0.765661 2.408137 0.295856 0.333294 1.543456 1.513972 2.042004 1.874818 -0.462333 -0.002595 -0.906028 2.17242 -1.109326 -0.739201 -0.19232 0.011073 -0.222998 -0.236818 -1.558602 -1.374665 -1.329979 -1.429535 0.326955 -1.093488 0.686816 0.607514 0.160124 1.848096 -0.989719 -0.380487 0.31227 -1.102114 0.900304 -0.222623 -0.954251 -0.959762 0.710211 0.209298 -0.749458 0.788456 2.140845 0.601389 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.97696 1.07705 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.208264 0.833631 -0.029095 0.925536 5.160941 3.493776 4.481702 4.42979 5.006176
"i hope i am doing this write! i never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. i feel better now that i am actually doing this, i thought i wouldn't figure it out in time then i would get a zero and bring my grade down. i am a freshman and i really want to do good. i hope my roommate isn't wandering where i am. we were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at5. i was glad it wasn't raining when i got out because i didn't bring my umbrella. i am kind of upset that i couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one i brought. i don't want to look like a dork. i miss my boyfriend he is in san antonio where i am from. i wish he would've gotten in to ut like me. it would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. my time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that i have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. i not a very fast typer so i hope i have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever i am thinking. well thank god i am almost done i only have one more minute so i have to push the submit button before it cuts me off. bye.

"i am so exhausted. these last few weeks since school has started has worn me out. i have pretty much no energy, and i got ten hours of sleep last night. my brain is also exhausted from all the partying i have been doing since i got here. i can't wait for tonight. i am going to club elements, and i am going be wasted. i love techno music. it is so awesome. it is crazy how a dj can put all sorts of different beats together at once and make it sound so perfect. i could listen to techno music all day long. i am listening to techno music right now. every time i hear techno music it makes me want to dance and have a good time. anyways, i hope texas kicks some ass on saturday. i love watching ut play football and tear it up. college football is the best sport in the world to watch. my other favorite team to watch in college is michigan. my dad went there so i have been a true michigan fan ever since i was little. i even went to the rose bowl in 1997 when they played washington state. they won and michigan ended the season undefeated and number one in the nation. in choosing the college that i wanted to go to, it was a choice between michigan and ut. my brother graduated from ut a few years ago and i really looked up to him greatly as a kid. i finally decided to follow my brother and go to ut. so far i feel it was a great choice. austin is an awesome city that fits well with my personality. i decided that if i want to continue my studies and get a masters degree, then i will probably go to michigan for that. right now, that is my plan for the next seven or eight years of my life. however, i really don't know what exactly i want my major to be. anyways, off of that subject, there are so many fine girls here. everywhere i look there is another girl that i want a piece of. i t is awesome. i have never seen so many hot chicks in my life. the whole experience of living down here so far has been awesome. i can do whatever i want, whenever i want. and it is great living far away from home. nothing beats coming in at five in the morning and not having to hear my mom or dad bitch at me. actually, my parents were very good parents and usually let me have my space. they learned after the first two kids what it is like parenting kids, so they were pretty loose with me. i really do kind off miss my parents. they are very good people who gave me a lot during my stay at home and they would do anything for me. they have always been there for me even when i have been in trouble with authorities and other high officials. not that i was a bad teenager or anything, but i think everyone who likes to party a lot, like me, have had their share of conflict with the cops. anyways, twenty minutes is up, so bye.

"i am so cold right now, and i want to take a really long nap. i have so many things to do and i don't know where to start. i miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. i don't know if i like the whole idea of growing up. sometimes i wish i could be a kid forever. my roommate can sometimes become annoying and i just want to scream. my suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. i really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. the cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. i had the best ice cream the other day at coldstone creamery. it was cake batter flavor. crazy ,huh? i am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. i am now happy to be in the school of education. so many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. but i am glad that i have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what i truly would love to be. i think i need to take a shower. i want to have a family when i am older and i can't wait to get married and have kids. someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. i've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and i hope to build some very good friendships here in college. i tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. i play with my hair a lot and as a result i need to get my hair trimmed. people think it is ridiculous but i have done it since i was a child. i had a conflict with my sister this weekend. i hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. she is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. i think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement"" in college which she did not take advantage off. it's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. i hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on friday. i really need one and hate relying on someone else's. i wish i was able to pay for it but right now i am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. my mom is the greatest mom there ever was. she would do anything for me. anything. i wish that her and my dad were closer though. when i was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. i really hope that i can plan a trip to go on for spring break with my boyfriend. i have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. i wonder if my friend martin from germany is going to email me back. i haven't heard from him in awhile but i think sometimes he behaves in ways that i would not tolerate. i wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. i guess i need to buy a new blade. my little sister is painting her wall with a mural of new york city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but i don't know about that. my mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but i think she should be a little more realistic. i really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where i can actually move around. i really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. i am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes i worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. i really could see us getting married but i guess i should leave that to god, if you know what i mean. i love pizza an ice cream. i wish they weren't so fattening. i need to go kickbox this week. it's not the same here as it is at 24 hour fitness. it's cool though. good exercise. i'm really tired of typing. i got to go tan outside today.

"as i sit here trying to think of something to say, my mind is completely blank. this kind of thing always happens when i am trying to write. i guess the only thing on my mind right now is whether or not i am going to make it at such a big school like ut. i have to walk a lot and the studying is sometimes hard. i am a music major a the time, but i really hate it. i think it is a worthless major. it's too much work for nothing. music majors don't make any money. i think that a big part of going to college is learning how to make money. i guess if i was really devoted to playing the piano money really wouldn't matter to me, but i couldn't see myself sitting on my ass playing the piano the rest of my life. i really want to do something exciting. another thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that i go to school 16 hours a week and i am only getting credit for 12. that's four hours i am not getting credit for. all of which are of course music classes. i only get 3 hours for a 5 hour musicianship class and i only get 1 hour for a 3 hour ensemble class. i really like it here, but i miss my friends back home. i think it is going to be weird seeing them again during thanksgiving and christmas. i want to know how their schools are and if they have been to any good parities or if they have made many friends. one thing about going to ut is that it is hard to make friends here because there are so many people. i have, though, made friends with many people that i live with along with some people in my classes. i went to a pretty cool concert this weekend. i went with some of my friends that are still in high school. i miss hanging out with them. it was like old times again. i went with my old boyfriend and all of his friends. i was the only girl as always but that's what i'm used to. i guess i have to keep my attention on what i am doing here though. so that i can survive through college. i think my mom is going to be mad because i may have maxed out my phone card, but that is kinda off the subject. my mind wanders like that sometimes. tamesha is beating up her cd player. she is sitting next to my cursing at her portable cd player. now she is blowing the dust out of it because she thinks that it might work better if she does that. well my time is up, and just in time too because my mind just went blank again.

"well i guess it'll be good to get this out of the way. let's see what's on my mind. ok i think i need to turn off the tv and maybe turn on a little music. this seems like it could get boring. hmm. maybe that's a bad sign that i think my thoughts are goig to be boring. anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on. much better. well i'm officially pledging phi delt tonight. i'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and i'm pretty excited. i think this is going to be a lot of fun. john's pledging with me and i guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends. this is kind of nice. this is a good way to clear my thoughts up. i've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head. what kind of phrase is that. clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it. ok i can't talk about one thing for very long. wow this time is going pretty fast. it doesn't seem like i've been writing long at all and i'm a quarter of the way done. ok well let's accomplish something productive here. what do i need to do today? i need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight. hmm i wonder what i should do about shoes. i didn't bring my dress shoes i don't think. that's one bad thing about being 8 hours from home. when i remember something that i forgot to bring, or didn't think i would need, there's not much i can do about it. ok what else do i need to do today. its labor day. i like not having class. umm ok think, i need to study chapter 5 in biology. really i need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today. and i need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff. i feel like i always have something to do. it was this way in high school too though so i guess its not that bad. there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but i can't place it. i don't think i've ever heard this song but i know the band. that's not saying much for the band. or maybe it is. either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike. i don't know which it is in this case. maybe a little of both. ok the time is not going as quickly as i thought it was. do i have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm i've talked to my mom today about everything i think i needed to tell her. i paid my stupid parking ticket. there's 40 bucks wasted on me stupidity. i thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on ""reasons not to appeal your ticket"" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason. i love this song. barenaked ladies are a good band. i want to see them in concert again. oh concert. i can't wait for the acl festival coming up. and next weekend i'm going to mexico with the phi delts. oh this is going to be a lot of fun. i'm excited for so many things this semester. i just need to make sure i keep my grades up and everything. i'm sure i will. i don't forsee myself slacking off at all. if i want to get into medical school i need to have the best grades possible. but then i don't know if i really want to go to medical school. i need to talk to an advisor about this stuff. hopefully i can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say. i can't decide if i want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. i think this is a really interesting field but at the same time i feel like its uhhh i lost my train of thought. lets see. i feel like its umm something that too many people do. its over done as a major i guess i don't really know what word to use to describe it. woo! one minute remaining. umm so yeah psychology is really interesting. i'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters. in fact i'm kind of looking forward to it. ok well the times up i guess i'll quit now. that was fun.

"right now i am watching tv. i it kinda hard to type with these nails, i don't think i have had to type a large amount since i got them. the commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. i need to get my nails filled, but i don't think i am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that i can spend my money on. i would be nice if i had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. i just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because i had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. i is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. everything seems so materialistic, but i must admit that i am just as materialistic as anybody else. where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. got that book for my sister. that is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. that must be so hard. it seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. i guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. maybe that is how she and her late husband met. mom's birthday is on friday. i need to get a card for her, and i need to get a card for luis. i can't forget that when i go to the store tonight. hopefully that won't take up too much time, because i have a lot of reading i need to do and write notes over what i read. it is frustrating, because i am always reading and doing homework, yet i constantly seem behind. i guess i have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. that sucks though, because then i will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. it is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. i wish i could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. i hope that someone from health south will call me back, if not i will call again since i just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. i would really like to start working again, especially because i need more hours. well technically i have enough to apply for pt school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. some of then have been there for three years. luis and eli had been there for a year and a half or something like that. well eli isn't working there, because he is starting pt school. i wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in san antonio. i don't think waking up at 6:30 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that i am in school, but i guess i just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. i don't really like not having a job, i like the security of know i have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. of course, i think school would be less stressful without a job, but i know i could handle it if i had one. okay i am at somewhere around 15 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since i typed that. man i haven't been typing too fast, i guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. i should put the stuff i need from the store on a post it. i think i have some stuff written somewhere, i usually have random post its with reminders. i know i have one for the stuff i need to get at home this weekend, but i'm not sure about the store. i'll look after i am done with this. okay what next. i wish i could type as fast what i can think. i forget half of what i am thinking by the time i write down the first thought. one minute left. i wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. maybe i should go to the doctor sometime. it could be what i eat, maybe i am allergic to something, or just not eating right. time's up, i guess this is it.

"when i first heard about our first writing assignment, i figured it would be very difficult because i am used to writing about a specified subject matter. but hopefully i can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how i feel. actually, i think i'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. it was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that i might feel or think. i also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. well, i don't have much of either (self-esteem' self-confidence). hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in austin i will develop these traits. when i first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. i almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' i mean, i knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, i was not able to do it. for example, i hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! so i naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because i wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. but i quickly learned here, that you have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. in fact, the question i probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. so i think i have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. in addition, i would always do everything with my friends. and upon coming to austin, i feel'felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. usually, i'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. so these past few weeks, i did not let myself do that. i very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. this was very rewarding, in that, i don't feel as lost in such a big university, and i'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. this is a characteristic which i will need for my expected major. i'm still not too keen on what exactly i want to do because when i think about it, i want to do'be everything, but when i think about it again i don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! but i think i'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. i'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down that much. but i still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. i don't know if i should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. so i'm really confused about that. hopefully, i will learn more about myself through my college journey at ut.

"the first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. my gawd! now i am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. oh, i guess i will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. now my roommate brandon is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. maybe if i ignore him for long enough, he will go away. my glance has caught the sight of the daily texan. what a lousy newspaper. it is really short, and the best-written articles are from the associated press. that's really pitiful, because the associated press writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. but that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. i see that they (ah, the non-descript ""they"") have created a virus that destroys the aids virus in at least some instances. supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. that brings up the issue of testing on animals. i have mixed feelings about the issue. if only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. and if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. but that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. i saw a twenty-twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. they were so intelligent, and so smart. they were depressed, and so sad. poor babies. why do i call them babies? because that implies that they are poor and innocent. i hate the ""dart"" board in our dorm room. it is not a true dart board, but one of those velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. ""bulls-eye! oh, dang it, it fell off. never mind. "" that is quite typical. i hate studying! the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. i hate to puke! just kidding. it's just that i have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now i am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. needless to say, i could use some improvement in my study habits. and the astronomy is so dry! what up with that, g-dawg in da' house? you ask any g-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what i'm sayin', fool? school tomorrow! i don't even want to think about it, so i won't. church went well today. i played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 9:30 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. oops! thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. no, actually, i usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. i must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. especially since i had to hear three sermons. two is my limit, and three is just too much. now i am singing in my head. i cannot stopping ""playing"" in my head the new version of ""candle in the wind"" that elton john wrote for princess di's funeral. ""it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. "" i believe it has been twenty minutes, so i'm outta here!

"i love college. although it is very hard work at times, you learn a lot about yourself and other people. i enjoy being in austin, although my family lives in fort worth. this is my second year hear and so far i like how things are going. of course there is always bumps on the road, but you learn to get by. sometimes i miss being home with family and friends, especially because my best friend lives in ft. worth. we've been the best of friends for nine years now. it seems like a long time. i have so many memories and i like to dwell in them from time to time. my dog ran away. i just felt like adding that in. i just came home from work and found one of my fish dead in the tank. i don't know what happened, the other two are fine. i just got these goldfish. i guess i bought them because i miss my fish back home. i have six huge goldfish back home. they have been part of our family for almost six years now. they are getting pretty old. one of them is blind, i think, because he keeps bumping in to the aquarium's glass wall. i am enjoying all my classes so far. let's see if i feel that way once testing time comes around. i am a bio major. i love biology. i think it is one of the most interesting subjects around. it is so complex and always changing. i want to go to medical school after i obtain my bio degree. i am kind of worried that i won't be accepted to any medical school. what will i do with a biology degree? i like to do research, so maybe i'll do that. i have done research in diabetes in the past. my grandmother has diabetes. i believe that is one of the reasons that i want to do research on diabetes. she lives in el salvador. it is such a beautiful country and they have the most amazing beaches. i visited my grandmother this past summer. i spend a month there. this country is developing so fast; i didn't even recognize the colony i grew up in. of course there are still some underdeveloped sections, but it seems like it's becoming more industrialized every time i visit. ok, back to medical school. being a doctor is what i have always wanted to be. sometimes i think that there is nothing else i can do. i can't wait to go to medical school and actually work in hospitals. i went to a medical profession high school. we were able to work at different hospitals. we had a fist hand look at part of the medical field. i even got to help in various procedures like suturing, administering medication, giving vaccines. what i enjoyed the most was working in the er. sometimes it is very slow, but there are times when patients are coming in left and right. i was able to help bag a patient who had just had a cardiac infarction. it became pretty stressful at times. afterwards you get a great feeling of satisfaction. i t is a feeling that you have helped someone in a time where they needed help the most. you can never forget that feeling and that is why becoming a doctor is one of the most important things in my life. besides my spiritual life, a relationship with god, and my family and friends, that feeling you get when you help a person in a crucial point is the thing i want the most.

"this is the first time i have ever had an assignment like this before. i have never had to use the internet before, either. i wish that the computer in my room wasn't so difficult to hook up to the ut internet system. i am so tired of going to the same computer store over and over. first, they managed to sell me over one hundred dollars worth of computer equipment that i didn't need. after, that was sorted out, i had problems with the ethernet card. oh well, i will ask my boyfriend to fix it for me. i am so glad that he lives in austin. i am glad that my best friend is my roommate. we always get along and we never fight. it's great because if she wasn't my roommate, then we would have a huge phone bill. so far, everything about ut is as i anticipated. i really didn't believe people when they told me that i would have classes with over two hundred people. that came out to be half true. i only ended up with twenty or so in my english class and about one hundred and fifty in my biology class. my chemistry and psychology class end up in the same room. both are enormous. i didn't even know how to spell psychology until about three days ago. whenever i wrote the word i always looked at the course schedule or at my textbook. books are another problem. the co-op had the wrong listing for my biology book, and i had to go through a huge hassle to get my psych book. i shouldn't be complaining. i really love it here. i love being one in fifty thousand. i love being known as only a social security number. the atmosphere is so relaxed and go with the flow.

"honestly, right now that i have this assignment all i can think about is what to write about. i wonder and wonder what i'm thinking but all i can think about is that i want to get this done because if i don't i will eventually get behind and then i;ll never catch up and everyone will be able to go out and have fun while i sit at home and do my computer assignments for this class. i guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what i am and am not doing. i sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments i need to do and all the things i have to do but i never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute. i am so scared that i am going to fail now that i am here because i don;'t quite think that i belong hwere. everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and i am the black sheep. it scares me that everyone seems to have all of these friends already and i don't i just miss my friends that i had in high school. it is different here, no one is the same and maybe they are and i have just changed. i wonder how long it will take for me to fit in like everyone else seems to. my roommate and i have been friends since like the second grade, so i didn't get to meet anyone new when i moved into the dorm. it scares me to even be in the dorm because i am more homesick than i ever would have imagined being. i miss my parents and my friends and my pets and my room. i only live 30 miles away but i worry that i will look pathetic if i go home all the time, but i so much want to pack m7y stuff up every few days walk a mile and a half to my car on the side of the road and head back to hutto. there is absolutely nothing special there, but i miss it so much. my parents say come home anytime you want but do they feel ashamed when i do as if they didn't raise me well enough to make it on my owm. i also feel bad because i don't have a jobn yet, i have never gone without a job, i've continuously had a job for the past two years and now my parents are paying my way and is that fair, they shoudln;'t ghave to i'm a bigt girl i should be paying for my own things, this isn't fair to them. i feel so dependent on them aned all through high school i felt so dependent and now that i should even more, i don't at all. i don;t even know why i chose this school, i think it is becuase everyone thought that i couldn't and i wanted to prove them wrong but that syhouldn't of veen the reason. i am happy tht i am here now because i think it is a good school but i didn't have good reasons when i applied and i worry that will effect my future here. i feel lonely being here. my friends are at other schools in austin and i still have some in hutto but i feel like i am here all by myself and no one sees me as good enough to be freinds with. i feel like everyone already has their groups and i just don't fit into them. today is the best that i habe felt in a long time becausr my friend bonnie is coming by from st edward's and her being here might make me feel like i have someone. i don't know why her being here would do that, but just maybe it might. every time i sit outside i see people being picked up to go do things and i jsut sit outside by myself smoking my marlboros wondering when i will have someone coming to pick me uyp,. maybe that will mak e me look important but why do i care what these people think, even when they see me in the hall they don't know who the hell i am anyway, i think i want them to though. maybe then i would feel as if i was a part of the university. right now i feel like a blacksheep and i have never in my life felt like that. is there a reason why these people look at me odd, why do they not make efforts to speak to me or why do i not make efforts to speak to them. i guess i have a fear of them not accepting me therefore i don't even make the effort to approach them. is the chance of rejection worth the effort on my part. but then again maybe they want send me signs of rejection, maybe they will see that maybe i am a good person and then i would fit in, but what are the chances of that happening. (i feel so dumb writing this becuase i don't say what i feel ever. my mother thinks that i am like in the fact that instead of being honest and admitting how i feel, i create a front and never say what makes me happy, sad, angry, etc. instead i act like i don't care either way and go home or whereever noone is at and cry in private. if no one sees me cry then no one knows how to push my buttons and if you never let anyone in then you never get hurt. only one of my really close friends knows that i do this, but that could lead to me only having one really good friend. but i don't think so becuae i love my friends and they love me no matter what so if they really knew who i was then they wouldn't care. it wouild probably be a relief to them becuase then they wuold know that i was human. not that they think i'm, not but i don't show feelings so they wonder what i am really thinking, but if i tell people whta i really think then i open myself up way too much for dissappointment. i don;'t know what to do, i htink that is why i haven't gone home because if i am stuck here with all my feelings then eventually i will have to open up and let people in and if i run home every other day, i will have too much security and i will think that i can remain closed to new things forever. this way i am forced to accept myself and that way i can find out if people accept me.

"" i have made attempts to talk to new people on campus, whether i'm sitting on the bus with someone i have never met or waiting in the hallway with another student for my next class to begin. i mean i want to meet many new faces but then again i am worried that the people i approach don't want to be approached by a complete stranger. i don't know but i need to figure something out so i can enjoy every little bit of my college experience. hey? wasn't there suppose to be a timer at the top of the screen? oh no i didn't bother checking what time i started to type!well it doesn't seem like 20 minutes just yet so ill keep typing about something. well, lately i have been having doubts about whether to change my major or not. i am currently a mechanical engineer major but have been thinking about switching to computer science. i feel like i will have an easier time in computer science because i find it more interesting. geez!!!!! my arm is staring to hurt from all this typing and my fingers are all worn out. i knew i should have taken that keyboarding class in middle school so i would learn to type properly and not with the same index fingers. lately my mind has been full of worries and things that i need to do before deadlines. this morning i went to the austin municipal court to turn in my defensive driving certificate and they didn't accept it because i need to pay off the balance of my citation first. now where am i going to get $137 right now? my books left me with an empty wallet and i have at least 2 weeks to come up with that money. i think i'm just going to have to sell some of my valued belongings and maybe even donate plasma again. yup! i have donated blood before and have received money for it and i told myself it would be my first and last time to do it. but it doesn't seem like its going to be that way! so i think its been 20 minutes now because i only had 45 minutes of log on time and i was just informed that i have 25 minutes left so yeah. .

"i have done this assignment three times in the past ten minutes and the computer has changed screens when i was looking t the keyboard, so i apologize if you have received several copies of this assignment already- in case you haven't i will write everything i have written already because it is what i am mostly thinking about - firstly though, my roommate is in the next tv room and listening to the tv very loudly with apparently no regard for the fact that i am doing homework- the volume on the television is stopping me from having any complete thoughts which i suppose is ideal for your purposes but quite irritating to me- i have always disliked stream of consciousness writing especially since we read virginia woolfe last year in my english class- we were given a similar assignment and i was told that i could not complete the assignment to my teacher's specifications, mostly because i think more clearly that i speak in most circumstances and even then i have to rework the thoughts over and over in my head before i feel they are strong to enter into an argument. i greatly enjoy debating, and i have never been accused of making a completely outlandish argument before( unless that was my goal in the first place, which falls under a different train of though so i won't mention that here) but my brother and father would argue constantly as i was growing up and the insults and reasons behind those insults that be passed back and forth would be unorthodox and so deprived of reason that i made it my goal not to speak, especially in a debate, unless i was sure that my argument could not be beaten by any irrational statement-i mean rational statement i would let the irrational statements defeat themselves- my favorite aspect of debate would actually be --this all gets back to a time when we were assigned to write a bill that we would take to a fake model united nations conference and we would have to present a bill that we wanted passed- in fact, my partner and i rarely wanted the bills we proposed to be passed, but we just wanted people to have to argue against them, in most cases we would try to make our bills interesting or at least darkly satirical, so that the only arguments that could be made against them would be based on moral rationalization rather than common reason- the moral debates would most likely get everyone interested and could be defeated by one who was willing not to be moral- none of our bills ever passed-as i write this i find that i am often losing my train of thought but i don't believe that that is how i usually think- as a result of the confines of this experiment i am discovering that i am thinking more quickly than i normally do and i can't explain why that is other to keep typing, however, when i am normally thinking, i still try to think slowly and articulately so as not to speak something that makes me look ignorant-this is said mostly to point to out possible flaws in the ways of tracing thoughts . now in fact i a running out of things to say-before i finish, which is still about seven minutes away- i'd like to apologize for the many spelling errors that are sure to be found in his assignment- don't mean the errors that are natural such as words that i just don't know the spelling of but rather, i mean the words that look as if they have been written by an idiot because i am not a very talented typist and my fingers are slipping over the keys, i would go back and fix these errors but that seems contradictory to the nature of the assignment 2:53 that was the time at which i am writing this i am also realizing that occasionally there is no clear and concise thought n my head which i can write down or there are just so many thoughts that i an not possibly transfer them onto paper at the rate at which they are passing through- i hate leaving the impression with anyone that i am ignorant and i think that is the main reason i dislike this assignment, because i don't see how anyone can read this and not see exactly that- it is my hope that at least everyone will appear ignorant and then at least i will be on even ground - i also hate writing this to a professor of psychology because i am sure it is analyzed more than is necessary- if this assignment is done honestly then you could probably jut talk to someone and get just as many honest answers- well -i've just hit nineteen minutes and i suppose that last sentence is just a good a place to finish off as any where.

"right now i'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. how can i find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. well i guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. that sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. which is i am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. this gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. so far since school started i have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. i have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. i want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in new york. now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. i got a girl that i'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. is it possible that i can expect our relationship to work out? i know i want it to, i know i want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something i can manage. are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. it just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. then i start wondering about my best friend who went to arizona and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. i miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because i feel i don't act like my true self around new people. i am not trying to be fake with anyone, but i can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and i don't like that. i just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because i would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. even though i got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that i spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences.

"right now i'm sitting here at my brothers house. i'm very tired and wish i was in my bed. we had a tri-delt meeting tonight and i'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. it just seems like their is something everyday. i wish i could just do some stuff and not all of it. i hate other people having control over me and telling how i have to spend my afternoon. i just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. maybe i shouldn't have joined a sorority. oh well! i just need a break everything is happening so fast and i'm having second thoughts about the whole tri-delt thing because i really don't know anybody yet. maybe once i start to meet people i feel more comfortable. i'm very excited because my dad is coming to austin thurs-sunday. he is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. i haven't talked to my dad in awhile so i can't wait to see him. i guess i'm a little homesick or at least more than i let show. i just worry that i'm the only one feeling this way and i don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. but i don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. she is not interested in the same stuff i am and just sits around and plays on the computer. well enough about that. i'm really hungry but i don't want to eat anything because i worry about gaining the freshman 15. all my roommate eats is fat fat fat. so their is all kinds of junk food in my room and i get tempted to eat it. she isn't worried about her weight. i very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. she is real nice and i was surprised that she asked me to live with her. i said yes but i will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. last night was the weirdest thing i set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. this was the first time that i had the chance since i've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. i even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that i was with them. it was just two months ago. i wish i was back their right now because i had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. well it has been 20 min. so i guess i'll let you go. got to go study!!!!!

"three weeks ago i started out on an unforgettable journey through college. although i have been preparing myself for this journey for what feels like forever, i don't think that one could ever be completely prepared for the adventures that lie waiting for them at the university of texas. my school year started with a hectic and stressful week many people affectionately call rush. the name ""rush"" cannot even begin to describe the event that should be called ""stampede"". i can only imagine what hundreds of girls running around the ut campus in nice dresses and make up in the heat of august would look like to an innocent bystander that just happened to be on campus that day. with all of that over and behind me i thought that i could calm down for the start of school and get ready for the classes that were ahead of me. boy was i wrong. i don't think that i have had time to sit down long enough to think since i have been here. my classes move so fast and the stress of walking from class to class without getting run over or getting lost is enough to make anyone go crazy. but, with every 15second brake that i get i have to sit back and enjoy the college experience that i am having. sure i am busy, but the main reason i came to u. t. was to get out of my boring hometown and in to the always out of control city i now call home. i love it here and i can't imagine looking back on my college years with memories coming from any other place but austin.

"sometimes i wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, i guess living in general. what is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. i wonder if that was his plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. in a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. as a follower of the times, my faith in him has also declined as the years have gone on. well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. as i entered high school, i was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. but i realized that life is only as big as you make it. if you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. but back to my point. i made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as i've moved to the next step in my life. my five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that i knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. don't get me wrong, i am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but i don't think that i realized what i was losing. my best friend with whom i spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. i didn't realize how much i would miss him until he left. when i see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. my girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. i knew leaving her would be most difficult, but i underestimated the pain. i miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. i feel like i don't know her as well as i used to and i wonder if i ever will. the leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. i guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, i don't know. anyhow, i wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. but for now, i guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive!

"sitting to write this assignment, i feel i have lots of other things to think about. when will i find time to get everything done? i still need to unpack boxes, get things organized. the days pass, and more is left unfinished. i thought i was off to a good start, but i need to find a way to organize myself so that i can meet daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. my problem with procrastination is always adding unnecessary stress to my life, and if i could only stay on top of things, or work a little more each day, i would feel less stressed, with a better sense of accomplishment. what do i want to get done? i want to finish unpacking, decorate my room that requires that tickytacky stuff, since nothing sticks on these stupid walls. need to find more little pillows, and little desk and drawer organizers. little stuff like that. i need to organize my pictures, decide which i want to hang up, which are best in frames, where i will display all my frames. i also have to decide which stuff i really don't need, and pack that up, and ship it home to california. i need to organize my school stuff, still buy my aerobic book, and the right edition of the odyssey for that freshman seminar, plus get some three ring binders. i know i brought some, but have no idea where they are at the moment. it seems impossible to loose something in such a small space, but i've managed to do it quite a few times. i need to balance my checkbook, pay my cell phone bill, and call my bank about my debit card that is not working. did i not activate it right? i know i have enough money in the bank. i don't understand what the problem is. i have to remember to get cash; i have borrowed money too much from people in the past couple of day, not because i was out of money, but because i kept forgetting to figure out the problem. until i do, i can't get money out of the atm machine, i'd have to go down to the bank, and get money out, or write a check for cash, or something. still trying to figure out all this bank stuff. i wonder if that cell phone bill is right. there seem to be some unnecessary charges on it, or ones i didn't know about. why is my mom not calling me back? i know they are busy with soccer stuff, but i left a message saying i needed to talk, and asked those questions on the answering machine, you would think she would call back immediately. especially since she expressed so much concern recently when she didn't hear from me in only a couple days. i need to get on top of my reading, and studying. want to find a better place to study than my room. too many distractions, my computer, my music, my phone, my ongoing room decorating project, unpacking, the tv, email, the neighbors, the stupid smoke detector, that is low on batteries, and is constantly, constantly beeping, relentlessly. and the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor, it is so annoying, between the beeping, and banging, they are enough to drive my absolutely insane. i went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping, it is so shrill, it's painful, especially terrible when you're trying to sleep. my roommate doesn't seem to mind, she can block out almost anything. i don't know how she devotes so much time to studying. i wish i could be more disciplined like that. i would be much happier with myself. but, i am having so much fun. will study later tonight at barnes and noble's with amy. we'll see how that place is for studying. it's hard not having my car, although most people have theirs. it's nice not to be the responsible driver, and to have to pay for gas parking, or worry about getting lost, the ridiculous one way streets, and no road signs hardly to help you out, but still at times it would be much easier if i had it here. next year, i will but what car will i have? what are my parents going to decide about that? what about molly? what will she drive? will i get my prelude? will that be too hard on my parents? how are they handling sorority costs? should i get a job soon, to help with all that? how are my bills going to be this month? i'm sure the long distance bill on my regular phone line will be out of control. try to use my cell phone more, free long distance, but not sure exactly how long i have the extra minutes for. will john go by my parents' house tonight and set up his ticket? it makes me really nervous, not quite sure why. i know he want to come, and i know he's planning on it, but i want to see him so bad, and miss him so much, i don't want to get my hopes up too high, in case things don't work out. how will things be when he comes, how will be people like him?. will they be accepting of him? what about the whole tattoo thing and the way he dresses? i want him to bring all his long sleeved shirts and nice clothes, but i do not not want him to change for anyone, nor do i want him to change. i love him exactly the way he is, and wish there were more people like that here, but i don't want him to be uncomfortable, or other people to judge him or make him feel uncomfortable. i want everyone to like him and for him to have a good experience. even though i know he's not coming to go to a bunch of parties, or meet a bunch of people, he'll be here to spend time with me, but i still want to take him out, take him to the game, show him how big and fun, and cool the parties are here. definitely won't be going to any sigep functions, i know how they are about outsider guys, especially someone like john. i could never be embarrassed of him, but it might be uncomfortable, especially if any guys give him a hard time, and then i'll feel like i brought someone who wasn't supposed to be there, like with sean the other day. that was a really bad experience. i don't want anyone to make john feel that way. having a car would be nice for when he comes, could pick him up from the airport, take him to cool places, the oasis, the lake, mt. whatever where the zeta girls ate tonight. there are so many pretty, cool things, three days is not nearly enough. but, the time will be spent well, and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him, or make it harder, because he'll be fresh in my mind. they say out of sight, out of mind, and i believe that to be very true. same went for mike. but, the longer i'm away, the less i think about john, and the less i truly miss him. i think the same goes for him. it doesn't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when i first was here. but of course that should be expected and it was. i don't like the way some things are here. i want to get out and meet some different kinds of people, or meet nonfrat type boys, because i'm not liking the conservative style that much. it's not what i 'm used to. i definitely don't like how money and status are such an issue. it's ridiculous, it reminds me of the movies. i didn't think people like that really existed. i left california thinking i was getting away from all the selfabsorbed, selfimage, stuff, that i was really growing sick of, only to come somewhere and feel as though i'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery, based on money, family name, status, having not really anything to do with how good looking you are, as is the california snob, but how much money your dad makes, or what kind of car you drive, or whether or not you buy an $800 shirt to wear to a frat party. it's all very ridiculous to me, and it makes me sad, and homesick for a place where it's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time, and where you're not judged by how much money you have. i do love how the boys always hold open doors for you, and pay for everything; those are aspects i do very much enjoy. i would not want to raise my kids here, i'm not even sure now if i want to live here after college. i love a lot of things about it, and i 'm having so much fun, meeting lots of wonderful girls, the guys are a problem for me. i went to college thinking that it's funny knowing this is probably the place where i'll meet my husband. i highly doubt it at this point in time. i'd have to find a diamond in the ruff, like becca did. it makes me miss john, karl, daniel, jordan, ryan, even so much more. it makes me miss all my guy friends, and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite, but funny and perverted, to a certain point of course. i can't wait to see john, i wonder how things will be. i've decided to tell him how i really feel, knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way. i think he probably has an idea of the way i feel, i've probably hinted at it before. i do have a glimmer of hope, since he's been signing his letters with the word love, and wrote, ""love, john on the picture he drew, and he is spending at least $300 to come out and see me, which unlike all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make, doing countless hours of work, and now is throwing it all into a three day trip. it really is incredible to me. it touches me to think he would do something like that for me. i wonder what daniel and karl think about that, especially daniel. what about jordan, i wonder if mike will find out. what will he think about that? he once said, regarding the necklace and earrings from daniel, that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever. well, he knows john never ever has any money, never has a steady job, and mooches off of everyone else. how would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me? maybe then he would open his eyes a little. probably not though. i hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport, i know candace won't want to miss any of her classes, for him of course i could, it doesn't look like i have any test or quizzes that thursday or friday. i do have a psychology test the day after he leaves. how will it be when he leaves? i wonder if i'll be really depressed. probably, i'm probably making it harder on myself. probably harder on both of us.

"ok. so i am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing i don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although i don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, i have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when i sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. i'm hungry. but i don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, i can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that i am hungry now. i want to eat now. maybe something small when i get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. i can wait. i guess. i wonder if they think its cheap that i'm inviting them over on monday. this way i order the cheap monday madness pizza. but i guess its not really a big deal. i was going to invite them over soon. i want my computer up and running asap. i can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. i hope bilal and them come tomorrow. i mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. i smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, i guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. i mean, lots of people do smoke, but i just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. i don't think i was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was i? oh well. that's what i'm doing. haha i can't believe i was so stupid today. i have been going to urdu class at 12 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if i had gotten there right on time, i would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing i went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! i really didn't think that she would let me sign in. i came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, i have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. i have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. i guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. i don't think i have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as i had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. i like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and i'm upset with raza. i didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. i don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. i'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like i have been typing for twenty minutes straight. i guess this wasn't so bad after all. i wonder what happens after my time is up. will i not be able to type anything else? well, i will find out in 40 seconds. now after this, i got to pick up my i'd from the business school, then. then i dunno. i could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or i could go home and study"". but that will never work. hmm, i think i just answered my own question.

" i guess i will talk about the guy i was dating before i came here, since i just got off the phone with him before i got on the computer to complete this assignment. after dating him for two months i realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. there are no straight rules to follow. everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. at first i was so confused by this guy because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. after just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. i think that is weird. i guess i will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. i still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but i am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. i had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. i was thinking i could never do that. i think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. because i believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and i are not together. i thinki'm still new to the dating thing because i don't understand it. i try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. i have mostly dated older people. my first real boyfriend was seven years older than i. that relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than i was. his majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. i think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. after breaking up with him i felt i needed a boyfriend and i even felt a little lonely. now i am fine and mostly dated for fun i guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. i gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others i find attractive or of high standing and what i don't want my future husband to have one day. not to say i am definitly marrying someone but i hope i will find that right someone. for right now though i am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before i ever get married i want to have finished school for my own personal goal. you can't always rely on others in life so if i get a good education i can get a good job to support myself. this has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. because that someone else might not always be there. this has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. i hope i fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what i was thinking about. i feel confused by relationships and i guess i should be and i am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. i just hope everything will work in the long run and so i'll try not to worry about because i used to worry about things to much that i would stress my self out.

"ever since this assignment was introduced in class, i've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). it's just that when i sit down at the computer to type something, i usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. never have i just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. i guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because i find it so hard to express myself at times. the other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, ""that's you!"" i guess i had never really thought about that label applying to me. but once you started listing examples, i had an epiphany. i guess i am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. i like everything neat, clean, and orderly. i can't stand having a dirty living space. i mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? for me, it's just not possible. plus, i think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. i like to make good first impressions and the way i maintain my room is a way of achieving that. i think i get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. i remember one time i started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because i wasn't washing the dishes ""the right way. "" of course i can't really complain because i do a lot of that too. i understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but i just like to do things my way because i see the logic in it. a lot of my friends think i'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if i wasn't, i can't even imagine what my life would be like. being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. it is something that will never change. i guess i shouldn't say that because every time i say i will never do something, i end up doing it later on. for example, when i was younger, i told my older sister i would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. so i guess that's why i should never say never. i have so much to do today. i probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. of course i had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing jeopardy online with my boyfriend. i've always loved playing intellectual games. it makes me feel great when i can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. it amazes me the things i remember from some of my classes in high school. and sometimes, that information came from classes that i thought were totally useless at that time. now, i realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe calculus when you're studying to be a communications major).

"i don't know what just happened, but all that i just wrote for the last 10 minutes just got erased. this makes me a little perturbed, but i don't really care. this just allows me to write even more interesting things. maybe this time i'll talk about movies. yeah those bad ass little things that i l0ove ohhhhh sooo much. in fact i'm hoping to film a movie by this years oklahoma game. that way i can show my best friend who will join us from k. c. together we made 6 movies. 4 movies for english and two for our own enjoyment. okay the preview for scream2 is on the tv behind me and its a little hard to pay attention to this assignment, but i guess this is also part of the assignment. how many people does it take to rip off a football from the bumper a of a frog. jello. jello. retard. bug women can kick my friend's ass. at least that is what he always says. he says that he is going to start going after those women who could actually kick his ass. me i'm just going after the beautiful intelligent type. it seems like it is working out thus far, but not from m shoes. 4 women are in my life right now. one is an ex-girlfriend who i was very attracted to, but broke up with me for seemingly no reason whatsoever. i think it was because i became too attached, whatever that means. i guess loving someone too much is not a good thing. that was sarcasm. i really don't think there is such thing as loving someone too much. i do sometimes watch myself when i'm trying to meet a girl. now i wonder if they think i'm trying too hard. anyway, my ex gave me a call and we talked for 2 hours. in the talk i felt like going over there and hugging her right there, but she would be missing out on sleep for her next day. i think she valued her sleep more than me. well no not really, i think we just weren't mature enough to know how we really felt. i still can't really say whether it was true love since i have never had any other taste of love that i could compare it to. al i know is that i miss what we had, and i want it back. i thought i was over it. he's 30. i am over it. today i realized that life is not as complicated as we all make it out to be. it this ""real world"" that we have made up that keeps us under constant stress. the mind analyzes everything and tries to figure out the real world. it is the heart that i try to follow. the heart gets past all that which seems and goes straight to what feels right. i believe in that feeling over the appearance of a situation. i have led a very happy life and i think i am doing things right. i jus t recently had to decide whether or not i wanted to be a frat guy. isn't it funny that i brought this up right after i mentioned i think i'm doing things right. i take that as a good sign. but now i'm hesitating so i take that as a bad sign. basically i'm still trying to figure out whether i turned down the frat for personal reason or to please other people. when i did decide to quit the frat i became extremely happy, almost to the point of crying in my car. this was when i came up with this decision on my own outside the influence of the other people i know. then the damn frat got me to come into their house and talk to me one on one. this showed me all the people that i would be letting down by not joining the frat. i can't stand letting people down. i try so hard to help everyone, but its just impossible. i think the reason i felt like an asshole yesterday was because i have let a lot of people down the beginning of this year. namely the frat and my brother for not joining the frat like he did. he is trying to live vicariously through me and it is a little annoying. i think i first showed interest in the frat just for his sake. i would like to explain to my brother that we are not alike and that my whole life is not revolved around women and beer, but anytime you talk to m brother he just makes you look stupid and i hate that. i don't feel like i can explain anything to him unless he already believed it to begin with. i think this is why he became a lawyer.

"i don't like icebreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. i won a huge pack of icebreaker's gum from pro grad and i now feel obligated to make use of it even though i dislike it. i do that a lot. i eat foods that i don't really like just to make my mom happy. it is not really a big deal. i usually tell people what i like and what i dislike, but sometimes i don't. my grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and i don't like coconut, but i use to eat it anyway. one day i just stopped and she didn't really notice. i was like, ""man i could have stopped a long time ago, but instead i didn't. "" okay that makes no sense, but i do not always make sense. my mind jumps from thing to thing, and i digress a lot. i get off track often. love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. to me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. i cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. i can get deep and all emotional when i feel the moment calls for it, but right now i am just not really in a ""deep"" mood. i still have to read my chemistry and read my cyberreader for my cyberpunk class. why am i taking a cyberpunk class? i have no idea. i like to try and experience new things so i decided to take it. actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. i love to be happy. i hate to be sick. i love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when i am sick. the water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. i don't want to do my reading assignments. i want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. i want to go see ""the cell"" with jennifer lopez and vince vaughn. i can be such a teenager sometimes. i do some of the most immature and silly things. i can fall all over myself when i see a cute boy band, and i can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. clay walker, a country singer, has a song called ""ordinary people"". it is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. it talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. the great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. i can't imagine being photographed all the time. i don't look good in photos when i am posing, so you can only imagine how awful i would look in ones where i do not pose. i sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. you all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that i have selfconfidence issues. i can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. i like being short. i like that people view me as cute just because i am short. being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. i just like the idea of the guy being tall. my boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because i look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason i think that makes us look cuter. why do they call the prestage room the green room? the green room is often not even green. i don't understand that. i don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. except of course for in way west texas where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. i hate people who are hypocrites. i think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. i wish i was smarter. i wish i could sing. that would be a great talent just because i like to sing. two minutes to go! i can't help but look at the clock. i am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages i have to read. i am very impatient, but i am patient when i feel it is necessary. times out! the end!

"i have a horrible headache and i don't want to read for my other classes. my mind keeps wandering off into the conversations on the television. my head itches, so i am going to scratch it. i thing i am going to enjoy the business council . i am glad that i got on it i need to be on a organization. i wan to go to cancun this spring break but my boyfriend wants me to meet his family in chicago. i really would rather go to the beach. i am listening to the television again, even though it's in the other room, and i hate guys who date strippers and then they tell the girls to get out of it. hey if you liked her as a stripper before then you need to like her the way she is. i am upset that i am missed the mtv music awards because i love music, if i could anything i wanted to i would quite school and pursue a career in the music business, even though it is so saturated. i just noticed that victoria's secret is having a huge sale on pajamas, i could really use some. i am noticing that my mind is shifting every direction. it is difficult to write about nothing and stay on a particular topic. if you gave me something to write about i would be able to concentrate, or maybe i just don't realize that my mind wanders so much. isn't it like every three seconds. oh this weekend was so cool i went to a foam party and i had a blast. i was up to my face in foam last night. i have never been to one of those before in my life. i probably would go again too. because everyone was really mellow and just having a good time. do do, i am now singing a song in my head and kind of dancing. i was fascinated at dinner today because my roommate's father was telling all about his experiences with scorpions when her was a boy. i was pretty freaked out the whole way home. i kept feeling like something was crawling all over me. it was weird. i am so bored now, you said to be honest so sorry. i want to go shopping for some new winter clothes that always feels really good, i get so excited when i buy stuff and i look good. well i need to workout first because i have become a little bit more flabby than i would like to be. my eyes are going blurry maybe i need glasses or else i am really tired.

"i haven't been in the mood to do any homework. i find it very hard just to sit down and study. as a freshmen, i have found many new experiences in the past week. finally getting my email hooked up, i received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. my good friend from home wrote me from south west. she informed me of great news. she is having a ball at her new school. she is on the drill team, and making many new friends. which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). as i came home from church, i was excited to see that i had two messages all for me! :) the first one is from a friend who attends ut. the other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in wacol. we could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. however, it was long enough so i could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. which leads me to the point that i am feeling terribly lonely. i don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but i am envious. see, i came to ut because i didn't want to go to a&m because my brother went there. ut and a&m were the only two schools which i applied. truthfully, i am not too excited about coming here. however, i don't want to go to a&m. it's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. anyway, so i moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. so i have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home! i am always here all by myself. i have a total of four friends up here. one of which, heather, i spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. she knows how to get under my skin. however, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. which leads to the final three. lindsey goes to st. edwards, and is so homesick. she misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. katie is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and sandra. sandra i've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. you see her and lindsey are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which i am takes lindsey's side. my reasoning was because i thought sandra was inconsiderate of others needs. you see, i had every single class with her our sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. so back to the present. i don't really know anybody, and i am bad at meeting people because i don't know what to say. don't think i'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but i just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. which leaves me very lonely. it's mainly my fault because i don't want to spend much time with heather because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. katie, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except i don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) lindsey, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. and sandra, who called me yesterday just to talk. now how nice is that? i mean, i went to sandra's today before class, and i had fun. she's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. ) which i guess why i used to have bad feelings towards her. she's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but i kind of want to meet my own friends. i group of new friends. also, lindsey the homesick one made friends too. which is good, because she needs to be happy. however, i think it is about time for me to make some friends. well, also i tried out for the ballet class here. it sucks! i'm so mad. there are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. i was stuck in the freshmen class. it is so bad. i've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. not to mention there is no pointe here! i am not trying to sound smug, because i was far from being the best at my studio at home. but these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. don't get me wrong, i was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to ""place our arm on the barre"" i almost died. i know where to put it. i don't need help with that. i need help with my turnout, extension, balance! not with were to put my arm on the barre! well, as you can see i am not excactly a happy camper. i'm glad i wrote this, it was fun. my fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but i'm sure i need to get used to that. well, i'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. it's peter and the wolf. we've done it before. it's going to be cute. i was the duck, my friend sarah(who goes to south west) was the bird. she was a great dancer. she was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the nutcracker(not clara, but the dew drop) she shared it with elizabeth who dance the cat. elizabeth is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. she was going to go to oklahoma on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. my other good friend is ginny, she's a sophomore. she is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. so those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. i love ballet, we also have this one dancer named vanessa, she has extension to die for. that means her leg goes all the way to her ear. she is great. i love ballet, that makes me so happy. well, thanks for this assignment, i'll see you in class, but i doubt you'll see me! i'll probably drop by you office sometime! i hope this makes since!

"i am so ready to go home and see my family and friends. i have never really ever been by myself for this long. it would not be so bad if i had at least one familiar face around but i really don't. i am trying to get to know my roommates better but i guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years. in my small town we will be friends forever but here i am not so sure. i really hope i can get involved with the church here. i think that will help a whole lot. i want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole ""lets get drunk at every social event"" really bugs me. why can't people just have good clean fun? i love the team and the school but i can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! anyway i am looking forward to seeing the familiar. i love it here and am gload i came but i am looking forward to next weekend. i am really ready to see aron and my other friends. this has been the longest we have been separated. i pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever. i love him so much. we can talk about anything. it is great. we share so many things in common. he loves god and that means the most to me. it is a real balanced relationship. wow i cannot believe it has only been 7 minutes. it feels like an eternity. i have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes. i am kind of nervous aout my classes. my major is spanish and i am not so good at it yet. hopefully it will come with more practice. wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great. i cannot wait. i am so ready to be around people and meet people. i want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances. it is kind of lonely with just saying ""hi how are you?"" and then nothing past that. o well. i hope i am doing well in school. i don't just want to be here, i want to thrive here. i want to be the best that i can be with everything i do. i want to be proud of myself and i want others to be proud. i like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests. but then again, if i mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up. i am shooting for a's but one or two b's would not be awful. but i am studying for a's. i need to start working out. i have been sick though but i need to start again. maybe someone might like to go with me. it is always better with someone else. i am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. i also wish josh was here, it would be so much easier. hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. he is like a brother to me and will always be. i really miss him. hopefully he will call back but i guess i will just call him again. well these are all the things i have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. i think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 16 minutes. i wish all writing assignments were this easy. i need to sign up for more experiments so i don't get behind. i also need to do some passoffs. hopefully if i study them well today i can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 12 left. that would be good. i wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. i love my little town. i would not trade it for the world. those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as i do but they will some day. i am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. i like it that i live here cause my dad visits a lot. my family is awesome. they do so much for me and i thank god i have them. you know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. what is this world coming to? i am so voting for bush!

"well, to begin with i am simply thinking that i don't think i can type for 20 minutes without my fingers cramping up. but that is ok i suppose since i doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students, i don't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts. confusion is a funny thing. it comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often. at least i think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often. even when you know exactly what to do, sometimes you can get confused because you don't want to do what you are supposed to. sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. (in a manner of speaking) i am thinking that i am tired of writing about confusion. it's kind of like thinking about thinking. i heard that it is bad for you to do that. i think it destroys brain cells. but then again, a lot of things destroy brain cells. drugs destroy brain cells. i don't do drugs because i don't think i have very many brain cells to spare. wow, only 5 minutes have passed! that is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and i don't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and i am taking no chances with that kind of stuff. i know how sneaky teachers can be. i know how sneaky students can be. some chick was all cheating on out math quiz today. i don't know who she was, but she was just flipping through her notes. the teacher had no clue. he was too busy daydreaming. i could have cheated also, but i don't like to cheat. i think that if my best isn't good enough for the professors at ut, then too bad, i'll go to community college. i would rather have a degree from acc that i earned than one from ut that i cheated my way to getting. i think most people would agree with me but who knows! i tend to think that people are good. but that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once. take for instance my good friend tiffany. yes, good ol' tiffany. i loved her to death. we were really good friends. we did everything together. then one day i found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend, john. that was quite a shock to me. i was so depressed. i didn't even want to get out of bed. i did, but it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do. i was really very in love with him and i thought that he was in love with me too. i guess that is just one example of how stupid i am. so i guess i learned from my experience. people aren't as good as you would want them to be. but then again maybe i didn't learn jack. because the next guy i went out with was a jerk too. well, he actually was a decent guy. at least that is what i said to everyone when they told me he was a ""player"". oh gosh i still have 7 more minutes. well anyways, they told me he was a player but he said that he thought i was the most beautiful person he had ever met, inside and out. that was it, i was hooked. that is all i have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that i was special. he made me feel pretty and he told me i had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person. i loved hearing him say that. i was willing to risk everything. i even compromised my friendship with my roomate. see, she said they were just friends, and so did he, but then when him and i went out for the first time, she was very pist off. i didn't know why, but it became a suspicion of mine that she secretly liked him. i asked her about it, and she denied it. but i still to this day do not know what to think about her liking him. i mean, she did encourage me an unususal amount to break up with him. not that it would do her any good because he really would never go out with her. but still, i wonder sometimes if she ever did like him. she is a strong willed person and i thought that she would just come clean and admit it if she did. but the thing about strong people is that most of the time they are often weak. they are just good actors and can hide it better than the rest of us. i think all humans can have the same amount of strenghth. i think that if you just pretend to be strong, then everyone will think you are strong. it is from this facade that you can draw strenght. take for instance omar. i act like i don't care about him at all when really i still care for him a lot. now, since everyone thinks i am strong i just pretend that i don't care about him and it helps me to deal with it when we are around each other. i guess i kind of slipped the other day when i got drunk and called him on the telephone at 4:00 in the morning. hey, i hope nobody reads this because this is some embarassing stuff and i really don't think that anyone should know about my loser life except for me and the power macintosh. ok well i am pretty much done now. i guess that wasn't so hard after all. i hope the next assignment is this easy. not that my hands aren't going to cramp up when i finally press submit. ok, i'm done.

"i just finished working out. it was pretty tiring. i haven't worked out in awhile. it's kind of cold in the room right now. i'm always cold. i dont' really know why. it's kind of weird. i miss freddy so much. gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. it's good that i can see and talk to him, but everytime i do see and talk to him, i just get sad. i want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least i'll see him at thanksgiving. that will give me something to work forward to. hmmm. my sister's husband is here for the weekend. it's still really weird. i can't imagine my sister married. it's quite strange. but she seems happy, so it's good. i feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than i am though. kind of makes me feel bad. but i'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. i'm going to work really hard this sememster. i have nothing else to do really. i can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. with is kind of poopy. because i actually get along better with guys. but it's ok, because he can't do anything either. i was going to write something and i just forgot what. i do that a lot. i'll like so upstairs or something and then i'll forget why i went upstairs. yeah, it's pretty strange. hmm. the tv is going on in the background. it's a pretty funny show. i need to go to the bathroom. i just drank a lot of water. but i still have like 15 minutes left on the clock. wow. 20 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. i'm not homesick at all. i knew i probably wouldn't be. i've always been the independent type. pipit is a pretty good roommmate. we dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so i don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. she's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. i'm always on the webcam, so i guess its' good that she goes out or i think she'd be really annoyed. i havent' really met anyone new yet. i guess going ot ut does that to you. you stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. plus, it's weird. even when i'm hanging out with friends or something, i'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. man, i'm such a nerd. haha, oh well. i think calculus will be my hardest class. i hate math. ugh, at least i will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. but it's like simple math. so i'll be ok. at least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. i tend to do that a lot too. i always look at the time. even though i pretend not to. i still do out of the corner of my time. it's like i try to trick myself. but it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. a lot of people are gone for the church retreat. i dunno. i kind of of wanted to go, because i didn't go last year, but i'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. i feel like all they do is judge you. the pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. yeah, i think it's pretty dumb. it's makes me really mad sometimes. they have no right to judge. my spiritual life is between me and god and no one else. uughh. yeah, but i think i'm going ot find a new church when i go back from college. that will be good for me i think. steven is iming my sister right now. i still feel kind of bad for him. they went out for like 3-4 years and then my sister marries someone else. but it's for the better. they fought like everyday and he would always cry. so that's not too healthy either. i miss my doggies too. dusty babulee chen and even mocha. awww. my dusty. i want him here to keep me company. i think dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. because i know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. he's so old already. it's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. that's going to be one sad day. i had a bad dream last night. freddy dream-cheated on me. man, that sucked. i was sooo mad when i woke up. i must be really insecure or something. this is the second time i've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. hahaha. that's pretty funny. it kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. with a passion too. it's pretty bad. but freddy has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. rex is like a brother and i think of him as a girl too. i wonder if he knows? he should. people always make fun of him about it. but maybe he just think we're kidding or something. hmmm. maybe we should tell him. dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. i don't think i exactly have the right technique. i wish i still played piano like before. i want to relearn the chopin song. maybe i will. . if i motivate myself to. that would be really good. that music class is pretty simple though. i hope these 3 months until thanksgiving so really really fast. i cant' wait to see freddy. man, i think about him a lot.

"at first when i came to ut i was really scared that i was not going to make any friends. right away i met many people and made many acquaintances. i am not sure i have made any really good friends. i feel lonely many of the times even though i am constantly around different people. for me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. first of all, i have no family near me which removes that area of love. my best friend, milan, is one who i can turn to. or so i thought. he seemed to have become distant from me than usual and i did not appreciate it. actually it made me jealous because i need attention. so then i began to think that i might like him more than a friend. one of my good friends ended up telling him that i like him. it made things worse than before. but now he likes me and still wants to date other people. i think i really like him so this bugs me. i don't know what i should tell him. i think that he does not like me the way i like him. he told me he was going to come over today but he did not. he did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. he is probably out, clubbing or something. it was rude of him to not even give me a call. situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. i feel like some how i am always betrayed. why is that? i wish i could be happy in my life. that is all that i ask for and wish for in my life. i feel like nothing really makes me happy. i am not saying i am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. i am just saying that sometimes i am sad and maybe sometimes i am content with my life. content is not good enough for me. i want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. i am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. why is that? why me? i ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. i think that in life i will never really be successful or anything because i get lonely really easily. i can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. i need someone to go with me. is that a bad thing? i think that it is because i am not very independent. i want to have someone with me all the time because i like the company. my best friend also tells me that i crave attention. i don't know about all that. maybe i do though, who knows? school is stressful for me. there is so much studying to do and i feel like i have no time to do it. there is time though but i don't like to be alone. and to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. i guess i just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. hopefully all will work out best.

"i am sitting in my dorm room right now and i just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because i don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on tv. i was so stressed out earlier today because i can not hack it in my calc. class. i went to class though only to affirm what i had previously believed. yeah right. i used to think i was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that i am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. simply for the fact that math is required. i am actually happier though because now i have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. i like that. i like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. i am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. i also added rtf 305 to my schedule. i am so excited for it. people annoy the crap out of me. sometimes i wish i could just crawl into a box and never come out. call me a crab but i don't really care. i am what i am. i feel chubby right now. i want to eat but then i don't. i know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when i don't truly want it. wasters never want. . . good quote. very true. i have come so far in my life. i can't believe i am finally at college. . on my own. there are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways i am lucky. it is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. that is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. falling short of the glory of god. it is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. i lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and i also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! i will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. i can't believe i used to sell knives this summer. seems like 3 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. one day, i hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. i would pay good money for that. i am sure every woman in the u. s. would do the same. i bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. i tan too often but i do like the feeling and i am not going to stop.

"i have at least forty- thousand different things i have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me for one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated second, i have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that i haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, i feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, i went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so i go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but i forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so i had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as i said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but becky, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that so i get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so i gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so i still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses) its not that big of a deal its just that i really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well i guess he can fedex the stuff up to me that way i'll get a package, that is really cool since i don't get any mail anymore. oh and i haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now i'm using my roommates computer which i have to say is a lot easier to use than mine i've had a total of i think 4 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's ""really good"" at fixing this sort of problem also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer oh well i guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and i guess they prepared me for it i guess that's why i don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead i prefer just to charge it to my parents i just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now i'm totally kidding i have a monthly allowance now and i'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right? overall, i am enjoying college i just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school i was really involved in different organizations and i was in all ap classes so i did get stressed quite easily i've been meeting a lot of new people of whom i love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so i'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them ",1,-0.159665 -1.001761 -0.325563 -1.038427 -1.379828 0.353852 0.294384 0.286837 0.463472 -0.011088 0.664896 0.844174 -0.272973 -0.351013 0.362651 0.0 -0.04277 0.103513 0.30247 -0.072688 0.299555 -0.742368 -0.363739 0.468063 -0.624052 -0.490487 0.776836 0.335715 -1.53281 -0.916406 -0.390192 -0.390668 -1.216603 -0.066088 -0.732423 -0.350745 -2.149728 -0.4452 -1.610153 -1.520456 -0.464565 -0.126934 1.147404 -1.499396 -0.456145 -1.007201 -0.785202 0.044259 -0.732333 -0.50661 0.178118 -0.772101 0.371125 -0.965079 -1.272052 -0.551375 -0.490328 -0.954251 0.260176 -0.080664 -0.181264 -0.077437 -0.480161 -0.331923 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.968611 -0.271958 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.329212 -0.37208 0.096053 0.281882 -0.146784 0.468634 -0.136926 -1.462858 4.989742 3.993724 4.75345 5.043107 4.560903
"i met this guy mark thursday and today we had breakfast together. i really like him, but i don't know how to express myself around him. i get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. i have a nervous tick in my stomach when i think of him, like now. i feel like calling or emailing him, but i can't find the guts to. at breakfast, it took my five minutes before i could stop shaking. no one noticed but i could feel my knees quiver. school is not exactly what i thought it would be. there is so much reading, and i don't know if i'm absorbing it all into my brain. so many fun things to do, i make myself sit and read. i try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. i try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but i suffer as much failure as i do success. i have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and i'm lucky if i get the times and meeting places correct. i guess that's why i bought a cool ut planner which i carry with me everywhere! my mom was the same way i am. she procrastinated more in college than i am and did very well. i don't want to fail. i think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and i zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. i miss the familiar faces and places of port lavaca. i miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. tears come to my eyes. i haven't cried in a very long time, not even when i came back from the long labor day weekend. when i talk on the phone with my parents i swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. i want to succeed here and i'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. as a little girl, i came to many ut football games. my dream was to be a student here. considering i was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. i love the university and i'm glad i choose ut over southwest texas. southwest does have the best speech pathology program in the state, but i can not see myself anywhere, but here. when i think of that the sadness goes away, but i'm still left with an incredible amount of work that i am trying to accomplish. my dad works very hard. he only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. i can't tell if he likes work. he almost hates his sister's husband. i don't like him either. a total jerk and i feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. i think my dad is happy. he always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. he loved it. he was an average student in high school, most likely had add or adhd. we've always been close, but sometimes i feel like he disregards my feelings. we're both athletic, but i got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and i, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. i hope he knows i love him very much.

"stream of consciousness. somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's ""a light in august"" we read that nnovel in my senior ap english class and although iit was a touch on the boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. well i'm in my dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. i. e: when i'm trying to take a nap. our refrigerator is in the closet. it was in the middle of the room, but my roommate moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. my roommate's name is ricky and he's been out of town this weekend as far as i can tell. he kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his family. i think he's from laredo, but i could be mistaken. ricky is dating a girl named natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. because it smells like crap! which sucks, because it's a really expensive dolce and gabbana or however you spell it. it really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to everything in our room. especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like him. oh i hate it. i always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that his designer cologne smells like ass and that i could make the scent personally with some onions and curry. god! i've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of weeks, but haven't exactly found one. well i found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at what the times are for mass or whatever. my dad is really pushing me to start going to church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a jesus freak. he's not bad, but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. for instance, i joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it simply because he doesn't like fraternities. but he doesn't exactly say why. and since he's never been in one i don't see how he can make such a judgement. oh well, my dad and i went camping this weekend. we like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a place called reimer's ranch. so we found a new camp site called krause springs and it was really nice. so we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever. but me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that i took the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the ground. it was pretty bad, but i made it through. only got about 3 and a half hours of sleep though. ughh. oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed to reimer's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. but we didn't give up hope and went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got to do one route because it started to rain. so after that our hopes were pretty much shot so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and i took a nap that i just woke up from about 20 minutes ago. so my weekend was pretty lackluster but it'll be ok because i know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. oh well. my mom just called me a second ago and i was like, ""can i call you right back? i'm doing a project"" and she's so understanding and just said ""bye"" really quick so after i'm done with this thingy i'll call her back. i've actually been keeping in touch with my mom pretty well since i moved here which has been nicer than i imagined it would. i expected it to be annoying talking to her too much but i was mistaken. i've also been talking to my sister via email which has been fun. she's so funny and always has something to say, but whenever i call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and i just ask for mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. i know it's weird, but the thing i miss the most about home is my dog. i have a full-blooded springer spaniel named lola and she's such an awesome dog. i miss her so much, but i'm hoping that if i live in a frat house next year i can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. oh well, i guess we'll see ",1,-1.217185 -0.721188 -0.24141 -0.40483 -1.269578 0.722758 -0.304706 0.147435 -0.185518 0.791682 -0.105885 -0.303522 -0.455205 -0.942956 -0.219048 0.0 -0.04277 -0.124621 -1.399712 1.948964 -0.951965 -0.38686 0.740788 -0.866502 -0.211902 0.605791 -0.480026 -0.077757 -0.562616 -0.336189 -1.100231 -0.37768 -0.435312 -0.906028 -0.150654 -0.533287 -0.66599 0.941092 -1.370034 0.173732 -0.166731 -0.67468 -0.188506 1.130197 -0.197606 2.116769 -0.625286 0.972341 1.808338 1.024291 -1.153971 -0.231111 1.978865 -1.881208 -0.399159 0.646244 -0.056456 -0.466871 1.150931 0.328682 0.731011 -0.675108 1.244208 -0.745201 0.3896 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.598038 -0.258316 0.038109 0.403382 -0.396256 0.058861 -0.17263 1.181849 0.850657 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.170182 4.445822 3.362122 4.92609 4.449144 4.99667
"as i look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 12:26am on september 11. i am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago. they still should strike a painful memory in every americans life. i remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment. i also feel a little stress with all of the homework that college brings along with it. austin is so much different than my hometown of lubbock, and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it. however, i have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far. i cannot wait to say that i am a graduate of the university of texas. that will mean so much to me and my family, since it will be an amazing accomplishment. i just remembered that my laundry basket is full, and i need to do that sometime before friday since i may be leaving town for a pat green concert. hopefully, the laundry room at the end of my floor, 6th in jester west, will not be full. surely i can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that i did not complete. i sure hope i can adjust to college as well as i have set my goals. my roommates are out of the room right now, and i am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here. they are both from lubbock also, and i have been friends with them for about 6 years. my parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much i appreciate them paying for me to come down here. i know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence, but me and them know it is for the best. i am convinced that the business program at ut will set me up for a very successful life. my hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously, and my eyes are starting to close. i feel like falling asleep, but i know how much work i still have left to do. for some reason, i get most of my work done around or after midnight. it helps that i don't have a class until 10 on mwf and 12 on tth. i am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church. it is important to me to find a church in austin and not forget the ways from which i was raised. many people believe ut is so liberal that every student comes out weird, but i believe there is something for everyone in austin. i have already met so many people just like me, and it is awesome. by far i can tell that college will be the best time of my life. the only thing i wish i could change is the dorm food. i am getting so tired of chicken every meal. i do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken. well the saying goes, everything tastes like chicken anyways. maybe next year i can get an apartment with some of the new people that i meet and possibly the guys from lubbock too. i am trying to figure out why my email is not working. it keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying. oh well, two more days to the weekend. arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game. i saw some of the football players today. wow, they are so huge. they are like a different breed of people. i want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big. i know it is some sort of phenomenon or something. i figured out that in 2 minutes i have to find something new to do so i am already brainstorming. i wish every paper was this easy. english papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind. it could go on forever. i never have to stop and think. dell: what an amazing company. how does someone without a college education make so much money? i hope my college education will lead me to success like that. well, time is up.

"right now, i am feeling a little tired, a little overwhelmed, excited, and also a little afraid. i am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise. i am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that i have found myself in in the last couple of weeks. its not really that i am overloaded with work (yet), it is just that i am still getting used to everything here: new and different classes, new ways of studying and testing, new teachers and techniques of teaching, etc. i am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings: a new room, roommate, sleeping schedule, eating schedule, etc. i am excited because i think i am going to enjoy living and going to school here. i am excited about taking courses that i'm actually interested in, and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing. i am excited about meeting new people. one of the things that i enjoy most about austin is the diversity of the people you can find here. no matter what kind of person you are, you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns. i have already met some very fascinating people. austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the university. if i'm not mistaken, it is the music capitol of the world. i could go on for a long time about all the reasons why i am excited. i am afraid mainly for the same reasons that i am overwhelmed. mostly i am afraid that i do not know how to take notes and study properly. i find myself looking at others people's notes during lecture to see if i am writing down the important things and whether or not i am getting the point. my mom says that in time, i will learn what to write down, read, and study. i have never been a very good test taker. my biggest fear of all is the fact that i have always relied on the one on one attention that i received from my teachers in the past to get me through school. now that i am attending the largest university in the county, i know that that is impractical. however, i plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids. with an average of 540 students in your classes, i know that you cannot offer that same oneonone environment. that is my greatest concern.

"right now i feel somewhat tired and weak because of work last night. i'm also feeling a little upset because the eagles destroyed the cowboys 4114 to. and to top it off we lost joey galloway, our best receiver. also troy aikman had another concussion and who knows what will happen next. but on a more serious note i'm a little worried about college. i guess i feel like i have a lot of weight on my shoulders, because i want to prove to my family and to myself that i can make it. school has always come pretty easy to me, but this is college and it worries me. i think once i get the first test out of the way i will be fine. at least i hope i will be fine! i'm also having mixed feelings because i quit my job in order to have ample time for college. things just weren't mixing right so i had i discussed it with my family we decided it was best for me to hold out on working until i got in the grind of college. life has been pretty good lately it's hard to get a schedule with so many things going on. each day is a whole new adventure. some troubles i ran into with college so far were finding a parking place and having to walk ten minutes to my classes. one good thing that has happened though is i have really good classes and professors. i also have people looking out for me and i have made some new friends. ut is like a whole new country there are so many people, places, and things to do. i'm beginning to understand college life. when i first applied to ut i had no idea that it would be like this. i never expected it to be so big and beautiful. everywhere you walk there is something new to see. every building is huge and has something that sets it apart from the others. i guess ut is blown out of proportion with me because i come from a small town of 5000 people. it was a city where the most popular people won everything. but here at ut it doesn't matter who you are. it's like everybody starts over. everybody is giving a clean slate. it's a great chance to prove myself to the people around me, my family, and me.

"well i finally got into this computer. i have been waiting in line for a while and i'm really not sure what to say on this assignment. my mind is going crazy because i really don't know how to use these computers but i did figure it out. i think i might have sent an empty page or two to you because i wasn't sure that i didn't have to press enter when i was through typing my name and social security number. i shouldn't have left this to be done for the last minute. this assignment is due today by 5 p. m. and i hope that they go through to you. i really don't know that much about computers but they sure are smart. well the person who programmed these computers are smart. i hope i do well in this class because i would like to have a good grade point average when i finish school. there are only three people in my family that have gone to college and this includes me. i really want to show my parents that i can do well on my own and be ( i just forgot what i was going to say sorry!) i can't think of the word right at this moment but it will eventually come to me. i'm not really sure if this is what you want me to be writing but i will try my best to tell you what i am thinking. i am confused right now because i am thinking of many things that i have to do. i am behind in one class and that is philosophy. i can't really comprehend what philosophers are saying. to me, i think some of the things they say are pointless, but hey that's just what i think. last night i was trying to catch up on my reading but i can't really understand things when i can barely read what they have to say. i guess i have to read it a few times before i really understand what they are trying to say. it's like they never come to a point until a few hours later. my back hurts, not that you wanted to know that but that's what i'm thinking. i am trying my hardest this year trying not to procrastinate as much as i used to in highschool but highschool is different. i am running out of things to say and i am just typing empty words on the screen because my time is going so slow. i have about ten more minutes. i will tell you what i am doing this weekend and about my apartment complex. when my roommate and i moved into our apartments we had a few problems with management and our ""home"". first we were supposed to get our apartment fully furnished but some things were missing and management decided not to tell us until we had to ask them. we were missing a couch and a few chairs. i really didn't mind about that because as long as i had a bed to sleep in i was fine. but my roommate finds any little thing to gripe about. it's like she has to have something to argue about and someone to argue with, which is usually with me because i am the only one there. i do not know how her boyfriend can put up with her. i think i am going to live alone next year if things keep going the way they are going. anyway, back to the apartment, our water was not working we had no telephone and a few things were wrong also but now that they are working i could care less about them. i am so tired, i haven't been awake this early in a long time. well my twenty minutes are up and i hope this is what you wanted. i should of asked questions but i am too shy or maybe embarrassed to go up to one of you to ask. i think it's shyness more than embarrassment. good-bye!!

"ok, i guess i really don't know where to start. i just got out of my ba101 class, which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began. i guess maybe i should have stayed longer, but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open, and trying to make friends with everyone around them, that i couldn't stand it for very much longer. this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though i'm writing all of this on one very long line, i'm wondering if there is some way i can go about fixing it after this is all over, because it is really annoying and it seems as though i'm not writing anything. i don't know what i'm going to do tonight, it's too late to call my boyfriend, he lives overseas, and there is a seven hour time change. i hope everything is going well with him, because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it. if only i was still in france that way i would know that everything was going well with him. this is a really huge box that i'm writing in because the wrap around just came into affect. very strange, very very strange. i guess i'm at a point where i don't exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank. my friend once told me that he never stops thinking, that at all times he is thinking about something, and when you are talking to him, that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with him. that worries me, because sometimes i see i'm smile for no apparent reason when we are talking, and i just know that the last thirty words that i have just said, he is paying absolutely no attention to. my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds, that's not saying that i'm not. but my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in. maybe that's why i'm taking psych instead of sociology, it's because i'm trying to figure out who these people are and why i chose them as my friends. it could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat i've recently gotten into. my boyfriend is really into existentialism, and so the only thing i've been reading as of late has been kundera and sartre. but then of course i must be honest, i'm taking this course because it is located close to my other class on tuesday thursday, and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well. not to mention my friends who have taken soc, told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take. i hope i get a good grade in this class, after this last semester, my grades are suffering, i literally dropped my gpa by . 4 over this last summer semester, which should indicate that i really didn't do very well. but i only have 35 hours, so if i do well this semester, i can bring my gpa back up over 3. 5 and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again. it's not like they aren't nice now, but they are ""really disappointed how i handled last semester"" that is ""considering that we sent you to france last you, you could at least try a little harder"" this would all be said in the james earl jones low god-like voice that i always get in my head whenever my dad is yelling at me. i probably get that in my head, because my dad yelling at me reminds me of darth vader when he's mad at the corporals, and james earl jones is the voice of darth vader, do you see the connection? anyway, so i'm trying to make my grades appear somewhat better, because if i do, they will probably let me go on the intensive french study program i want to go to next summer. and then i can see my boyfriend he is so cute. i miss him a lot. i tend to think about him most when i'm either lonely or bored in class. that only either maker me more distracted from the work i should be doing, or even sadder about being all alone. if only he could be american, my life would be so much simpler. have i been writing for twenty minutes yet, i swear i've been writing for decades, and my hands are starting to get lazy, and tired, and i really don't want all these people around me in the computer room, and i wish that i had had the time to take a shower this morning, because i think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell. i have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now, because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving, granted they were here before i even started this little assignment, into the mind of the student at the university of texas. i'm starting to think i'm going to end this pretty soon, because that is the only thing i can think of right now, is when am i going to end this assignment. i think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant. but you said that it didn't matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes. so here i am my twenty minutes complete, and i am saying good bye and thank god this is over. only one more to go.

"ok, so i'm sick and i don't feel good. but i feel better than yesterday and last night. i woke up about a million times last night feeling horrible and my temperature just kept climbing. i finally took some tylenol at about 4am this morning and i woke up later sweating, so i hope that means i broke the fever. now i just have this stupid cough to worry about. i hate coughing because it hurts my throat. i need to call my voice teacher and tell her i can't come to lessons today because i'm sick. which sucks because i haven't had a lesson in forever. and she's the best teacher i've ever had. i guess keeping the extra money is good. ugh. i'm coughing again. it sucks. my dog is looking out the window. i have a lot of studying that i need to do today. i need to catch up on a bunch of stuff so that i hopefully can go to dallas tomorrow to see sister hazel in concert again. but i seriously don't know if i'll be able to go since i'm sick. i'm on medicine, so hopefully getting another round in me today will help. goodness this stupid clock is going so slow. i've only been typing for 4 minutes. i think 20 minutes is a bit excessive. there's not even a pause button. what is i have to go to the bathroom or someone comes to the door. seriously. plus, i want to lay down. i want to get something to eat and take my medicine. i need to call my voice teacher. so, i want to go to dallas this weekend but i also want to stay to go to some stuff that's going on down here. mostly because the guy i have a crush on will be there too. and he's been giving me very mixed signals lately. which is so frustrating. i don't know what to think or how to act around him. i'm trying to act almost aloof, as if i don't care. part of me thinks he's just toying with me to stoke his own ego. and i refuse to play into anyone's ego. i don't want to get hurt. it sucks. and this cooler weather is reminding me of couples. being able to snuggle and all that. not that i've ever had that. i'm 22 and i've never had a boyfriend. which is ok. i don't define my self worth by a guy or if i've had a boyfriend or not. but sometimes i do think it world be nice. but it's whatever god has planned for me. if he thinks i'm not ready, then i'm not ready. i need to start spending more time with god. just get my focus back on him. so many things have happened these past few weeks and i feel that they've all been for a reason. and i'm graduating in december and i have no idea what i'm going to do. i'm excited and terrified at the same time. will i get a job? where will it be? will i like it? will i actually get to end up doing what i want to do? why am i so scared to put myself out there sometimes? the worst that can be said to me is no. there are always other options. if you want something, you've got to spend that time and effort it takes to make it happen. so i just called to cancel my voice lessons and my voice teacher is going to charge me for this week anyways because its a ""late cancellation.

"well i'm supposed to write and i don't really know what to say. i'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch tv. i wasn't doing anything productive so i thought i'd get this writing assignment out of the way. do typos matter? because i keep erasing, but i don't think it really matters. ok i left one in. so it's really hot in here. and my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. but oh well. i'm waiting for the cartoon home movies, to come on. i don't usually watch cartoons, but i saw this one once and it's really funny and i liked it a lot. wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. i think i'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. i'm so sick of studying. my roommate is talking about a little girl in a missy elliot video. what song is this? i have no idea. i'm hungry, but i can't eat and type at the same time. my side itches. hold on a second. aw there we go. much better. so i don't understand why i have so much work to do in my english class. it's ridiculous! it's making me so frustrated. my other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! i have to read 22 chapters in jane eyre by tuesday. oh i like this song. probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because i'm trying to type, but it's ok. i seem to be doing ok with it on so far. i'm really tired and i wish i could just go to sleep but i need to study some more before i do. i have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. wow, i complain a lot. i don't mean to, but i do. ok. running out of things to say. talk about smells. can't smell much. it's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. damn! only 8 minutes have passed! twenty minutes feels like forever. we did a stream of consciousness paper in creative writing in high school and i remember how much my hand hurt while i was doing it. i need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. and from driving from college station (no i wasn't at a&m) to san antonio and then to austin today. that could do it to you! well i want a pretzel. they're sitting right next to me but i can't get them. when is this thing going to over with? i wonder what you learn from this? how weird and random people are? i think i'm a pretty random person. i used to say that word a lot in middle school. i hated middle school so much. i don't know why. it was just horrible for the most part. and high school wasn't much better. i like college a lot more than both already. well my show should be coming on soon. i can't wait to watch it. i hope it's a funny episode! i always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's not funny and think i'm stupid. not that i care, but i want people to know that it's a really funny show. i need to be studying for english. no, not english, music. english just popped into my head. hmm. ok only 6 more minutes. i think i can handle this. wow, it got quiet in here. and really really hot too! at first our a'c was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. and now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. katie just discovered longhorn delivery. i love that thing! i used to use it all the time when i used to come visit friends in austin. we were all pretty lazy. i'm becoming less lazy here i think. i have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. i want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. i'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since i left. my parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. i think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. i hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. i've been warned it's almost 11:30 and home movies will be on shortly! i'm excited. i think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! well my time is almost up and i'm glad. oops, i hit the caps lock for a little bit. ok 10 seconds. and i'm done!

"you can't tell a person to write their feelings and expect that to show their thought processes. the awareness of the exercise takes away the naturalness of thought and the process of transcribing one's thoughts is inexact anyway. well, i'm having difficulty doing it anyway. my apartment sucks. it's so modern. the clubhouse is littered with ""artistic"" wrought-iron chairs and bright paint and triangular windows and shit. there's nothing artistic about that-- it means nothing to the creator and it's just used to entice ""hip"" college kids to waste their money on these glossed-over crack house apartments. i'm not too upset about it though. i'm used to that sort of thing from corporate entities. the hard thing about these exercises is the difficulty of knowing the audience. it's not to the professor or the ta or my classmates or even to me because, i'm thinking it, why do i need to tell it to myself? i write this and click the submit button and it travels into some ethereal world where it is represented to the prof ' ta ' whoever as an affirmative for social security number 465953267. maybe that makes this more ' less daring. i don't have to worry about you(whoever you are) reading it, and more importantly about myself going back and reading it tomorrow or in a week or a month or whenever. it makes it more daring because i can write anything and as soon as i click submit, it vanishes as far as anyone is concerned. less daring in that i risk nothing. i'm wondering about the symbolic value of that word submit. i submit my thoughts. earlier i was thinking about something. it was a little fragment of a story about existentialism in a borgesian dream format. maybe i'll develop that now. i dreamt last night that i was a mercenary in far away world where i had no vested interest in the goings-on. the denizens of said world were warring over things of grave importance. i posed the following question to myself: ""if i were to care about a side which would it be?"" and so i picked a side and started fighting. without fervor, without life-and-death importance, but with respect and a little curiosity. not too bad. i'm not much of a writer. i guess as 20 minutes pass one begins to get used to the audience and just write. i'm out of ammo.

"today is a bad day. my boyfriend and i of 2 years just broke up because he is at another university and is rushing right now. i have always been the center of his world and now he acts like he doesn't even want to talk to when except for when it is convenient for him. his roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me and when i first heard that i got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the restroom. jared, has been the ony guy that i have ever loved and i thought i would marry him. we spend holidays together and i am already a part of his family and he is part of mine. to think of him being with someone else just kills me and i am so torn up right now that i cannot concentrate on anything but him. i had to end it because i cannot continue to be hurt when all i have done is devote my whole life to him. he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had together. my thoughts are horrible right now and i never thought that i could feel so hurt and ashamed. my biggest fear is that he won't even care because he will just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other girls. jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he was always worried about me forgetting about him. he was always the one that couldn't stand not to see me for one day, and he was so in love with me tat sometimes i got annoyed by it. now the tables have completely turned because i feel like i am incapable of functioning without him. for the past 2 years, everything has been about him and so now i just don't know what to do with my time. where do i even start without him there to say i love you at night , or without him there when i am having a bad day? this is the worse feeling i have ever felt and i just wish he knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day! he will probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks. i helped him move into his new apartment and was not invited to come since, but all of our friends have gone over there and seen him, so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that position? i have not been real happy lately as it is because i just transferred to ut and i hate it so far. i don't see anybody i know during the day and i feel so lonely without jared, and now it will be permanent. this is the worse time for this to happen and it makes me feel sick when i think about how it probably won't change. we have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now there is nothing perfect about us and all i feel is pain. he is going to the school that i did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while i have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what i get for it! i kept telling myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about him every day. i am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help me during down times like this, but they have never seen me like the way i am today. i have seen other people hurt this bad and i just thought to myself that it must suck to be like that and now here i am in their shoes. he is the guy that has always put a smile on my face, made me feel loved and made me a better person. i go to sleep at night thinking of him and i wake up in the morning thinking of him. we have had problems before and after a few days he couldn't stand fighting with me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad. i keep telling myself that if we don't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me, but i have such a bad feeling that this time is different and he will just move on. i don't want to move on but i have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people because when i think about it too much, it tears my heart up. this is the guy that i have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has already given me up. we have all the same friends and i will not be able to hear about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until i start t feel better. i have no energy and it scars me because i don't even want ot do my homework of study because my mind is in such a different place right now. he has put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting people. it just kills me to think that i am here and he is there without me because i have always been included in everything he does. now all of a sudden i am shut out and i hope he realizes that he can't live without me. it is so hard for me to think of him with somebody else because i know everything about him and what he likes and does not and i don't ever want another girl to be that close to him. i love jared so much and i wish he wouldn't have ever left or that i would have stayed there because things could be different right now, but he enjoys making me jealous when he talks about all the things he is getting to do. i know that i must just live day to day knowing that things will get better but right now i can't see myself getting over this for a long long time. i feel worthless today, am i am a very good person so what did i do to deserve this? i am just hoping and praying that things can be patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is like without each other. i just don't want him to throw everything away, because he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. i talked to him this morning and all i could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as i do. i am only wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if i will ever be on his mind because i usually know what he is doing all the time. i am supposed to be the one who goes to these parties with him and i am supposed to be with him when he meets other poeple so they know that i am his girl and now all these girls that have been in love with him while we have been together are going to love that we have broken up. i am going on and on about how upset i am its just very hard because i had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being without him. and as for school, i hope it gets better it will just take some adjustments. i hope jared still loves me as much as he always has!

"annoyance is about the only word i can think of at this moment to describe how i feel. today has been awful. why doesn't anything ever work out the way i wish it would? everything i needed to accomplish today has been a filure> i can't find a job because i can't get on a computer because me uteid is all out of wack. i miss my friends back home and i miss being a part of my family. they just seem to go on so wonderfully without me. i guess i am the one who wanted to move out and be independent, but it'd be nice to know they all still care about me and are concerned with how i'm doing. it's so hard being so alone all the time. i wish i were making more friends. i wish i would join an organization or i wish i had rushed. maybe life would be more fun if i were in a sorority. maybe i just wasn't cut out for college. i want to be grown up and finished with college and heve my career so badly. i'm tired of just meandering around with no real purposee in my life. i want to start my real life, and i know this can't be it because i'm not happy with it. i want to fall in love and marry and have a family and a meaningful job. i just needsome meaning in my life. i don't know what i'm here for. i know what i want to do with my life, but time is getting in my way and i'm angry because of it. and i'm hungry; physically and metaphorically speaking. this cannot be the way college will be forever. it's so much worse thatn high school. it's so big. it intimidates me to think that there are more poeple on the ut campus thatn live in my home town. i have a class that has twice as many pople than i graduated with in it. it's a real shock. it's traumatizing to go from being well known and well loved to not being either one at all. it hurts deep down and is extremely depressing and discouraging. but i shouldn't let it get me down, i should hang on to the confidence i've still got, because it's the only thing that can get me through ""the best years of my life"". yeah, right.

"i am sitting at my kitchen table right now and i am really frustrated. i am trying to write an english paper and it is so bad. i think i am so stupid sometimes. it really frustrates me when i can't do something perfect. i am also feeling kind of lonely today. i wish i was living at hardin house because that is where all my friends live. they all seem to be making so many new friends and i just don't feel that way. i am loving college in some ways and in other ways i hate it. i really want a boyfriend. alot of my friends have been asked to all these pledge lines and i just haven't. am i ugly? am i fat? sometimes i just want to know what exactly in wrong with me. i am tired of drinking. everybody in austin is an alcoholic. it makes me feel terrible and lazy. it is fun for a while and then the next day you feel like crap. my roommates still aren't back yet from san antonio. what's wrong? my other roommate is getting in the shower. i wonder why. i wonder why bobby piper hasn't called me. he was my date a few nights ago. he was such a gentleman. i don't think we could ever date though. i am not a very good dancer. i get real nervous when i am on the dance floor. my friends from arkansas left today. i didn't go out with them last night. i read my friends paper and she was talking about how drunk she was at the time. it kind of shocked me. it was kind of funny though. i think it gives me more self-esteem when guys like me. is that horrible? diet coke is so gross. why am i drinking one right now? should i call my brother? his girlfriend is so awesome. she is one of my favorite people in the entire world. i love my brother too but he gets drunk too much. i hope he doesn't become an alcoholic. i wish people would come see me. i get kind of lonely sometimes or maybe it is that i don't want to be doing my work right now. i kind of like homework though because when i am done i get a feeling of accomplishment. that is also why i like to run. because when i am done i get a feeling of accomplishment. i am really nervous about my english paper. i don't think it is very good. i am going to rewrite it now since i gave been rambling for twenty minutes. i need to pray. i wonder if god is always listening. oh well, i'll stop now.

"right now, i'm thinking about my physics lab and the fact that i did really poorly on that lab. i need to maintain a good gpa in order for me to get into the business school, and i don't want my lab grade to impede my admission. but even if i do get into the business school, do i really want to do something in that field? i mean i didn't declare a major at first because i didn't want to commit myself too soon to a field of study. i've always been interested in music. i do want to major in that but my parents aren't that fond of the field. so either i double major, which is impossible in the business school, or i don't do what i really want to do--that is major in music. no matter what i major in, i will have to maitain a very good gpa throughout college since i want to study abroad in england--the country where i've always wanted to live. mainly because of the fact that it is home to my favorite sport of all time--cricket. no one really knows about the sport here. i wish a lot more people did know about it so they could relate to the joy that i feel while watching the sport. i guess to enjoy a particular sport, or anything for that matter, u have to be born in that environment. back in pakistan, everyone loves the sport and it's like a religion. i sure do wish that pakistan had won the world cup in june. all that hard work went out the window when they played so poorly in the final. anyway, i hope to become a cricketer myself in the future. but that's not a career that is looked upon as being a good one. and the cricket board in pakistan is really a mess. a lot of good players are neglected because they don't have connections with members of the board. i have a cold and i've been sneezing since all day yesterday. god it's so painful to sneeze 24 hours a day. i took a dayquill last night but even dayquills seem to make me drowsy. now, on top of the sneezing, i have to deal with trying to stay awake in my classes. i'm waiting for my roommate to come so we can go eat. gosh i hate the food in jester. i mean it's the same old stuff everyday. at times like this, i really miss home and my mom's cooking. the weather over here today is pretty good. better than the previous month has been. i want to go play golf but i don't know where any of the golf courses are. i guess i'll ask my roommate's friend who plays golf.

"excersise really does work. it does release happy chemicals. i feel reasonably energized now. but at the same time, i feel like it already peaked. its wearing off. jealousy is funny. chris and harvey met three girls while i was gone. i feel left out. i have a girlfriend, and i love her more than anything. i miss her. id give anything for one of her hugs now. but perhaps just the fact that they are meeting people and i am not is making me jealous. but. if they had met some guy, i don't think i'd be very jealous. its girls. i like girls. girls make good friends. i seem to have more close female friends than most with girlfriends do. i always thought this was a good thing, but lately, given my reaction to this new college environment im begginning to wonder if it is. im begginning to wonder whether i just want to meet girls, and have the romantic tension that will never amount to anything more. the romantic tension makes me feel good about myself. shouldnt my girlfriend make me feel good about myself? she does. but i always want more. it's impossible to do this assignment without sort of planning it out. i want music now. i still feel jealous. but while writing about it, some of it has subsided. i feel guilty for being so jealous of my close friends. in fact, my best friend. my roommate. i don't know if he considers me his best friend. it would flatter me more than anything to find out he did. if he ever told me. if i died, i wonder how many people would say their best friend died? i feel like im a best friend to many people. i feel guilty for this, because best friend usaually implies an exclusive position. now that i think back, there have been many instances where one of my friends would tell another friend that they were my best friend. i considered the friend they told my best friend. and i felt like i had done something wrong, like made the person who wasnt my best friend feel to close to me. i like close friendships, with anybody. i don't like going to parties. i like hanging out in small groups, or just talking to one person for a long time. i think i have made a lot more close friends this way than people that go to parties. i think a lot of people are jealous of me, because i manage to maintain intimate friendships with so many people. its odd how oblivious i am to this jealousy. im constantly insecure. i've questioned repeatedly how anybody could like me. i never want to meet anybody like me, i could see through them to everything i hate about myself. even as i tell myself now that people will jealous of me, im sure something will happen tonight that will make me forget that. when im jealous of someone, i don't understand how they could be jealous of me. i'm constantly jealous. for my freshman seminar on concepts of sin, we have to pick our own sin to write about. my sin will be envy. the one i can't control. other sins don't give me as much trouble. im a very restrained person. i think restraint and balance are more important than anything else. especially in love. i say that because i remember a word my teacher was talking about that meant to love your spouse too much. she said it used to be a sin, but its not anymore. it began with a j. i wish i could remember it. im sure ill look it up soon. its a word that relates to me a lot, and i bet i'll sound very smart when i use it. people will think im a very educated person who not only understands himself, but also uses big words to describe his self understanding. anyway, i agree that loving your spouse too much is a sin. my spouse type figure and me seem to have a mutual understanding about this. its odd how at times i love everything, and at other times i love nothing. i wonder if the aderall i take affects that. it seems to stimulate my emotions. sometimes when i take it late at night so that i can focus on studying, i start crying from pure emotion. heh, well, obviously not pure. harvey aays its okay to take because it was prescribed to me. i still think id feel better about myself if i wasnt on it. this band makes me feel better when im troubled. its odd, because theyre lyrics are very meaningless to me. but the music has this sleazy, yet upbeat sound that somehow taps into what im feeling. i wonder if they created this sound on purpose. i saw them live in austin, it was a fun show. i remember a drunk man who was extremely happy jumping up and down a lot and yelling right next to me. that was the first time i ever wondered if i should start drinking. i think i've still decided no.

"as i am sitting in the computer room at the castillion, i am thinking of how dull and boring this room is. the walls are a dull gray color and i am all by myself. the chairs are scattered unorderly throughout the room. i am now trying to decide about what i should do for this weekend. i told my parents i was leaving here thursday night but i now realized i have a sorority function that night and also on friday. i then thought about leaving friday afternoon, but that would mean missing the ucla game on saturday. i also have a sorority field day on sunday which is not mandatory, so i think i am just going to go home friday night and miss the game saturday and also the field day sunday. my classes this year are overwhelming. i am so swamped with work that i'm worried it will not all get done. when i leave this weekend, i hope to get some studying done considering the castillion is one big party 24 hours a day and it is very difficult to sleep here. i wish people would take others views in mind and be a little more considerate instead of knocking on your door drunk beyond belief at 3:00am on a tuesday night. i am going to eat at subway as soon as i'm finished with this paper because i'm starving and i can't concentrate very well. i have about 7 pages to read in philosophy tonight and about 25 pages in biology. this is such a big difference than in high school when you didn't even have to pick up a book to make an ""a"" in an honors class. i know that some of my friends are going to have a tough time here at ut because their parents were so protective over them and now that they are on their own with 6th street so close, they are going to go crazy. some already have. my roommate here is great. i grew up with her and we get along very well. i am lucky considering there have been several problems with rooming situations in our dorm. the mail situation at this dorm is terrible. my father sent me an overnight package and it didn't arrive until one week later. the food at this dorm is good though. well my time is now up and i am going to go eat, finally.

"so, far college life has been pretty cool. i really enjoy the freedom. i think i have a big problem with authority though. i'm terrified of the first test in each class. especially psychology. those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. i really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. basically i do the same things i did at home, except now i have to do my own laundry. but the bad thing is that i don't get to cook. i love to cook. i'm also really good at it. inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. my parents say that's why i'm good'like chemistry. that's another thing. i'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. this semester my classes are not all that bad, but i still have a long way to go. everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. i don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically i just want to pass with cs. although i'd do anything to graduate in the cum laude. school is really the only thing that i've been better than average in. i don't even think i really excel in that! there just always seems to be many others that are better than me. for once in my life i want to win something or be the best at something. but, i'm rushing for the theta tau fraternity. it is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. i met some of the members today. they seem to be really awesome! i'm nervous that they won't like me though. they seemed to be interested in me today though. more so than the other people who were there. my boyfriend, whom i love dearly, is pledging the phi psi fraternity. i don't approve at all. he spends most of his time with these guys. not once has he invited me to go to their parties'outings. he always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. i can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. i know he loves me, but i still feel left out. most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. but on thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. it's a semi-formal party. he has to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that i meet these guys. i really don't like fraternities or sororities. i hate everything they stand for. but i like theta tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. these other greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. i detest smoking. ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a ""social smoker. "" i have told him how i feel and asked that he at least not smoke when i'm around because i refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. besides, i don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. i care way too much about him. we've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. he's really important to me and i'd do anything for him. that's why i hate the fraternity so much. i see the bad influences they have on him. he wants to go to medical school, and he must have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. he certainly has the potential and i really don't want him to fail. but, i really need to learn to let others lead their lives. i know i can't boss everyone around. i know i'm very controlling and that i've really made some bad feelings between us, but i can't help it. i get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when i think about all that stuff. i hate it when people don't listen to me (usually i end up being right too). well, that's 20 minutes.

" okay, i thought right now would be the best time to do this. i'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. these last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. we got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. this is all that keeps playing over and over right now. where did we mess up? well the past is the past and you can't change it. my dad came down and was very disappointed. he didn't know i had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and i don't evne get drunk. i get a buzz and i'm good. i have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. for some reason he doesn't beleive it. he was furious. he's always trusted me for everything and never thought i'd mess up like this. i do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. i have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. i never wanted to disappoint my parents. i kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. so they would think of me as they saw me everyday. this last senior year i started going to parties and hanging out with different people. i'm a real easy going person. the way i think is that i don't care aobut anything. i let things happen. i make the decisions that i think are right at the time and let whatever happen. i like to make people happy. i'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something i let them argue and win. if they think they are right than they feel good. as for me i don't care. i know i'm right or wrong and i let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. so aobut the drinknig i have no idea what lead me to it. i used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. everyone liked me but i never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because i was the only indian at my school and i was easy gonig and friendly. i hate no one, i think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. once someone screws me over than i don't like them but until then i try to get along with everyone. well i guess that's why i staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. very bad excuse, i know. my dad thinks it's peer pressure. peer pressure has never gotten to me i odn't think. i have a strong will about serious things. if i think it's bad and will do something to me i don't like than i won't do it. i tried weed too because i wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. i tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and i have astma so i decdie that wasn't for me. i never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. so so i decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times i liked the feeling. it was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. my mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. my mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. i would hate that. my dad i don't know. as i sit here thikngi aobut him i feel more and mroe sorry. he came yesterday and gave me a lecture and i said i wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because i couldn't be sincere i thought it was bullshit. a few drinks every now and then can't hurt. well i know it can but still it's weird i don't know how to explain. well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. me and my dad rarely talk i talk to my mom aobut my problems, so i got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if i was still going to dirnk and if i had done any other drugs. he doesn't trust me me anymore. that hurts the worst. i'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because i l;iek to think things thorugh. right now i feel very guilty. i totally blew my dad off this afternoon and i saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. i guess i get it from him. it's weird. so now i'mthinkngi aobut how i can make it up. i got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. we tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. but somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. my dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. she said i sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. for some reason i still lsiten ot her so i'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that i'm going to stop drinknig. i really do want to stop now. i know i can stop if i put my mind to it. i don't need alcohol anymore. one night can ruin the next 6 years haha. it's crazy

"well, what to write about? i just got done playing football, we won. i am glad that we won because i really hate to lose. in high school my team went 3 and 7, and that just drove me crazy. as our record got worse my teammates stopped trying, and that killed me inside. i don't know what to really write about, i don't really feel much right now. i guess that means that i am happy with myself. school is cool so far. it is a lot different from high school, because you can't really get to know your teachers and let them help you get through all of your stuff. it sucks that texas lost. i can't believe that they wasted their season already. i just got back from seeing my sister. she is 8 months pregnant with her first baby. it is a little boy and they are going to call it jason jr. that is real cool, i really like little babies. i hope that when i have a baby(hopefully not for quite a while) that it is not too fat. that is one of my biggest fears, having fat kids. i guess because i can remember the hell that i put the fat kids through when i was little. i also wish that i could type faster. i have been sitting here for fifteen minutes already and i only have a quarter of a page done. if i was to double space it i guess i would have half a page, but i haven't yet. i wonder if you want it double spaced. i guess i will go ahead and double space it for you. well that's twenty minutes so i will finish this line and then go take a shower.

"i'm writing a stream of consciousness paper, yeah! well, my friend john is sitting next to me submitting his calculus homework. i'm wondering if i will have more success when i submit mine. john's a good guy but never helps out with calculus. some friend. i wish that this thing was over. 20 minutes is looking like a long time. i didn't think twenty minutes could be so long. i guess it's all relativity. if i was on a beach in cancun 20 minutes would go by in the blink of an eye. but here, no. i'm hear for eternity, or twenty minutes whichever comes first. the internet is down in my room so i have to use this damn facility at the base of my dorm, man this sucks. the damn airwave guy was supposed to come down and take care of the internet problem but it turns out he doesn't give a rat's ass about the internet or my calculus or my stream of consciousness, man he sucks big time. keep thinking about trina wonder what she is doing. wonder how many guys she is been with since rejecting me. damn, stay positive, it's the only way to get through boring times. shouldn't smoke anymore either. smoking's bad and yet it's so damn good. man good thing i don't smoke or i might be enjoying a good nicotine buzz right now. what's the deal with hannah anyway? i mean i'm not attracted to her anymore because she reaks of desperation i mean that bugs me. why does she always have to guilt trip me, fooling around with her is like a full time job. wish i could have gone to jack in the box even though that food will make me fat. hannah said that food would make her fat. maybe we're both right. i hate the cafeteria food here. today i couldn't stomach any of it. got to make a check out to tom for 25 dollars for the ceiling fans that weren't even put in the right way. that dude with the messed up teeth installed the improperly the first time anyway, they almost crushed john and marissa. what a shit weekend, john had someone to do and i didn't haha. clever pun. clever reminds me of that one girl i met at the ato house and we talked macbeth and i got her number but that didn't stop her from not returning my calls, i need to find some way to get a flask into the football games that way the buzz doesn't wear off and i can keep on buzzing baby. yeah i remember the time on this very computer i walked by and some australian dude was looking at the most obscene porn i've ever seen in my life. i wonder what everyone else's stream of consciousness papers look like. i wonder if mine is ore or less neurotic than everyone else. i really should get a girlfriend like my sweet mate tom the golden boy. he is the golden boy because he wins at fucking everything. smart, good looking, athletic, in a word i hate his guts. but i don't really he is my friend i just wish the playing field was a little more even so that i could get some females for whatever reason. the guy is so lucky, he is rich and he doesn't really have to make grades in college and he has enough money to join a fucking frat and it pisses me off because the frat guys wanted me too but i have neither the money nor the time with school because some of us have to make the grade just to get a decent job and make a little money. i thought college would be so cool, but it absolutely sucks. i mean, why did i have this delusion that college would be so damn great, it's just like high school. which was just like middle school with cars. man, life is truly what you make of it. on the one hand you got fewer people hassling you, on the other hand you have a lack of support. man i wish we hadn't got cable in our room, now i especially don't want to study, i need mary jus t called me. better not answer. she is kinda weird, maybe she got an ou ut wristband, yeah well, sorry i didn't get you your i'd mary, you shouldn't have left it over here. i wish i had a car and also some more socks because when you've got socks you don't have to do as much laundry. jessica simpson is such a bitch, all through middle school me and my friends would have killed to get some"" from her. but now that she has that new show on mtv that's all reality and stuff i realize what an absolute hose beast she is, man she sucks big time well its getting near the end of this i wonder where the research page is so i can get some credit hours and not fail the damn class. i suppose that 's it 3 v sorry dude i only signed up for twenty.

"the funny thing is he doesn't seem very worried about it. i have a calculus test thursday and i'm really scared! it is my first test and its my hardest class. i have no idea what the hell is going on in there. this frustrates me because usually i'm very good at math. i'm hopefully going to get tutored before the test. walking around campus is very different to me . there is all these people swarming around everywhere ,each one extremely different from the next. it scares me because i feel as though i don't belong anywhere. in high school it was very easy to be noticed because the school only had about 5,000 people in it. i was involved in many different organizations had lots of friends, but i am the only one out of my group of friends to be here. it still seems very weird to me. i feel like i have all this pressure to succeed here from my parents. its like 'don't screw up' is constantly going through my head. my parents seem to be waiting for me to screw up in one way or another . well, got to go do more assignments. ------ ",0,1.130565 -1.034555 -0.268856 -0.616582 0.091448 -3.557578 1.06822 -0.345404 0.73004 -1.768094 -0.192867 -0.590446 1.628358 0.564946 1.69532 0.0 -0.04277 -0.289496 0.166875 -0.795527 -0.038163 -0.742368 -1.139061 -1.003316 -0.624052 -0.728503 1.82017 1.377234 1.264368 -0.761503 -1.100231 0.832229 2.691786 4.576116 1.777513 -1.109326 -1.733426 0.529555 -2.51419 -1.708647 0.834999 -0.308008 3.579831 -1.408626 -1.429535 -1.542652 0.918637 -0.718262 -1.817532 -1.631768 0.31203 -2.174312 -0.42646 -1.210149 0.396707 3.127265 1.430043 -0.954251 -0.081818 -1.376534 1.647113 0.387543 1.001955 1.952196 3.477547 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.175968 -0.413732 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 0.245252 3.903435 -0.422267 0.671855 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.587251 5.219156 4.159007 4.629929 5.108994 4.277975
"my friends keep me awake until ridiculously late hours, and then are so inconsiderate as to wake me up early in the morning. today for example, my friend kevin woke me up around 9 this morning, after keeping me awake until 4 in the morning! i have 4 and a half hours of classes on this day, not to mention a bible study at 7, and i'm supposed to help clean up the erwin center for a fund raiser after the shania twain concert. i don't think i'm going to do that though, as i really need to catch up on some sleep. at the same time though, i'm also excited to hear from my friend jaren in maine. there's really a weird story behind how we met. as most people do nowadays, i was chatting online in one of the chatrooms. this girl was the only one who didn't seem to lie about how pretty she is and how rich she is etc. , so i had a fascination with her from the beginning. she actually sent me the private message first and asked where i was from, what i do for fun, what i look like etc. from that day on, there hasn't been a single day where we haven't written each other. after a few months in fact, we began calling each other on a regular basis, which didn't please my parents at all. hehe. i know her better than her friends do, which really gives me much pleasure. we send each other pictures and we're really open about what we do and stuff. i don't think i've ever kept anything from her, and i know she doesn't keep anything from me because she tells me things that she knows would upset me, but she tells them anyway. over these last few months, i've grown to love her as a girlfriend. weird, i know. well, she feels the same about me and she's planning on visiting for the first time sometime this winter. i even get jealous when she talks about other guys, which is really weird, first of all because we've never met in person, and second of all, because she lives over a 1000 miles away. talking about her always reminds me of my other friend christina. there's another funny story behind this relationship as well. she was best friends with one of my good friends, yoon. well, yoon liked this one guy named young, and they always hung out together. christina and this guy brian hung out with them too all the time. well, brian started to like christina and she detests him, so she felt really uncomfortable alone with him. one time, she felt so awkward, that she decided to call me, even thought we'd never met or talked before ever, rather than have to talk to brian. yoon gave her my number and told christina that i was easy to talk to and to get along with. well, christina and i ended up talking for over 4 hours that night. every night since then, we talked on the phone every day for hours at a time. if it wasn't for her, i would've averaged more than 4 hours sleep a day!! i began to grow very fond of her as well. i got incredibly jealous when she dated my best friend allen. he treated her like crap and that really upset me. they broke up after a month, but because he was best friend, i couldn't ask her out. i wasn't sure what the consequences would have been. she moved to california in early june, and that was probably the most sad i'd ever been in my life. a few months before she left, i decided to tell her how i felt, and to my surprise, she felt the same way about me. that actually depressed me even more, because i passed up the chance to be with the girl i wanted to be with most. well, things don't always work out the way you want them to. one thing i'm worried about right now has nothing to do with what i've been talking about. its my car stereo. many people think i'm weird because i have this fascination with naming my possessions. for example, my car stereo cost over 2200 and i named it veronica. my tennis rackets have names as well. my favorite racket is called excalibur. anyway, i'm famous for my stereo because not only does it sound very nice, but it can shake your house from miles away. hehe. well, my apartment that i live in isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods, so i've been extra cautious about playing it loud so that people won't know its in there. last night though, i was showing off to one of my friends and forgot about it. a group of who appeared to be ""gang members"" walked past my car and everyone of them was staring at my car. i heard stories about how many people got their cars broken into, so i was really scared at that moment. i'm always looking out the window when i hear a noise now. it's getting kind of ridiculous. my roommate warned me about that, but i was too caught up in trying to show off to my friends. i can only hope that it doesn't get stolen. i've got a huge headache right now too. i think it's a combination of several factors. one, is that i haven't gotten any sleep. another is that i am ""kind of"" sick right now, feeling a little light headed. its also very hot in this house. i try to take naps after class, but i had absolutely no time today. but at least i have the weekend to look forward to. my eating habits have been rather unhealthy as well. too much fast food and going out. its showing too, around the gut that is! some people have started calling me ""jiggly jay"", while others change it up a little and call me ""gigolo jay. "" i'm not quite sure why they call me jay either. my name is jason and i've always gone by jason. some things just don't have an explanation i guess. hope you enjoyed reading this.

"my life is an out of control freight train. i know not where i am going or how i am going to get there. throw a match upon me and i could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. but for what reason do you do this? i hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that i pass the question. why am i all of the sudden asking myself why? i know where i came from but does this mean i cannot know where i am going? on i travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. this gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. this is why i am grateful that i do not have to face the world alone. my life is full of love and hope. my hopes of myself are to touch some person the way i have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. this ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and i can see through your blurry sight. and i can see through you! your rules mean nothing to me and mine. i live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. i draw so much upon my music that i sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. my life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings.

"sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing. there's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 20 minutes and try and make it completely coherent. the music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling. then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue. adversaries in between as if rapids in the path. the sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky. now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest. the light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside. i watch my friends sit next to me. one is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm, the other sits and types quietly. the music is quieter now with bell like rings in it. the bass has a slow but progressive sound to it. the guitar sings about as the music moves on. over the middle window, the one with the blinds shut, we keep the blue mask. it has sharp looking teeth which are yellow. the teeth match the horns. i'm now half past the time of when i started. some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs. sorry for the time of which i slacked. i loosing ideas of what to write now. i have little more to to tell of my surroundings more. the music is now more of a popping sounds. it also mud like sounding guitar now. my phone is ringing now but i got my friend to pick it up. i will call them back. this is now the end.

"since i am already on the computer i am going to do 1 writing assignment. that's good because i wont have to worry about it later. i can take care of other things on my list, and i 'll be that much closer to going home. i like my new place. its big and cold and my best buds live there. theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. this fella really has a stick up his ass. i respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. it sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. i can tell this is going to be a problem. we've already had words several times. what blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. i mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year! am i the only one thinking here? i really had to get raw then, telling him that that is not how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. he wants to shack up with me, cap, and bob, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. also, bob's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. i don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. everyone else does. i love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. they're engaged, and she still gives everybody the ""look"" when he leaves the room. i feel sorry for him. but i should probably be glad it's not still me. i think the only reason that i bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like i do. like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. those were some of my best friends ever. i'll keep in touch with them, but when i talk to them i always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. they say they'll be back next semester, but i don't believe. a lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. that's why i stay focused and that's why i'll stay at ut.

it has been raining for the past 4 days and i guess that has a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. i feel a little relieved and tired though i had my first test of the semester this morning. i feel tired because i spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like i should have. now i was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. i should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. i called my father today. i'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason i seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that i know that i am doing wrong but i still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. i guess he think is that if i am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. i'm trying to get it to him that i still have a lot of things going for me. i guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. i feel totally different though. i believe that i have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well i will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise ,1,1.472644 -0.962433 0.741807 -1.251181 -0.628978 -0.352682 0.718915 0.090821 0.151482 -1.397003 -0.102702 -0.590446 0.765832 1.074397 0.853848 0.0 -0.04277 0.87615 0.775577 -0.795527 0.604065 0.80814 0.746565 -0.141419 -0.624052 0.893241 0.102074 -0.463485 0.240573 0.56539 -1.100231 0.86584 -0.248018 -0.906028 -1.017959 1.403005 -1.045048 0.850859 -1.183496 -1.13216 0.228976 0.574021 -0.97374 -0.250688 -1.429535 -0.951536 2.309859 0.443044 -1.338325 0.632825 -0.78577 0.302008 -0.057488 0.745976 0.191372 -1.689914 -0.921618 -0.954251 -0.631518 0.125912 -0.483808 5.796254 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.537535 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.881019 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.553944 4.934402 4.34321 4.387944 4.971457 4.095867
"what should i write about?. anything that pops into my head? okay. well, i have to write edwin email and via snail mail. i told him i'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to san antonio. that was one fun and exciting weekend. i miss him so much. i think of him as much as i do about jon. but jon more so, of course. i can't wait to see edwin again. mom's cooking really smells good. she's cooking filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. the watercolor picture on the front cover of the psycho text is quite unusual. looks like one of picasso's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. hmmmm. how much more time do i have? eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. i keep thinking about aol and the internet. i have to catch up with my email writing and afls posts. i rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. there are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. lea posts there, though. that's really nice of her. very thoughtful lady. but what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. they probably know more about lea than they do about themselves. they're so obsessed. i just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but i'm not that type of person. i like writing this way. it's like a diary or a journal of some sort. i should do this more often. it's quite relaxing. i used to keep a diary. i'd tell it everything, especially how i felt about edwin when i was younger. about 10 or 11 years old or so. i had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. he liked me, too, big time. it was only a few weeks ago, when i saw him after 10 years that i confessed. we were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. it felt so natural he said so himself. i could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. and we shared so many common interests that i never knew we had before. my, what a story we have. it's like a long lost love affair. this writing assignment is pretty neato. just writing down thoughts. putting it into words. i could write a whole novel. haha! i'm still thinking of edwin. but, alas, i am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. i didn't really know him back when i was 10 years old. his family, yes, but not him. it's only during high school that i got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. it wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in edwin's case. i eventually fell for jon and i will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as i shall live. should i end here? i've got one more minute. well, it's at least 20 minutes, but i feel like writing more. my mom's cooking smells great. well, time's up but i'll keep on writing. i need to go to the bathroom, too. so, until next time. this is confidential right? now, where's that submit button?

"i am beginning to write this assignment and i'm thinking that is a pretty big waste of time. i'm already bored and i don't like it. i can smell the bread i got at la madelines and it smells pretty good. i don't normally eat there so it was a treat and i was there with a good friend so it was pretty fun. my friend'roommate just flushed the toilet and i think it sucks down pretty hard. alright only eighteen minutes to go. the more i smell the bread the more i want to eat it. it smells really good. the tv is on right now and it is on mtv, the voice of our generation. i was watching a show on christina aguilara and realized how gorgeous she really was when she dresses normally. man i'm hungry! i got to say i want to pierce my lip. the more i think about it the more i want to do it. i think it would so cool. and i want a tattoo. too bad my dad is anal about stuff like that. oh well, one of these days. we better beat the hell out of arkansas next saturday or i'll be pissed. my friend made me laugh because he heard this commercial for the dumbest movie ever, malibu's most wanted. i could go for some cereal. my mom's in europe on a cruise right now. queer eye for the straight guy is the dumbest excuse for television ever. what a waste of time that was. they don't even dress like straight guys. they are really gay and there style sucks. jimmy fallon is a funny guy i met him in new york. it is weird how peoples minds drift. i wish i could be a professional assassin. not even a ninja assassin, just one with a cool silenced gun. i don't know why. it just seems cool. to take care"" of evil men. like in the boondock saints, the greatest movie ever. i hope i get to run track in the spring and i make the team. that would be like a dream come true. i would be a college athlete. that would be neat. and all the ladies love that. i think music is a great thing. i hope i find a bassist for my man while i'm here and we can play a show here at emo's. this is taking a lot longer than i thought it would. beyonce knowles is a good looking' woman. i don't know why she likes jay-z. to be famous would be nice, but to be a doctor would be nicer because i earned that. good charlotte sucks. they are terrible live and i don't get why people like them. the guitarist isn't even good. i'm half way done. that is nice to know. my mind is being strained. the texans one today and they beat the dolphins. that is awesome because some thought the dolphins would win the super bowl. we'll see about that. texas football rules. my old high school one its first game of the season yesterday and they did well. my little brother one his first high school of his career and he was pretty proud. he is on the a team and that is a big deal. blah blah, that is what my mind thinks. its neat to see what people can think of. i need to buy some milk for my room. i could go fro some cocoa-cocoa dyno bytes. they are so good, and chocolaty. mmmmmm. delicious. instant messaging is an interesting concept in these connected times of ours. that would suck to be a worm. have no legs and what not, i need to get xp for my computer so i have word, excell and power point. that would be nice. only six minutes to go. i don't know why people love asses so much. its kinda gross when people think about what they really are. chris rock is pretty find. he just has a really big mouth and i'm surprised he hasn't gotten beaten up. it was jack black's birthday not too long ago and he is really funny. i just started showing my friend how to play the guitar and she is doing pretty well. probably because she knows how to play the violin. david blaine is the most amazing street magician ever. the olsen twins are worth over a billion dollars. rock music is the best sort of music because i can get into it more i think. rap isn't real music. just like good charlotte. i like evanescence because that girl is hot and linkin park is good because they are different. the white stripes suck however because that girl can't drum to save her life. it is interesting to see how people interact. i don't know why. maybe that is why i want to be a psychiatrist. i'm trying to spell correctly on this and i don't know why. maybe so you can understand what is being typed on this crazy assignment. linkin park won the best rock video award. it was interesting. i don't know why. that band has a lot of asians in it. metallica is a well received band because they are good. i could never be a typical rock star because i can't think i could be that mean to people.

" gregory benjamin's writhing assingment, september 11, 2001. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but i don't think it would be so bad. in the meantime, i still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. i do not want to read it! it is simply boring! blah, blah, blah, building, blah blah blah. i am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. i wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats thermal delight in architecture that is. it is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). boring!. on thursday, i have visual communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. the proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he does not. i honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. anyways, i am majoring in somehing i love to do, so i guess i can trudge though the school. some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at wal-mart, the consumer of business). speaking of stuff i love to do, i love music! i really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since i have been wanting to do architecture since i was like, four, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . . on a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the counter reset!!! nooooo! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 500? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 680, and i knew people there. speaking of people from high scool, one of them is in this class. say hello to jeff prudon everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well try to call him out) you get your own personl shout out jeff! from the proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is i love what i do and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . and again, i won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i can t spell worth crap&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products! (oh wait. we already are!) i am running win xp right now :) i do like it, it hasn't crashed yet. . knock on wood. it would crash while i am doing something for class though, with my terrible luck. (spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 4 minutes left! hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. i guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! it would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . whoops! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. i find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 20min are up, and i have to sleep myself!

"after the first day of class, i went to my dorm room and tried to sit down and do this assignment. to my luck, i was unable to get connected to this address. oh well. my sister id talking to me right now. she actually thinks i'm listening to her. i guess that is why i am a theater major. right now she's reading me the principal from the black lagoon. my sister is a special education teacher in killeen, texas. we are at my mom's elementary school, in her office. she happens to be a principal. the reason i'm back at home this fine labor day weekend is because i was unfortunate enough to be born in september. yes i am still seventeen. back to what i was thinking about. oh yeah i am home now because i need to have my parent's permission to do the experimental research for this class. i am going back to school on monday. i feel bad leaving my room in such a mess, but my roommate went to fort worth to visit her best friend at tcu. gretchen is her name. she is not having such a grand time at school so she convinced kristin, my roommate, to go up there and visit her. well i only have ten minutes left to type. i am so glad you don't plan to read these assignments because the typographical errors are plentiful. my sister is such a dork. she is singing everything that she would normally speak. she graduated from the university of texas. (along with her husband) she keeps asking me if i am excited about going to school at ut. of course i am. she wishes she had majored in theatre. don't get me wrong she loves teaching, but her first love was the theatre. i need to get organized. i still haven't called my friends to go hang out with them, and i have been home for a couple of days now. i have no idea why i haven't called. maybe it's because i know i have a lot of things to do such as homework, or laundry, or last minute items to buy from wal-mart. it has nothing to do with not wanting to see them. i guess well i don't know . i guess that's why i am in this psychology class. i always wanted to take psychology in high school, but i never had time to take in my schedule. the psychology teacher was also my honors english teacher my sophomore year. she was a pretty cool lady. well twenty minutes have passed and as much as i would like to continue chatting with you, but i have a lot of other homework to do. i am also very tired. i stayed up half the night . it was a sad night learning of princess diana's death. i have the chills.

" coming to ut has been a pretty crazy experience. my first week here i already felt like i was at home. it wasnt that way at the college i attended previously. that place took my two years to get comfortable. i think it has something to do with the fact that i have grown friendlier to most people. the one exception is my roommate drew. i don't know why we arent best friends, but i think it has a lot to do wiht the fact that we come from two entirely distinct backgrounds. he was the son of a cop, whos prents got divorced, and i was the son of a librarian, who parents always talked about getting divorced. also, here women seem to enjoy my preasance more, i think that has a lot to do with my radical overhaul of my diet and exercise routine. one girl in particular is named vanessa. she is an entirely charming girl, with a body to die for, but i don't know. how do we trully know we found the right one, is it that divine spark that fills our soul thew first time we lay eyes on a person or is it a familiarity that stems from shared time with someone that eventually turns to amore? unfortunantly i was cursed with finding love at frist sight with my fist girl friend. but being as young as we were, i cnat help but think what would hve happened if we would have met later. on this subject i have often wondered about my parents, i have a vague notion that theirs was a marraige of convience. i overheard one day that the last time they had sex was the night i was concieved?!?!!??! i don't now what that means, just came up. this i think is the point of life. the wondering, lust filled age we are in now, followed by silent impotent contemplation. no wonder why all people in power are old and white. they don't have the drive in their hearts to find romantic ideals the way youth does. in a sense i think i am an idealist. i like to see the glass as half full, but usually only with people i care about. this deals alot with social conciense. what a terrible thing to have. all of us who are educated are confronted evertday with the absurdities of our goals. i want to have a nice house and car for my family and i want to help the world. but would i accept lesser for those i love to compensate those i do not know?!?!?! off course not, yet high minded individuals lambast me when they are doing the exact smae thing. so in the end what does one do, pursue their own intersts or bang ones head against the system. i think it has to be a mixure of the two. because the more one knows, the more one knows that nothing in this world is blakc and white. tragis heroes are made from this assumption. we see how they are commended for making the right choice and getting awarded for it. but seldom do we see all the others who struggle to make the moraly right choice and are punished incesantly. growing up poor i saw this all around me, many of the poeple i know cannot afford to make the right descision. i myself have chosen to get a college eduction rather than have medical insurance. really in the last 10 years i have done a lot rather than have medical insurance, namely eating, having clothes, and living life. all this ties into the idea that there are not racial barriers anymore, but class barriers that are divided by check books. thats not to sya that the overwhelming majority of poor are not minority, but only looking at color doesnt diagnose the true problem, money.

"right now it is 11:25. i am sitting by myself in the dorm at hardin house. it is raining very hard outside. earlier i went to target and bought a brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so i got home and then had to drive all the way back. i am from tulsa, oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. i love ut however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when i go out at night. i went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged theta. i am having so much fun and i love all of the girls in my sorority. my friends and i have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. when i walk in the room i don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. also since living in austin i have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. i have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. i have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example hula hut, shady grove, dirty's and much more. as i walk down the drag i notice that there is a large variety of people in austin. yesterday i had my first encounter with the infamous leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street. apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. also today when i went to einstein bagels i looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. college in austin is much different than my small private high school in tulsa. i never knew how sheltered we all were and i am so glad that i have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real"" world. right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. it is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. i live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. although there are many distractions at hardin house, i am so glad this is where i live. i have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50,000 plus people. sometimes it is, like when i walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. but then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. i have already found a group of people i ""hang out"" with everyday and i almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. i am so excited for the arkansas game this weekend. football is my favorite sport and i really hope the longhorns can beat ou this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. on tuesday i joined a group call tag, texas advertising group, because i am trying to transfer in to the communications college. i am a little nervous about that because i heard it was very difficult. i am currently in the liberal arts school as an english major. my classes seem to be going very well. i think after this paper i am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the sex and the city dvd with my friends because they are all avid watchers while i have never seen a single episode. i never really get hooked on a tv series. i always just watch the show when it comes out on video.

"so i'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. i feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but i wanted to get it over with. it think it's funny that you, prof. penn, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. it must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my psy301. my mom is always reminding me that i didn't take it in high school and that's what i get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. it shouldn't be a horrible class though. i can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. i love writing. i've been writing a summer journal for the past 10 years and i love it. i'd love to write for a living but i just do the journal thing well. i could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything i want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than i thought. it's only been 3 minutes and 59, 4 minutes, 4 minutes and 5 sec. ok i can't do that forever. what would happen if someone imed me right now? would i fail the assignment because i stopped writing? i should have turned it off. yuck. i just burped. ew, i just wrote that i just burped. see, i had spaghetti for lunch and i can still taste it because the food sucks. i miss home all ready. i feel like a dork because i miss home, and i want to go home every weekend. i need to be social. i need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 6 minutes and 11 sec, 24, 16. ok i'll stop for real now. i am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't i? i guess no one will know. why do i even care? i keep switching in and out of i and i. capitals that is. i never do capitals when i'm typing on aim so why should i do it now. i don't think it capital letters. ! well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. i hope this works because i don't have a printer that will verify that i actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, i live in san jac and i had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. i wouldn't talk to her even if i wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird! i guess it's the constant typing. this is pretty fun actually. except for the pain in my arm. i've got you under my skin. wooo ol blue eyes. geez i'm a dork. maybe you'll read this out loud to your classes, how mortified i'd be. i just try to blend in everywhere. i know you wouldn't be so mean to say my name, more or less ask me to stand up or something in class. wow, i would die of embarrassment. i'm embarrassed very easily. it had to be you. ah, i miss rex. rex is my boyfriend in michigan. he is really bothering me lately, and it's not fair for me to say he is bothering me. he called me last night to tell me he couldn't talk because his friends from gr came down to hang out with him, and i got all mad that he couldn't talk to me. man that was annoying. i'm not allowed to be mad that he has a social life and i don't. i guess i'm jealous? i don't think so. i don't know. i wish he would just not nap right now when i could be talking to him. i can be mad about that right? he could talk to me now but he decided to sleep. man my arm hurts. bleh i'm kinda thirsty, can i stop to get a drink. i guess i can wait 10 minutes. hey this is my favorite frank sinatra song. luck be a lady. man i want to do a dance to this. i want to learn how to swing dance before my wedding. there are a lot of things i want to do at my wedding, but i wanted to say before my wedding. bleh. weddings. my mom keeps telling me i'll be cut off when i get married. financially that is. she just doesn't want me to marry rex because she thinks he won't be able to provide for me, which is probably true. he really doesn't know what he wants to do. i wish money mattered a little to him. not a lot but a little. i like this song a lot. a lady doesn't leave her escort, it isn't fair, and it's not nice. this isn't really what you wanted is it? oh geez, well, why does it matter? you probably won't even read it. why would you read my paper out of the 2300 people that you have in your classes? 5 more minutes. i'm tired, my eyes feel so heavy. but i got enough sleep. maybe i got too much sleep. i hate that ann let al sleep on my bed, al smells really disgusting. i don't know how she can date someone that smells so disgusting. my arm hurts. bleh! my eys feel really heavy. sheish. 4 more minutes. my shoulders feel tired too. i want to go out tonight. i don't want to see major again and i don't really want to hang out with da, but i feel like i need to go out and do stuff. i'm really sick of eating by myself. really sick of it. it's the worst feeling to watch the evening sitcoms in jester city limits by yourself. how come everyone else has friends to eat with and not me? lcuk be a lady toooniiiiggggghhhhttt. wow, i'm a giant dork. wow. how mortified i would be if you knew who i was or if you even read it, or if you *gasp* read it out loud in my class. i'd probably cry and run out. i've been crying a lot lately because of rex. a lot. i really like crying sometimes because it just lets me let it out. i had to go all the way to the edge of campus last night because ann was here with al and was doing. well, whatever they were doing. and i had to go by the river to cry about rex. well, one more minute. i hope you never read this, and i hope i get credit for it. all i ask is that you don't let anyone see it if you really do read it. that would be mortifying. and even if it is a good example for the assignment. i would be so mortified. you have no idea. ok 55, 56, self destruct, ?

"okay, now is the time -- i usually don't have trouble writing for a long period of time - at least typing, because i think i type faster than i write. i am continuously writing e-mails to people. in fact, one semester i was even addicted to the internet! i was always on it. i wasn't as bad as my roommate at the time thought he never even went to class! i couldn't believe it. at least i knew to be addicted at nighttime! anyway - i enjoy typing and i really enjoy writing my thoughts. this stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior year in high school when we got to read james joyce in my english class. it was the best book i read all year - the portrait of the artis as a young man - does this computer have a way to skip to the next line, or do i do that myself? well - i shall do it myself. ok - anyway - about stephen dedalus - in james joyce. the entire book was written the way i am writing this essay. i guess it is an essay -- i always thought they were spelled like s. a. ! but - that seems stupid when you think about it. psychology really seems interesting. but - i know the tests are hard. i am graduating in december and i have always wanted to take psy. i just never had the time when it came to my major and all the government, etc. classes i had to take. i can't wait to graduate. there is so much red tape at this institution. yesterday - just to add into a class that wasn't even full - my god. you would think the class is controlled by zeus himself! i had to fill out forms - and then i had to make inquiries and get permission from the professor. just so i could take accounting 310f for non- business majors that isn't even a grade for me since i am taking it pass'fail. now does that not sound stupid. sometimes i think education has become too much like government. not enough quality - just a lot of quantity of bs where nothing is really ever accomplished. the status quo just seems to prevail. i think that is terrible. but -if you think about it - it makes sense. this institution cares not if i get a good education- but rather if i am able to jump through all the hoops it places before me. whether i can read the fine print and take all the courses and get all the red tape cut before i graduate. is that what the college experience should be about? i guess college prepares a person for life. not in the classes taken per se - but in the lifestyle of the student. so - if i understand that life is simply college magnified, and if i can jump through all the hoops placed before me in college and actually graduate with my 120 hours, then maybe life won't be as complicated and difficult. the question then becomes if life gets more simple and less strenuous and frustrated, then shouldn't college follow in suit? since i don't believe that will ever happen, i guess the college is here to stay. if anything - college prepares a person for graduate school! law school, oy - a yiddish expression - i can't wait for that! i am taking a course now on constitutional law by dr. perry. i absolutely love it. - it mystifies me, the constitution. what does is cover - what responsibilities does it have. how does one know? all these questions can be answered and asked in this class. there are only 10 people in the class - compared to the 500 or so in psy. class, i would say that's pretty good! i think i figured out how to do these lines on this computer i just have to push return before getting to the end of the line instead of writing one line to eternity. how does the ta actually know that i spent 20 minutes on this? what if i simply type really fast and i get more words on the screen than the next guy? what if i say -- well, it's only been 5 minutes but - i gotta go? who ever thought of that movie with woody allen about the future and sex is regulated! damn! i promised myself to write about everything in the world not having anything to do with sex. i thought that for 20 minutes i could think of not having sex. damn. i guess i am just a typical 21 year old guy who can't get his mind out of the gutter. that really upsets me i always thought i could be more than the average joe. well - that shall be for my next paper on the college experience. boy - are y'all gonna love that or what?!! gotta go now -- the professor is calling me!!!

"the incredible sense of freedom i feel is probably what i feel the most. i walk around looking at all the other students and i feel like all these people are the future of my children. college is one step up in my step ladder of life and i think it is overwhelming for all freshman. right now i have this great motivation that i am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. i'm glad to be away from home. i thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. my past professors in high school had warned my that i would have to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents i wouldn't be able to understand. they warned me that i would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. well things turned out totally different. my major is advertising which means i only need 3 hours of math, which i placed out of by taking the sat ii. so i don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. i also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. i enjoy all my classes. every teacher makes me laugh. i'm wondering if i'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. i love the technology that teachers use today. i love that if i miss a class, which i haven't yet, i can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. the internet is clearly a life saver. i feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. right now i am appreciating the fact that i can type without looking at the keyboard because i notice some people around me having some trouble. i've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that i have been here in austin. it's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. one thing that i'll definitely have to get used to is how i don't recognize anyone when i walk from class to class. in high school everyone knows everyone and at ut it is quite different. my older sister is a psychology major from incarnate word university in san antonio. i'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what i learn. i've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. i'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft.

"it is 5:24 in the afternoon. i wonder how long 20 minutes really is and how much i can write. time always seems to go by so slow when i'm bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, i'm in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. i hated him when i was a kid. we were in the same chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. i guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. i'm so bored. the only noise i hear is the humming of the a'c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. i'm really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. i hate bugs of any shape and size. all i know is that i'm beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 5:35 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy da dee da. i don't know what to write. the more i sit here, the more impatient i get and the more paranoid i am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an asian fraternity house. i'm not trying to say asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. i wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. i hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow'brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. i basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that i paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while i'm in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 5:41. and frank and my friend tony just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though i don't like mcdonalds, i always crave it when i smell it. oh well, i'm just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah!

" hi. my name is shanique annette roberson. usually when i have to write something i like to introduce myself first. i did not prewrite this i promise. i was born november 27, 1985 (the day before thanksgiving). i am now 18 years old and am excited about being in the college of engineering at the university of texas at austin as a biomedical engineering major. i love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. some things that i would like to do before i leave austin or before i graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( i don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. i would also like to get involved in a good service organization. i love service and helping other people. oh! about my family. i am the daughter of lee and nancy roberson of bay city, tx. i have one older sister, joyce evette roberson. my father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the u. s. navy. she (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to iraq as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). she has now been restationed to florida. this makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. she picked a bad state to go to. anyway, i told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as i could come and visit at least once (ha! like i could really decide where she would go. i just thought i'd try it). she would have flown me to iraq to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in egypt but my mom wouldn't let me go. she didn't want the both of us over there. however, i plan to go visit in florida either during christmas break or spring break. my thoughts have now shifted to the wells family. this is a family or couple that i meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. i had gone to national baptist conference in florida and was flying back to houston by myself. they told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. when we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 4 years now. we send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. i think that that is just amazing. what esle to talk about???? ok i am just getting words now. (friends, other homework, love,oh) let me tell you about the home i would like. i was raised in a somewhat country area and i came seem to get awat from that. i would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and i know that i want horses, dogs, and cats. i don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when i think of what i want my future home to look like. also i have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. i don't know exactly where i would like this house but i think i would like it to be somewhere in tx. time is almost up and this is about all that i can think of right now anyway so bye and i will see you next time. the one and only.

"i try to overcome all the pessimistic thoughts that i or anyone else could possibly have and look at all the bright spots in my life. today i had a very rough day with my classes. waking up at seven in the morning for a class at eight and not finishing class till five is not my idea of fun. i do feel very exhausted, but i know things could be worse. there are so many people around me who are going through much more than i am and i'm grateful that i'm fortunate enough to have what i have and be where i am right now. sure, i may be exhausted right now but i feel better than ever because i know that life is full of fun and i can't look away from the optimistic side of life for one second. doing that would lead me to miss all the fun life has in store for me. so i feel very excited now, although very very tired, because i know that i have my whole life in front of me to look forward to. i try to keep my thoughts and feelings on the up side no matter how bad times are because it is not good to think negatively when you are in a good mood, let alone in a very bad mood. thus i feel great just as usual!!

"ok. i don't know much about this computer stuff. i was lucky to even get on to this homepage. well i just got disconnected and i think my tension level just went up a few notches. i am felling really sick already and i went this day to end. i was planning to go work out tonight but it is too late. i still have math and history work left to do. i really hate math, i can't understand anything that is being said. it really makes me feel like an idiot. i look at my friends here and they all understand everything that is being said . i wish my math class in high school had taught me more. i guess tomorrow i will get up to go run. ok. i just hit another wrong button , now i really feel worthless. i am going to have so much trouble this semester, when am i going to get to the classes that i really want. it is looking like i'm going to graduate college in another twenty years. as long as i do my best then i guess everything will work out. i miss my family and my friends back in ohio. i wish that i could go back sometimes. if there was anything to go back to. i don't think that they really care that i am so far away. it is like i think to myself that things might be so much better there. like if i went back then my life would all make since. i think that i would be confused anywhere i go. well my typing is starting to slow down now. my hands are getting tired. god, i should have taking a typing class in high school. my sweet mate is watching late night and it is starting to get on my nerves. it is so loud. please let my twenty minutes be up. i need to get my act together if i don't then i will just be wasting my parents money. maybe i should give my parents a call. but i think that i will wait for them to call me. i need to prepare for school. i need to try to socialize more. if i could manage more time. maybe i should be an actor and work as a waiter in new york in the mean time. but there i go again with my fantasies. i'm probably stuck with a boring life like most people. well my twenty minutes is up, i hope that my slow typing has ruined this survey.

"i've decided to write this stream of consciousness paper on laptop going home to houston. my brother was doing the driving so i decided to use my time wisely and write. right now i feel relaxed going home. i still call houston my home, although for the second year in a row i've spent 9 months of the year in austin. i wonder if i'll ever call austin home. maybe only if i live here when i'm more settled in my life. what's weird is that though i am going to college with a goal, and doing reasonably well and taking courses that i myself have chosen, i still can't but help feel at time that i'm not sure where i'm going. or if i will reach these goals. i wonder if others feel the same way. i'm quite sure they do which is probably why when the weekend rolls around six packs are brought in. i, myself, have never drank, so maybe that's why i feel that i am taking the whole impact of this college thing, so much more than others. i kind of figured out why college students feel so pressured in college and i've came up with several reasons. first, you have to study like hell to do well. second, sometimes you can study and not do as well as you expect. third no folks around to cry on their shoulder and then you can't because you're a so called wuss if you do. fourth there's no tangible evidence like money to make you feel like you're going to succeed. by the time a kid reaches college level he or she wants the financial freedom of an adult but knows it way down the road. sometimes that road seems too foggy to see down. finally if your a momma or daddy's boy you miss that home cooking. with all that dry and dull food and on top of that mounds of homework and hours of studying to do any right person would not call austin their home. not just yet. we all need a safe haven to go to. mine is in houston.

"i am thinking about a lot of things right now. i just got off of work a little while ago and just ate dinner. it was really good. i really like my nails that i just got done today and i notice they look really nice as i am typing. i hope i can do okay in college. this first week seemed pretty hard and it kind of scared me. i hope it gets easier. i am thinking about how i am going to arrange my experiments and where they are located. i had a really boring time at work today. i work with a guy that goes to southest texas state university and he is about to graduate. we have been talking about college alot lately and he has helped me. i have a boyfriend named trent. i have been with him for 2 years. i am off of work tomorrow which is good that i get a brak. i just got paid this weekend and i like getting paid. i am stuck and i don't know what to write about. thins is a really good assignment though. i like doing stuff like this. 20 minutes is a long time though and i hope my computer doesn't kick me off the internet becasue it sometimes does that. i am so full right now. i had a coney from sonic and i don't think i am going to eat for a whole week. i am so fat. ever since mid way through high school, i have been fat. being with trent has made me even more fat because we eat out a lot. he has gained a lot of weight also. i love him so much and i think about him all the time. i can't wait to get through college, marry hima dn start our family. we have a lot in common and we even want the same kind of kids, you know the genders in a certain order. well i am running low on thoughts. i can't seem to think of anything clearly when i need to most, like right now. i have done these things before, like i have said, but they have only been for 5 minutes at the most. i really like the idea of going to ut but it is going to be a major challenge. i see that it will take a lot of dedication to myself. i am planning on majoring in nursing. i really didn't know what i wanted to do and nursing seemed like it was good enough and i could still go to ut. i looked at all the positive things it had and right now in this day and age, nursing is very beneficial and can be done almost anywhere, not that i want to leave texas. i can't wait until my dad starts treating me like i am an adul since i am legally now. i wish he would let go. he says he is trying to work on it but he needs to do it faster. he needs to treat me like the 18 year old college girl that i am. he won't let me be as independent as i want to be. i don't know what else i can do to prove to him that i am raised and i can take it from here, just not quite financially. my fingers are starting to get cramped. i am getting really tired and the time is going to be up soon. i am going to look around a little bit more at my class web pages then i am going to lay down and go to sleepi miss dancing. i may not have been the best at it but i miss it from high school. maybe eventually i will get into something at ut if i am good enough. of course i need to loose a little bit of weight. i would like oto take one of the excersize classes since i can't afford to join a gym. i am discovering that i don't like my car as much as i did and i think i want something a little more sportier and maybe faster.

"well, i don't know where to begin. i guess it started when she came over for lunch. i never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. she swooped in and plopped herself on my new pappason chair. she was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. as she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the hit or miss store i noticed it. how her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. i mean, don't get me wrong randy is the best friend i have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. as she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. it was barely noticeable that my over grown lab dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. then the words just fell out of her mouth. ""he's come to rescue me, and i'm going to go. "" i have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. i was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. my best friend was on her way to her life long dream. all i could do was cry and hug her. then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. there was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and celebrate! wow. she's gone. what is left of me? i sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. i mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. i don't know how long. it seems like a whole season passed. then one day, i got tired of crying. i knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and i'd be darned if i was going to let it rot inside of me. so, i did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. i joined a club. i went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. but you know what, i didn't find it. so, i began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. i left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. but, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what i'm going to do? i'm going to meet myself a man. i will find out what love is all about, and i mean real love. so, take that! thus, my man hunt began. i browsed the video dating services, the internet (big mistake, huge), i scoped men at the grocery store, i bought some roller blades and tried out hike and bike trails, but nope, nothing'. oh, i met men all right, but the kind of guys i met made me want to swear off of them forever. yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. he's out there, my prince is going to come rescue me, i just have to have faith in real love. after some serious time had passed, i stepped out of my life and looked at what i had, and noticed that my many hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. so i just plum gave up. i was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. and that was it. so, i dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then i began to pray. it helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when i shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? my heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. how in the world can the words i choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the lord? he is the absolute perfect gentleman. i began to talk with him every day. i began to listen for his voice and i began to find him everywhere i went. i realized, i was never alone. i was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. the lord god in heaven loves me, and i love him. and you know what else, after i gave my heart to jesus, i met mark. would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 great danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as dixie bolted out my front door. we met, just that simply. he has arrived at my front door now, so i better go. we are on our way to jamaica oh how i love to be rescued!

"hopefully i remember to stop in 20 minutes. my mind went blank for a sec. what should i write about, what am i thinking about. what is this group's name, the group who sings ""what's my age again. "" it's blink 182. just thinking about the song, singing it in my head. should i go ahead and write the lyrics down since it's in my head? keep on singing the song. now i'm pondering about what i should write and think. i hate this song, christina aguilera's ""genie in a bottle. "" my is thinking what to think so that i can type it down. my mind is completely blank, i have no thought or feeling whatsoever. now the room is getting cold. i can feel goosebumps forming. i'm singing the song i don't like. i was thinking that thank goodness i'm not working tomorrow morning. my eyes are beginning to hurt from staying glued onto the computer. i wonder is it time yet? another song is playing, and again i'm singing to it. singing the song. come on, think of something so that i can type it down. thinking of what i need to do tomorrow: go to co-op and return my books before it's too late to get a full refund on books. i have to meet with my sister so that i can get her some food. i also need to go this store so that i can buy a new pair of sandals since the ones i have right now are getting ready to tear on me. it's located behind einsten's bagel store. my mind is drifting back to the song. i think the music is distracting me from thinking. all i can think are the lyrics of the song and nothing else unless i make myself think of something. now another song is playing, but i forget who sang it. the name of the song is ""how's it going to be. "" trying to think of the artist who sings this song. i can't seem to think of the artist's name, but i know it, it's like it's on the tip of my tongue. i know it, but can't say it. i hate that feeling. my mind is once again blank. i'm thinking about the mall. because today we went to the mall. i'm now thinking about the topic of this writing assignment, am i doing it correctly? hopefully. how long do i have to go now? just thinking about the meeting that our dorm is to have concerning with sex since the radio had said something dealing with sex. i'm now making myself think of things. so i'm thinking of when i'm going to go back home. i'm thinking about wanting to go shopping. i'm thinking about the allegations i've read in the daily texan on gap. about how the were alleged to using sportshops. i'm thinking that if the allegations are true, will i continue to shop there. i'm thinking about the m&m commercial, the latest one, since i thought i heard something similiar to that on the radio. i was thinking of something, but was unable to type it down, wasn't fast enough. thinking of the song that is now pllaying, tlc's ""unpretty. "" is time yet? feels like 20 minutes is forever and endless. when is this over. found out that i have one minute leftover. feel like just stopping since it's only one minute. reminiscing about my chat with my friend through the aol instant messaging. i think it's time. time now. yes, i'm done.

"today has been a pretty uneventful and boring day. i've been to two of my three classes today. i was starting to fall asleep in my stats class. it's my most boring class of the day. i still have to go to my rhetoric class. it's pretty boring too. i'm not a very good writer at all. i don't much enjoy going to class. i don't apply myself to school near as much as i should. i say i'm going to study but then i put it off until the last second. i guess there are a lot of people that do too. i'm pretty bad though. i don't study hardly at all and make b's and c's. i don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but i do feel stupid for not studying and trying. then i could get all a's and b's. i'm a pretty laid back guy. things don't bother me very easily. but when they do, i can't get them off my mind until their resolved. i live with three other guys. they can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. i have a girlfriend that i've been with for a year and a half. we don't fight very much. she gets mad at me a lot more than i get mad at her. she never use to get mad at me. but then a few weeks before i moved down to austin she started. i think it's because she had stay home and finish school and i got to come down to austin and experience new things. i feel that i don't love her as much as i use to. my twenty minutes is up so i'm going to go to english. this wasn't as bad as i had thought it would be.

" i'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because i attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59. very ironic. i feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. i have a lot to do and i don't feel like doing anything. i wish i could just go to sleep. i need a lot of attention from people these days and i'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and i'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe i'm just overreacting though, because i seem to do that so well. i don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and i smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. i have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5. i don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully i will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. i need to realize that i can make myself happy and i don't need someone else to make me happy. i don't even know why i'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head i suppose. i hope i get a new car. my dad said i can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. it will probably be something crappy like i have now. but i can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue i was starting to stress that i was going to get too far behind. i really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though i do try but i need more. i need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that i might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. i might stay at the appartment tonight but i probably won't because i have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens i suppose. i think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like i said i'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. i'm so tired right now i could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but i can't do that because i have entirely too much work to do. tonight i want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and i want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. i hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but i'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. i'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. i don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. i just hope it counts to him. oh well. i met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and i hope i get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. i'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san marcos and go see some people that i haven't seen in a long time. i hope i can scrounge up something to wear, because i need to do laundry and i need to go shopping, i have like no clothes anymore, i don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if i see her this weekend. i hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. i don't know what but i don't really like it. i'd rather just stay here and study or like watch tv then go home and feel awkward with my family. i have so much to do and i'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. i can already see that college is going to be very hectic. i hope i can handle it alright. wow the time is up.

"dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream-- probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people i know really are, and especially the way that i feel about those people deep inside. i don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, i might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who i am. sometimes i admit that i am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes i admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things i didn't think i could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that i can feel for days. a lot of times i say that i am by nature an independent person, i work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but i'm not one of them. i do need my family and close friends-- i couldn't even think about living without them. but how would i be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but i have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again i guess for some ""lucky"" people they will never be left alone. i think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who i am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. i need to be my own person before i can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and i try to be, just not easily influenced. i try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that: though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself.

" the first thing that comes to mind is that when i do these things i don't know what to write. i just sit trying to think of things to write. this to me is like one of those awkward situations like when you are with someone you don't know and have to make small talk. this is like tring to think of something to say to that person the only thing is, is that your the only person here trying to think of something to say to the computer. another thought popped into my head and that is that i don't know what to do in my speech class. i have to give an interview to someone and be interviewed by someone and i have no idea on what i want to do with that. i had an idea and the professor was going down the list of names asking us what we were going to do ours on and i had an idea and the girl before me took my idea so now i am left here with no thoughts on what to do in this situation. i will just have to go on and think of something else to do on this project, athough i am not to really worried about it. i wonder if while doing this writing experiment that the reader ever takes into consideration that some people might have periods where they just don't think about basicly anything. that they are just in a daze where no clear thought comes into their mind and they have absolutely nothing to talk about. i was just wandering. now a song that i hate has just come on that i heard for the first time while i was visiting for the first time that part the family that you don't talk about because they are imberasing. i don't think i spelled that word right, but anyway it was in arkansas and i don't plan on ever going back there again. now another song i hate has come on but i am in a delimma because of this contineous writing thing i can move my fingers to change the station. i now looked up at the clock seeing that i only have three minutes left and this is not as hard as i thought it was going to be, but my essay has been pretty boring because i am tired and had nothing to talk about. the reason i am so tired is because i have an eighto o' clock clase everyday and it really, really sucks. well, i only have 2 seconds left and actually i would like to talk for a longer period of time but i guess i will talk to myself on paper where you can read at a later time, bye.

"i am sitting at my desk at work. i should be doing other things. i'm angry for having to work today. this should be a day off. i could have taken it off but then i wouldn't get paid. no paid vacation for part time. i am tired even though i got a good amount of sleep last night. i really shouldn't be tired. i don't feel like going to the gym this afternoon but i wil. i go the gym five days a week and i don't know why. i really don't see any real difference in my body. i started going really to improve myself but i have noticed no change in the several months i've been there. never the less i still go everyday. i guess i'm just hoping it will pay off. i would really like a nap. even if i skip the gym and go straight home i can't take a nap. i have homework to do. not really required home work but reading and prepairing for classes this wek. i am realy trying to stay on top of all my classes this semester. if i slakck off i'll have serious problems in some of my courses. i'm not really sure if this is what i should be writing about. i'm just writing about what i'm thinking about as i sit here tyoing away. the more i think about it these are pretty normal thoughts for me. most days i am tired and want to skip going to the gym. and most days i still go to the gym. despite not seeing results i'm not what i would call discouraged. i never think of quiting going to the gym, i just wonder why i see no difference. and everyday i think about all the things i have to do at home that evening. what checks i need to write for bills. i need to write my rent check tonight. i also need to elt my roommates know that the electric and water bill is due soon. i need to change the elevtric and water bil out of my name because i am moving. thats another thing i have to do when i get home tonight. i havve to start deciding waht i can fir into my new apartment and what i have to store or sell. these are all really basic thoughts for me. i'm always thinking ahead and planning what needs to be done at night or tomorrow or nex week etc. i am very organized, maybe too much if there is such a thing. i dion't really know anyone who is as organized as me. my mother doesn't call me organized she calls me controlling and anal retentive. i prefer organized and in control. i'm not always in control, but she doesn't know that. i don't tell her how out of control i feel in my relationship with my boyfriend. this is also another normal daily thought for me. why i stay with someone who doesn't feel the same for me as i do for him. or at least he is not sure. i often wonder if i'm stupid for staying, or is it just him who is tupid because he can't figure out what he wants or what he feels. maybe its both. thinkng about how much time i give to my boyfriend and how to limit that time is also a normal daily thought for me, at least lately. i am a planner, i like to know what the plans are for tonight or tomorrow night or the weekend. he doesn't make plans with anyone until that evening arrives. i've gotten to expect that from him but i can't say i've gotten use to it. i wish he would tell me his plans ahead of time but i know that he won't so i'm learining to adapt. i guess it is probaly good for someone like me to be with someone who makes her just relax. i know that everything doesn't have to be planned but for some reason i do try to plan everything i can. controlling the caos i guess, or to try to control the best i can. i am really out of daily thoughts. i don't know what else to say. writing for twenty minutes straight is hard. my thought are just normal. i am listening to the radio and i don't know this song. not that it matters i just leave the radio on at work for some background noise. oh wait, i do know this song. i just didn't recognize it at first. i have a lot of reading to do tonight that i'm not looking forward to. biology mostly. m developmental calss looks like it will be challenging but possibly very enjoyable. who am i kidding, by the end of the semester very few classes are enjoyable they are just over and i am always glad just to pass. as orgainsed as i am i sometimes feel overwhelmed at the beging of the semester trying to get everything organised and figure out what classes to give studying priority to. i usually study first the class i have next. i will fo home and read biology before i read psychology because i have biology tomorrow and psychology is not until wednesday.

"so i'm suppose to be writing my thoughts at the current moment. hm, strangely enough, i don't have any and usually my head is swarming with random ideas and daydreams. well, now that i think about it, i guess right now my thoughts are so scattered that i can't exactly grasp onto one idea. my friend called while i was in bio class earlier. stupid me forgot to turn off my phone before i went into the class, so imagine the embarrassment when my phone rang in a deathly quiet lecture hall. i quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone, not wanting to upset my professor. typically, i'm told, it's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class. but man, my heart raced after that. i don't know why either. but for about 5 min, i couldn't write; my hand was shaking so bad. so right now, i'm thinking i should call my friend back, but seeing as how i still have about 15 min left to write, i guess i can do that later. speaking of later, i'm still waiting for a phone call from my friend ruby so that we can go work out later. we went earlier this morning, right before lunch, but we had to stop short because i had class and all. we worked out for about an hour, and yet, that was definitely not enough. i never imagined that working out took so long. i'm terrified about the so-called freshman 15 that i want to do as much exercise as possible. it seems like i have so much free time on my hands, since i only have class for about 2-3 hours each day, and yet, i'm still rushing around trying to get everything done. it's funny how time speeds up when you're at college. i still have yet to practice piano here. and i have a billion other things to do, and yet, for some reason, i'm really bored now. my time management skills have definitely got to improve. fast. i also push myself to do something every single minute of the day, because once i start getting bored, then i get really depressed and start missing home. i never thought that would happen because i really hate port lavaca. it was so boring there. man, i'm just filled with surprises. i'm really looking forward to seeing my friend tonight. i can't wait. all my thoughts eventually drift back to him. i've managed to suppress my thoughts about him for about 10 min now. whew, that was really tough work, i must say. we don't see each other all that much during the day, mainly because he's busy, i'm busy, we're all busy. but i guess it's good. we need to lead our own lives, so in case things between us break apart, i won't be totally crushed. like the last time. i learned my lesson quite well. but still, i can't wait to see him. it kinda sucks living at jester without a car. sure i know a lot of people with cars and all, but that's different. i don't want to bother them with taking me places. i had my roommate take me to walmart today and i felt sooooo bad when we came back. i dunno, i just feel like a burden when i don't have a car. i guess i could always call up my bro but he lives about 10 min away and parking on this campus sucks. and usually when i go visit my friend, i get him to pick me up since he lives on the other side of campus and then some. but doing that every day is going to get quite tedious. i'm going to have to find another mode of transportation. i still have to figure out how the buses run too. i'm scared to ride the buses tho. i'm scared that i'll take the wrong one and end up on the 5th ward of austin. i wish i had my car. i've met some new people here, hung out with a lot of old friends too. but yet, i still feel very lonely. i mean, i'm starting to get to know my bro's friends but it's kinda not the same when everyone knows each other so well, and then this newcomer comes and tries to fit in. i guess a lot of freshman go through the same thing. i dunno. maybe it's just me. and wow, this 20 min went by really fast. i have about 4 min left. ok, so what was i saying? o yea, i think tonight i'm going to see my friend. (i told you my thoughts keep drifting back to him) it's his birthday today and his roomies are throwing him a special party, entertainment included. i don't really care about that. and surprisingly enough, i don't even care if he has a bunch of friends that are girls. i guess i'm just in a whatever mode. don't want to get too attached again. but on the other hand, maybe i'm finally beginning to trust him. i guess i'll find out later if that's going to be a huge mistake. i really like writing, esp like this. just random thoughts. i brought up my journal so that when i'm feeling some realy intense emotions, i can just write my little heart out. but that's usually only when i'm really feeling strongly about something. usually when i'm going through one of my personal traumas. ok, time's up. this has truly been fun. truly.

"i have so much reading to do. it seems in all of my classes the professors are overwhelming us with material. but i guess that is to be expected in college, or at least that's what they told us. but i will persevere. i did have above a 100 gpa in high school. so this shouldn't be too hard. but i have to maintain a 4. 0 to please myself. that's attainable too, though. i know myself good enough to know that i will put everything else aside if my grades start to slip. like last night, i really didn't want to stay in, but i had to catch up on a lot of things. yep, i'll definitely maintain. no problem. bye, bye, bye. man, i hate that song. i wish stupid songs wouldn't get stuck in my head. i've always wondered about the stars. i think it would be the ultimate thing to impress a girl if you took her on a picnic and could lay and look at the stars and point out all the constellations. hey, then maybe i should take astrology for my science. after all, i do need two semesters of a science to graduate business honors. but i heard that that class was semidifficult, and i need an easy a in my science class. it can't be that bad though. i mean, after all, how hard can looking at the stars be. but in all sciences, they find ways to talk about stuff that i wouldn't have ever imagined could be taught about. dang, i hate science. all sciences. well, i guess social sciences aren't that bad. but those aren't really sciences. just the basic ones bio, chem. , physics, yeah, can't stand those. all right, only ten minutes left. i would have guessed that in ten minutes i would have thought about more stuff. guess not. what is time? i mean, it is time to us, but why should the universe revolve around humans. i'm sure there are other beings somewhere out there, but we don't have proof. there were those circles in the wheat fields somewhere, but that's not proof. just some stupid iowan rednecks trying to get publicity. just like that kid who is now charging bobby knight with abuse. that's so stupid. just a publicity stunt. it is so apparent to everyone that he didn't do anything wrong. he may have been a little stern in the manner he addressed the kid, but that is nothing that should be brought to the forefront like this. stupid. i can't wait until college basketball starts, that is the best time of year. although i go to ut now, i will always be a duke basketball fan. i have been since i can remember. that's not bad is it? nah. i enjoy college football, but it just isn't the same to me. i guess it's because college basketball has more action, and because the kids actually care. not like the nba. all of them are lazy and just worried about the money, whereas the ncaa the kids play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back. but i guess there are some players who don't do that. oh well, i don't care. bye, bye, bye. dang, stop it. i need to hook up with a girl tonight. i've been here too long not to have yet. it really gets me how people can have random sex. i'm quite proud to be a virgin, and i will be until i get married. and i know that god will keep me strong. like my roommate. i just don't understand. bye, bye, bye. all right. this thing is finally over. one less thing i have to worry about.

""black magic woman"" is playing on the radio. i like this song. it reminds me of my mom because she has the record from when she was a santana fan. the artwork on the cover of the album is really beautiful. there is a red winged creature on the cover and a lot of complex looking designs and a million different colors and stars and growing things. it looks like the night. today in class i was about to fall asleep. i looked over at aisha and she was practically dead. i don't think it was because the class wasn't interesting but because it was just the time of day when i feel really tired and i can't really think of anything. when i walk around i feel really relaxed, not at all anxious, and it's kind of pleasant. it reminds me of this boy that works nights, and he would hardly ever sleep and it was kind of nice to be around him because there wasn't a whole lot going on. we would just sit around listening to music or watching things. when he's not tired he talks a lot, and it kind of drives me crazy sometimes. he just talks about cars a lot and how things work and scientific stuff, and he's very passionate about those kind of things. i saw him on monday and he told me he loved me, and it was so weird. i don't know where that is going. i've known him forever, and i think of him as a person that i can really trust and talk to things about. he reminds me of my father in some ways because my dad always talked a lot sometimes about things that didn't interest me very much but i liked him anyway. i liked how fat he was. it makes me laugh. he was a rather large man and he had really hairy arms like a bear. for some reason i think it's kind of funny to look back on this but maybe it's because i'm kind of tired although i shouldn't be because i've been getting plenty of sleep lately. i wake up in the mornings, and i have this feeling like i just can't wait to get out of the room and walk around, get some fresh air and get out of this little room which i have to share with another person and deal with all her stuff and everything. she's really nice though. i think i might have offended her yesterday because we were talking about genesis, which we both have to read for our literature class, and i have a lot of questions about what it means and why it's so sacred and important and why god does all the weird stuff that he does in the book. i can't understand why he forbids people to eat the fruit or why he tells people to name their children certain things or why he appears and fights with jacob. it's pretty messed up if you ask me. how am i supposed to believe in that stuff? it's nuts. i just want to be a good person like my mom. she always helps other people and thinks about others. when my dad was dying, she held everyone together and probably saved me along with everyone else. i don't think i would still be alive without my mom. she's really religious and perfect in most ways. i wish nathanael were here. he makes me feel better about things most of the time even though he weird me out at times. i wish i could go driving out in the country or even for a walk. i grew up on a farm, and i love open fields and fish and cows and crap like that. it's unfortunate because i can't imagine living anywhere else but in the country even though it is lonely at times. it is so peaceful and beautiful at night. one night nathanael and i stayed up all night and watched the sun rise. we were sitting on his truck. that was the night before i went to germany for 3 weeks to visit my best friend who lives there now. i love her so much. she was one of the few people that i ever thought was really like me. she was an incredible artist, and she inspired me to take up drawing and painting. my dad was an artist too. i have one drawing of his on my room at home. he liked to do cartoons and make corny jokes. he was so wonderful with people, and everyone loved him. sometimes i imagine what it would be like if he just walked into the room right now and how i would feel about seeing him after all this time. for i second i feel so excited, but then i realize that it could never happen. it is the most horrible feeling to know that you will never again see someone that you love so much, especially someone that you admired and tried to make yourself like them.

" urg! there is sand in my sandal. it's been there for a while now. it was so annoying that i had to take my shoes off while i was driving home from my horrendously long art class today. i had to wait for half an hour for that stupid bus. it was at least 6:45 by the time i reached my stop. you'd think that rush hour would be over by then. it wasn't. i sat in traffic from enfield all the way out past the y at 290. that is just insane. i was stuck behind a maroon jeep cherokee with a gore'liberman bumpersticker on it for most of the way. but that guy exited when i got to the 290'mopac split. then i was confused as a white rav 4 started diving through lanes into spaces too absurd to drive in. it was quite odd and annoying all at the same time. then i was almost cut off by a stupid woman in a red mini-van and her punk looking son. i'll just say this: i was ready for this day to end at about 2:00 this afternoon. now it's getting cold in here. my dad's office is always cold. of course, his computer is always on. it's a giant that's hardly ever used. shame really. so my feet are starting to get quite chilly. more of the usual discomfort. the smell in here is rather interesting. it smells like candy. cherry candy to be precise. for a moment i thought my boyfriend might be eating some of the lollypops my dad always has on his desk. he wasn't though. odd. it's really not that usual for an automotive shop office to be smelling like candy. there are too many boxes at my feet. it's hard to get comfortable with all of them at my feet. i keep mentioning my feet. why is that? they're uncomfortable, that could be one reason. i feel bad because i have been sort of brusque with my boyfriend. here he is, come all the way from across town just to see me and i can't even spare him five minutes before i launch into my homework. i think i'll give him a hug now. just a minute. i think he appreciated that. it was a necessary break in my stream of consciousness. he gives so much of his time to me, the least i can do is give him some back in return. sometimes i wonder why he is so loyal. i tend to rush past him when i'm doing something or i overlook him when he wants my attention. he really dosen't deserve that. he's such a nice person. i always tell him that i'm a mean person and that he would be better off with someone prettier and nicer. he just smiles and hugs me and tells me there is no one better. i have my doubts, but i really don't think i'd give him up if someone better were to come along. i'd fight to the death to keep him. that's how much i love him. i'm a very jealous person. i'm stingy with my boyfriend and i'm stingy with my friends. i don't like anyone being around him (mostly females) if i'm not there too. i know i shouldn't be so difficult, but it's not really something i have any conscious control over. i don't like my sister being around my friends either. i hate sharing friends with her. she's younger than i am and she has her own friends to hang out with. i don't bother her friends, why should she bother mine? i'm beginning to wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over for me to wash it. i've been needing to do laundry for a while now. there's charcoal stains all over my shorts, and i've run out of spiffy t- shirts to wear, so it's off to the wash. i don't know whether or not i'll have time to do it all tomorrow as i had hoped. i also need to pay a visit to my old high school tomorrow. i've promised my friend katy i would visit. there's really only three teachers i want to see: mr. meitz (physics), mrs. hebert (english, creative writing), and mr. dennis (newspaper). the trinity of great teachers. and with all great figures there has to be a devil . mine is mr. austin, my art teacher for three years. i looked up to him as a mentor and he turned his back on me at the end of my senior year. i was crushed. still i wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over. he's really not the most hygenic person in the whole world. i've had friends tell me that he's lucky to have me because he's too disgusting to date other women. i don't have a problem with him. sure he tends to go three or four days between showering, three or four weeks between laundry cleanings, and three of four months between room organizing, but i love him anyways. and besides, i've been know to go a day or two or three between showers. all this talking about him makes me want to hug him again. i think i will. once again, just a moment. okay, i'm done. i keep hearing the sound of a little red desiel isuzu outside. there are no windows in here, so i really can't see. very strange indeed. my hands are starting to cramp. my wrists are aching and my fingertips are numb. it's a leathal combination of the extremely powerful air conditioner and all this typing. my hands are starting to look cold too. when my hands are cold they get a little paler. even a little yellow. did i mention that my neck hurts too? it does. my butt is doing nicely, though. must be this comfy chair. my dad bought it at the bombay company for his birthday. it's really nice. sometimes i wonder if i have a brain tumor. there are times when i forget simple things, or i get simple things confused. i really hope i don't have one. i'm planning to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend. i suppose i should really call him my fiancee. yes, that works. we're going to be married on february 5, 2006. it's going to be marvelous. we're going to have platinum puzzle rings made for our wedding bands. why puzzle rings? because we exchanged our own special puzzle rings as marks of our engagements. i don't know if i would call it official or not. we haven't formally announced it to our parents. mine already know i'm not leaving him. i half think my mother wishes i would. my dad likes him, though. that's always a good sign. there is a gigantic printer seated on the desk beside me. it's a monstrous beast of a machine. it's actually a printer, fax, copier, scanner all in one. great piece of machinery, really. i don't want to do the dishes that are waiting down at the house. i had a long day filled with the joys of muenstral cramps, and i'm really not up to the task. i hope someone does them before i finish all this. i have five younger sisters, three of which are at the dishwashing age. you'd think one of them would do them. still, i have an ominous feeling that i will be burdened with the chore as i am burdened with so many other things. sometimes i can't stand my family. fortunately, my step-mother is no longer part of that life. i should really be calling her what she now is: my father's ex-wife. that fits so much better. i'm just glad she's gone. life would be much more hectic with her still here. she's a bi-polar wrech who refuses to take her pills. did i mention that she cheated on my father when they were married? one more reason for me to despise her. i despise any person who cheats on their spouse or partner or whatever you want to call the person you are in some way or another bonded to. it may not be a happy bond, but theres nothing that excuses cheating in my eyes. i will never cheat on my fiancee and i hope to god that he never cheats on me. i would be crushed. i've been watching that timer like a hawk since i started. i'm so tired of typing that it hurts. literally. but with a minute and a half left, i must press on. ha! it's a pun and i didn't even realize it! i'm so clever. some would argue that point, but i still think i have my shining moments. everybody needs their shining moments. without shining moments, we're just dull. afterall, what's the opposite of shiny? dull. i never want to be dull. i'm certain that people already find me dull, but as long as i don't know about it, it's all good. i just hope they never say it to my face. that would make me either sad or mad. i guess it depends on the weather that day. but people who know me don't think i'm dull. at least i hope not. i just don't like waiting all afternoon for a bus that takes thirty minutes to run. and you can quote me on that one. so there. yep.

i don't really know what i should write about. i guess i'm feeling alright. my class was cancelled for today so i had the whole day off. i rented sling blade which i liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. the keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever i try to push it down. i am kind of nervous about classes because last semester i screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 4. 0 gpa for 2 and 1'2 semesters. i have never taken psychology before in high school and i wish i had since it would make the class easier now when i take it. i really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so i keep having to stop and think of something to type. one of my goals this semester is to stop watching tv so often because that is what i feel screwed me up last semester since i was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. now i beginning to feel a little grossed out because i was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. i guess it has been about twenty minutes now i forgot what time i started typing at since i forgot to write it down i thought i would have remembered. so i'm just going to call it a night. ,0,1.071895 -0.03634 -1.268649 -0.162279 0.095069 -2.277701 1.715298 1.100969 1.690925 -1.374283 -0.009706 -0.590446 2.138902 0.701189 1.117905 0.0 -0.04277 -0.255485 -0.253995 0.247794 -0.201255 -0.742368 -0.381252 -0.729722 0.551044 0.573779 1.180757 1.365696 -0.544771 -1.089114 -0.331597 -0.68018 0.412032 0.003227 1.454843 -1.109326 0.014579 1.909322 -0.883121 -1.159544 1.447447 -0.596309 0.075039 0.451044 -0.727057 0.196264 1.576322 -0.356752 0.531977 -0.657705 0.854299 4.370491 1.026253 -0.603588 -1.236697 0.68996 0.823353 3.214502 -1.652329 -2.042709 -0.512082 -0.281449 -0.480161 1.044334 2.123063 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.913602 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.896433 -0.451544 0.179788 -1.720231 4.344767 3.689429 4.362338 4.715898 4.759512
"it's three thirty in the afternoon right now, and i'm working on my psychology homework. this is a very interesting assignment; i've never done one quite like this. it's actually quite easy--just putting my thoughts on this site and having it timed. quite fascinating. i'm excited today because i finally got my internet and cable installed!! it's been almost 2 weeks since i've been able to watch tv on my own and to use my own internet to get online!! i don't know how i made it, but i'm still alive. hehe. i'm glad that the time-warner people finally got the address right. the first time they came, the went to the wrong apartment complex!! how aggravating!! i've never been more miserable in my entire life!! but today, i'm feeling competely opposite!! ahh. the joys of modern technology. right now, my desk is hurting my arms. since i'm typing, the fleshy part of my arm is getting pushed into the edge of the desk, thus creating a groove in my skin which is sometimes painful. other than that, i'm ok. oh, but my chair is also making impressions on the back of my leg. i'm wearing shorts now so the back of my legs have a cloth pattern on them. my computer is working fine right now, which i am very grateful for. my friend stephen just instant messenged me, but i can't really reply back to him right now since i am doing this writing assignment, which is timed. i feel like i am writing a lot, but perhaps it is because i type fast. hmm. could be. well, i seem to be making many typos. i guess i should slow down and think of what i am writing before i write it. i sometimes get ahead of myself when i am thinking of what to write and it wreaks havoc on my typing. twenty minutes is a long time if you think about it. i mean, i've typed all of this in just seven minutes and twenty three seconds. i'm also trying to figure out which of my friends i should call to help me with the downloading of music. it's the greatest thing on the internet, but somehow i can't get it to work as efficiently as they can. all they have to do to play a song is click the list of songs that they have on the side of their screen, but when i want to play a song, i have to pull up a separate folder. bleh!! so i need to call one of my friends. but who should i call?? let's see. there's stephen, who im'ed me, rex, maria, sarika (she's going home this weekend though), mitra, lindsay (or is it -ey?), maria, her boyfriend zack, her boyfriend's friend stephen, ha, tahera, or jessica. i'm sure i know more people, but i can't think of them right now. the sad thing with the people i just listed is that almost all of them went to the same high school as i did. i need to meet new people. i can't hang out with the same few people every single day. but it's so hard to meet people when the classes have hundreds of people in them each. i go to class sitting next to a different person every single time. i rarely see the same person in my classes. i guess that's what i get for taking all the introductory classes. this stream of consciousness thing is cool. i'm thinking about my syntax (haha. such an ap english 4 word) and it's weird. i never normally talk like this. i feel as though i am babbling to myself or trying to sound intelligent as i babble. i guess i don't talk in an ignorant way, but i feel as though i sound more sophisticated than i really sound in real life. so i might go see a movie with my friends next friday entitled one hour photo. the ever so famous robin williams is in the movie, along with the very appealing guy from the hit show alias, michael vartan. the show alias is really cool--this girl named sydney, played by jennifer garner, is this spy'counterspy and she does all this cool stuff with all her high tech gadgets. and michael vartan plays her handler. now i'm talking on the phone with my friend maria. she called about what we want to do tonight. so we might play monopoly. apparently rex brought monopoly. or maybe it's rex who has it. i don't know. all i know is that now i have to call rex and see if he wants to play monolopy after his chinese bible study thing. i went to this chinese'taiwanese association thing the other night, and i felt so white-washed. that means that i don't feel like i'm as asian as them. i guess that could be a bad thing, but it probably was because half of those people were fobbish. fobbish means that they just got to the states so they're still really foreign-like. it kind of makes them stand out, but if they're ok with it, then it doesn't matter. i'm almost finished!! woohoo!! now i have to go call rex and see what we're doing tonight. good bye!

"i am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that i have in 40 minutes. the class in which i have not attended yet due to a schedule change. i hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that i won't have too much catching up to do. i hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days i'm going to be out of town. i've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because i will be out of town for my sister's wedding. i wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. i hope everything works out for her. i wonder if the person i marry i already know, or if i have yet to meet them. i need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes i added'dropped, i need to do this soon. i hope that when i have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since i've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because i'll get to see my sister who i haven't seen in a very long time. i need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but i'm afraid if i commit to it i won't have enough time to study. also, i'm going to miss 5 days of tryouts because i'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. i need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before i have to leave for philosophy. i hope i like this class, or else i switched out of sociology for nothing.

"they are playing the atlanta braves. they're good but i think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. there closing pitcher, something like, lightenburg is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to randy johnson of the astros. i'm really hungry right now. i want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in houston. houston has the best restaurants. the night before i came to school i went to anthony's in houston. i had duck with cherry dressing. it was so good and the dessert was even better. we ordered practically everything on the menu. school is really different from high school. there is so much freedom compared to high school. not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. my bed is so comfortable. i put my two twin beds together and now i have a king sized bed. i love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in austin. i love ut and i cannot wait until the first football game even though i am leaving town. i am going to birmingham for my grandmother's 80th birthday. it will be good to see my parents again. my sister is a senior at ut this year and she is going to graduate in the spring. she is a pr major. this summer she interned for your daughter at pennebaker designs. well i think that is 20 minutes so i am going to stop. i think i am going to go get something to eat. pizza or maybe some quesadillas.

(and my roommate asks ""so you just write? anything? crazy dude"") wow. i thought at least something would come but er. never mind. i do not know really what to write about. great and only a minute and a half into it. er. hrm, maybe write about this computer, or the fact that i do not have one yet. that sucks. in college and i have to either go to a lab or use someone else's computer while constantly i see others around on their own machines. i have a phone call! yay. my 'mentor' telling me about an event in front of ecj. weird trying to type and talk at the same time about two completely off different things. eh. phone's off. coming on five minutes now. almost. so i was early. you know this can't all be that interesting typing for a solid twenty minutes. most of these papers must be extremely boring. unless someone goes off and just starts telling a story or something. hrm, sounds like maybe something to do. well, it all began a long time ago. well, long in the sense that they were young when it began; that time period to others may just be what they consider a few years or so. (did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window. very annoying i must say) (i need a name. er, samsung monitor, ok the character's name is sam) sam had been a small child when his father disappeared, therefore he had little memory of him. all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park. nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like. many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person, constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting, except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do. they also told him of when his father was younger; he would disappear for days on end, supposedly off camping or exploring by himself, and would return different. how different, they could not quite say, but something changed in him. , not always for the better. often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks, but after time, he would return to his energetic self. (i notice i seem to misspell quite a bit and even though i try to catch and fix the word as i type it, some words do get through without my notice and i'd rather not go back and change them. also i tend not to capitalize much when typing. this is probably due to the fact that i have grown to accustomed to writing in word and it will capitalize certain things automatically; that and i am usually too lazy to remember to do so. ) after sam's father disappeared the last time, his mother fell into a strange illness. there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness. it was as if something from another world. something definitely there but not ",1,0.075028 -1.407239 -0.888534 -1.483263 -1.64821 -0.392935 1.694726 0.9685 1.523241 -0.38218 -0.187326 0.033302 0.72443 -0.000308 0.51455 0.0 -0.04277 -0.986594 -2.519102 -0.795527 -2.872078 0.90318 1.821511 1.765787 0.647768 0.241852 0.395321 -0.003986 -1.211808 -1.130364 -1.100231 -0.618388 -0.515291 -0.906028 -0.348874 -0.664938 0.097227 -1.385622 -0.219267 0.301317 0.306681 1.976821 1.698727 0.292949 -1.049385 2.221446 -0.732292 1.630968 2.251109 1.555762 -0.75137 1.014969 0.798738 -1.084508 -0.194618 0.256957 -0.528949 3.557639 -0.16435 1.902671 0.893267 0.183902 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.065224 4.333865 -0.086094 0.189436 0.342281 -0.073676 2.717573 0.045035 -0.150446 -0.337085 0.402734 -0.832358 3.860881 0.86524 0.260418 3.850283 3.751615 4.234668 4.211665 5.376469

(not really-which i should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all i can do is sing them over and over again. also i sometimes translate them into french. it always seems like i've accomplished something after i've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least i have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what i type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. i think i need to hear the new sundays cd, it sounds really good, at least the one song that i've heard from it. i haven't bought a cd in a few weeks now, my last one being an older poi dog pondering cd that i like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately i only have two minutes left. i wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. i know you can type longer, and i'd love to, except i have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that i have available. so now i'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 60,549. 58,47. 56,55,54,53. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only i couldn't really count down and type at the same time, i'll try again with the ten key. 60,590,58,57,56,55,545,53,52,52, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now i've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you.

" so right now i'm trying to hold myself together. i have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. i recently tryed out for texas sirits and shockingly i made the first cut. wow, out of 300 girls i was one of the eighty to be chosen. the bad news is that i have to do another creative project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. i hate money. people always say, money can't by you happiness but i beg to differ. if you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 10 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. it really is the little things for me though. i would like that extra size ice-cream. or another ut t-shirt. however, mr. budget steps in {a good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra perks of life. i'm sure i'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. ramen noddeles would go out of bussines. taco bell would close down. and sadly second hand stores would be no more. wow i really need to finish my project! its due in a couple of min. i feel like i'm allways rushing around. my life is one big traffic jam. how is this? maybe i take on too much. but other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. i wonder if people think i'm in control? ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! ok is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.

"the weekend was nice. an old family friend came up to visit. i've known him since 3rd grade i think? something like that. bowling. bumming around. gaming. pool. eating. etc etc. was fun. now back to class after a long weekend. ugh. these classes aren't very interesting. but that's ok. it's just basic sequence right now. once i start taking major sequence classes. i think it will become more interesting. these classes just seem like a hassle. i never liked writing assignments. mostly because i've never been a strong writer. i'm not very skilled at thinking of what to write. words never seem to flow. i don't know. i really wonder what i'll do with my life. biomedical engineering sounds all fancy and stuff. but will it really provide me with a decent life in the future? i really don't know. it doesn't seem like there's much flexibility with this major. i do take cem, phys, bio courses and stuff. so it seems like my work covers over areas from different majors. i guess i'll have a wide variety of knowledge. but i won't be an expert in any of the areas. plus with competition from foreign sources. the future scares me even more. i guess i do get somewhat bitter when i think about how researchers may earn something like 40-50k a year. but then the mba that hired them gets 100+ perhaps? that's just bs. i don't think it's very fair at all. but nothing's ever very fair. man. i really want a job. i have time i guess. but no transportation. and then not all the jobs i've looked through were at the right times. i applied for something at the lan cave in jester. i hope i get that. then i need to start looking for scholarships. internships. summer research. etc etc etc. oh yeah. i need to look for an apartment for next year. i really don't want to end up in the dorms again. as much as i like the fast internet. i really want a room of my own. and the freedom that comes with living in a place of your own. i guess it is pretty free in the dorms. but i can't blast the music when i want to. or turn up the volumes for gaming. besides. blanton isn't really the best dorm out there either. not having a sink in the room really sucks. it's not a big deal to walk to the bathroom. but for stuff like making ramen. a quick wash of the face. or maybe just a drink of cool water. i have to make a trip. i guess i'm just lazy. but it's odd that some dorms have sinks in the room and others don't. only ten minutes have passed. feels like a lot more than that. time passes slowly when you're not having much fun. i like seeing things animated. or in motion. sitting and writing. or reading. they're not that interesting. i do like reading about computer technology and astronomy and cars and stuff. but it's hard to make myself sit down and read a book like harry potter. i haven't done that in years. yeah. i don't think i've willingly read a fiction book since middle school. i remember those redwall and mossflower books. i guess they were the trend back in the day. i signed up for the 3rd coast gaming competition later this month. aiya. i'm a bit worried. playing at the arcades isn't like playing on a console. the controls feel different. plus. when i play at the arcades. i get beaten a lot. i guess it kind of hurts my confidence. but that's ok. i'll just see how i match up with the other people in the competition. besides. it's only $10. and i think it'll be fun to watch the l337 play. i could really go for a huge huge glass of orange juice right now. maybe some pluckers wings too. i don't know. what should i write about. ""anything at all"". it's so vague. i like having a little more of an idea of what i'm doing. *shrug*. oh well. don't use this as a cry for help huh. i don't really cry out for help. well. not in very noticeable ways. keeping secrets hurts you huh. i guess i've probably shortened my life a lot then. aiya. being asian. that's my excuse. the guy isn't really supposed to show weakness. heh. what a stupid way of thinking. but after 18 years. it's hard to break the habit. i wonder how people can be so carefree. i hope the year goes well. i really do. too much tension everywhere. i really just want to break lose and forget all the responsibilities i have. but i don't think i can. it's just not something i'd do. i'm tired. i need to find something. someone amazing. i don't want to just cruise through life.

"i am going home for the weekend, and i'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. i miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. i mean, i'm not sad or anything, but i really cannot wait to get there. i'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at ut. memories of high school, things i did, things i said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, i often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. i think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where i want to be right now, most of the days, that's where i'd like to be. i think about the solos i took on various songs, the ideas i came up with, and the ones i'm coming up with now; i wish i could be in it to play them, i whistle and hum the different rhythms that i would play, my friend and i try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. i also am thinking about my family and friends, how i miss them, and how i'm going to them this weekend. i think of how i want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. i'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not i will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, i think about my sister in houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how i'm going to corpus this weekend. but i know that we'll see each other soon. i think about my room at home. the food i'm used to eating in corpus, how i really want to eat there because i'm tired of this dorm food. i try to remember as much about home as i can, but there always seems to be more that i think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when i was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. i just can't wait to be there, and i can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. i also think about my classes here, how i'm wondering how i'm going to do in them, if i'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. i hope that i will do good on my first tests, and i hope that the semester is not too hard as long as i study and keep up with everything. i think of my classes at high school, whether i was that smart or not, i wonder if i'm smart enough to be an engineer, i hope that i do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like i'm stupid or something. i think all of these thoughts right now, and like i said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like i'm thinking about everything at the same time, and i guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while i think about everything i can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph.

"well i guess my first thought would be that i don't think the assignment is really fair. i don't really mind it but the fact is that people who type faster will in fact have to write more. i type quite well so this applies to me. i don't really know what else to say so i guess i will just talk. i am 18 i don't like things. i don't like a lot of things. i am very judging of people and things. everywhere i go i am sizing things up. i don't know why i do this, perhaps it is some sort of defense mechanism that i use to protect myself. i don't know once again. i have a girlfriend of seven months who has actually helped me with this very much. just the thought of her brings me comfort and calms me down considerably. i don't sleep very well anymore. i used to sleep quite well but now that all of these changes in my life have occurred i am having trouble adjusting. one thing i have noticed about myself just now is that i complain a lot. well, i noticed it before now but this helps. i will try to be more positive for the rest of the time. i like things. i like a lot of things. i like music, especially the dave matthew's band. i am going to go to a concert of theirs in dallas of friday. i am really looking forward to it. i come from a great family. my parents are one of the few couples in the world today who are still married. i like other things too, just let me think for a second. i like birds. birds are the luckiest animal on earth. they get to fly around all day and laugh at people. my philosophy professor stated a quote from a book about utilitarianism. it said that no intelligent human, no matter how unhappy he or she is would rather be an animal with infinite animal pleasures. i would have to disagree with this statement because i think if given the chance i would be a bird. maybe i would even be a flying squirrel. i also like movies. i watch them all the time. i used to rent like six a night from the video store but i am really lazy. i sleep late and don't return them on time. i therefore incur late fees. i know what is going on though with this whole return them by noon bit. they know people like me won't wake up by twelve so they will rake in the late fees. they pawn this off as a bonus because you are getting twelve extra hours of movie watching time when in fact all you are getting is twenty or so dollars in late charges. i am aware of many scams. i don't really want to go into them right now because i am afraid of what the proponents of such scams will do to me if i reveal their secret. that last line wasn't true. i made it up. this is a trait i picked up from my friend who moved to texas tech. we would all sit around talking and making up elaborate, obviously fake stories just to make each other laugh. so in the memory of my old friend i hope that made you laugh. my twenty minutes are now up so i hope you enjoyed my train of thought. i'm not sure if this is what i was supposed to do but i guess it doesn't matter since it is a completion grade. so i must say goodbye for now. peace.

"although, i constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, i failed to do so. recently, i have noticed a drastic change in my life. prior to the major transition of my life (college), i used to constantly worry. worry. worry. although i still worry, i have learned to view life from another perspective. each and every minute i must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. i realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. for instance, i was watching a movie last night (something i rarely do because i feel i am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. very few movies make me think long after i finished watching the movie, but this one did. the overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. all in all, i am trying to stress that i am still learning regardless of what i do. this certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. today, i have several things to do. my priority list is very long, but i am limited with time. it seems the more i think about how much i have to do, the less time i have to do it. i have two tests next week. chemistry and calculus, respectively. my weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. austin, or rather ut, is a very convenient campus. opposed to my hometown, ut allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. this form of transportation is very tempting! i just bought a laptop which i am very excited about. i felt rushed when i bought it, but it is too late now. i still have to buy a pc card for it so i can access the internet from my dorm. i want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but i have so many things on my mind. by the time i get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!! my life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. but, i enjoy it! i am confused on what organizations i should join here at ut. i am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything i am offered. here at ut, i am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything i want to join. i hope that i will gradually reach the peak i was at in high school. i am sure i will. i was unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. i believe i have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.

"what is love of an emotional basis? how do you know you are in love? is there a boundary to love? are there limits? many people ask these questions, including myself, but cannot find an answer to these questions. i believe that this can only be found out by experience, where you test these limits and grow by it. i have noticed in my personal life that i grow emotionally and mentally each time i find a new partner. love must be a learning experience right? it seems to be that way. i was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school, were i felt as if i was in love with this girl. we took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have. but this form of love seemed to build so quickly. as i looked back at the letters we wrote each other, it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two. how cold that be? does love come at once, or does it grow on you? nine months later, we ended our relationship. it seemed to be the most painful event i had experienced. i next felt like i loved a girl i barely knew. we dated, but nothing came of this, however the crummy feeling you feel after a relationship is over lasted almost a half year. how could someone i just dated for a span of a month create such an effect on me? by my senior year, sometime in january, i became interested in another girl. by this time i had felt that i had grew and i would be able to make this girl happy, and would not make he same mistakes i did with the last girls. as time passed my love grew for this girl, something i had not felt in so long and so strongly. eventually (1 year and 1 month) things deteriorated. how could i have let this love slip? i thought i had mastered the relationship sector of my life. during the summer i met a new girl, whom i am currently with. i don't want to make the same mistake i have before but is it inevitable. will this relationship be like the others, or will i love her stronger than the other girl?

"right now i am sitting by the phone debating on whether or not i should call this guy who is both my friend and currently the guy i have a crush on. he lives in katy so i miss him a lot. i also have this nervous'excited feeling. i can feel my heart race. i tried calling earlier and talked to his dad - i think. i don't know what to do! my roommate just walked in and smells nice because she just took a shower - reminding me that i still have to shower sometime tonight. i keep thinking about all the things i still have to do tonight - like shower, read for journalism, read for art history, back my bag, someday soon wash some clothes, and maybe clean up a little. just random things but i don't have much time because my roommate goes to bed early and i'm such the night person. getting up is a pain in the ass though. those 8am classes are hard. i'm so tempted to skip but i never will because school is important to me and especially my parents! what a mess of papers on my bed! too much to do and too lazy to do it. i just thought about my email. i love email. i check it all the time and am so disappointed when there is nothing new. i had a crazy email crisis this morning. i hit the wrong key and sent all my mail and a folder to the trash can. what a scare! i recovered it though but was almost late to art class. now i can't help but think what to write next. i am still thinking about the phone as time goes by because i have to call - if i am going to call - before 10 pm. i guess i won't call tonight because it will probably just stress me out or bother me. i am done with class by 12:30 tomorrow so i will call late in the day. i miss him and worry about him and so desperately want to see him. he makes me feel so comfortable and always makes me laugh. i can't open up with many people as easily as i can with him. i miss him and wish i could might more people like him. i just don't know where i stand with him and i wish i did. i worry now that time to stop approaches if i said enough because i type rather slow but i did put honesty and effort into this. it is weird opening up for this assignment.

" how i am feeling right now is interesting. i have slept so long for the past few days. i think that it could be that i just moved here from corpus christi, texas. walking all over the campus is extremely exhausting and tiring. however, this weekend i did not walk a whole lot. i have just been sleeping so much. i think that it could be that i miss my mother or family and my body could be going through some sort of physical depression. that, i have no idea about. i do feel that i am getting sick. i have had a minor soar throat the past two days, and i am upset with myself because i forgot to bring my vitamin c chewable tablets. i really like the cherry flavored ones because they taste so much better than the orange flavored ones. i know that you can only purchase the ones that i like at sunharvest. i am not even sure if there is a sunharvest here in austin. i do have a large gallon of orange juice, so i will just drink a whole bunch of that until i start feeling better. or at least until i get paid so i can buy my vitamin c pills. i just got finished taking the pretest that is required before participating in the experiments that we students must participate in before the thanksgiving break to receive credit for this class. i thought the test was extrememly interesting. some of the answers i were a little sketchy. in this i mean, i was unsure if the answeres i put really reflected myself or if they were merely just answers of how i want to see myself. i have a fear of aligators. that is what i meant if i had a fear of any type of animals. i have had bad dreams about aligators, but not recently. there was one that i had and then had that same dream reoccuring the months and even years following. yet, i haven't had dreams of aligators in a long time. i anticipate this class, for i have always found psychology an interesting subject. well, who wouldn't. my mother never wanted me to become a psychiatrist because she said that listening to other's people's problems all the time would make a pretty girl like me ugly. i hold my mother on such a high pedistool, that i never thought of majoring in the subject again. i am a biology major. i am still unsure if that is what i really want, or if it is something that i have been trained to want since i was a child because the field was promising. i am having problems in calculus, i really don't care for the subject in the least, but it is part of my major. i feel that if i change my major just because it has a subject that i don't care for in its curriculm, that i will quit anything, for that matter, when things start getting tuff. i feel i will be a quiter. i have never felt that way about myself before and i don't intent to ever feel that way. the class does scare me. i am terrified actually. i must keep an average of a 3. 0. this may not seem to be difficult, coming from an overall average of 3. 6 gpa at texas a&m univeristy, corpus christi. but then i was not on a financial aid plan and i knew my parents would still pay for school even if my grades fell below a 3. 0 average. so i intend to persure my dreams with my mind focused and my thoughts secured on one thing, making an a in every class. even though i know that it will be almost impossible in calculus ii, i am going to try my hardest and i want to make my parents happy. they have given my so much already. and to make myself happy, is to make my parents happy. i don't want to be the reason of my unhappiness. if i can't make myself happy, then who really can?

" today is a very stressful day, i just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when i don't understand something perfectly i get really frusterated. my boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. why can't he just let me do what i want? i'm kind of homesick lately. people know all their friends from high school and i'm just alone from wisconsin, besides shane who is not being very nice lately. well actually it's me not being very nice. it's really weird because my friends and i all have birthdays this week. mine's on september 11th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. it never really is. two years ago my party got crashed by richard and then last year it was 9-11. hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 9-11. i think it will. the fact that i have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. oh well i think i've officially decided that i'm changing my birthday to september 12th. my friends and i are all going to hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. i called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought i was going to drop out of school. they wanted to make sure that i had been studying. they don't realize that i am on my own now and that i can deal with my own problems myself. janelle and i just found this new diet. you eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. you have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because i'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. i palyed on a soccer team today. our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. it was a good workout because it was so hot out. it was alot of fun, i scored three goals and i broke darius' toe. oops! i feel kind of bad. i hate the fact that the last 2 weeks all i've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. now i realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. i also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good gpa. i set goqals for myself today because i was reading a book at barnes and noble and i said that i was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. hopefully i can do that. i think i will be able to. i can't believe that shane hasn't called yet. i either thought he'd call at 10am or not at all. oh well there's more out there. i am having a lot of fun here though, so i don't really care if we break up.

"i would guess the only thoughts in my head right now are on weather or not i doing the things i should be. is the sorority right for me? i really don't like my pledge class that much but i like most of the other girls in alpha phi. i don't know i'm just so afraid that i've totally missed god's plan for my life. it worries me. what if pharmacy isn't where i'm supposed to be. i love listening to people's problems and just being there to help them but i don't know what to do with that. where are my thoughts headed i'm not exactly sure i let my though wonder lots of times and they just kind of go in every direction. sometimes the end up to will i ever find the guy i'm supposed to marry? i really do wonder that sometimes. he has to be out there somewhere but where? i don't know. i hate watching emily and justin. its really kind of stupid but its not that its stupid its that i want that too. that guy has to be out there somewhere and i just haven't found him yet but i always want a boyfriends it just seems like lots of time i have bad luck finding one. and it seems that everyone here has one all the freaking time. its annoying i want to find that christian perfect guy out there for me. maybe it is chris but i doubt it. we're just way to different. i don't know. its crazy being here at college things are so different. i don't know exactly where i'm supposed to be. hopefully i'll find it soon. i like the things i'm doing but something's wrong. i have doubts anytime i'm not doing them if that what i'm supposed to be doing but then i'm with those people and i have a great time. it's really confusing. i just need to find that close best friends that i haven't quit found yet. and i really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. i think god is putting me there for a purpose but what it is i'm not sure. i just can't wait. i just hope by that time i'll know what it is i'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. its like i feel sometimes i'm putting on a show. it's weird. i hate that i'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. it makes it really hard to fit in. i just need to find my group but hopefully i have now with joining hyde park. it'll be all good. its weird i think that with all the moving i've done it changes things here because i'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. it's weird. i can't wait though to see some of my old friends. it'll be great fun i miss them lots but then i don't either. i just need to find my new group its what i've been waiting for for a while now and i know that group includes a boyfriend. i guess i'm more ready to find that guy than i wanted to admit. its not like i'm ready to get married just to find him and start getting to know him better. i just want to find my best friend and that best friend will be the man of my dreams who i will marry and i guess i'm just being impatient to meet him. very quickly. because it'll be so neat to find him. i can't wait for tonight because i""ll be going back to church and that's always fun its my favorite thing to do. it's a good thing. and i don't want to go home this weekend but i know i need to so i'm not to happy about that. its really weird as i am wiring this i'm seeing more into me of feelings that i've tried to hide but i guess are there more than expected. its funny i don't know what i'm looking for but i need to find it. i have god and i really want to deepen my relationship with him tremendously. i think i'm on the right path for that. i'll get there soon. i just don't know when. i'm so glad though that i found my church home that makes me feel lots better. really it does. i just know i have a home now. and my impulse group is great. i know that will be tons of fun. i just can't wait until wed when we have it again. i think that will be something i'll look forward to each week because its so much fun. and i think i will get along with my group very well. i really miss my grandma lots. she was like my best friend last semester and i could tell her anything. it was nice and i still can except she doesn't write me long email back. i wish she would it would make it better. but that's ok she's still getting the hang of the internet. some day she'll learn how to use it and become a pro. i know she will. i hope there isn't anything really wrong with her leg. that wouldn't be good. i'm sure there's not but you never know and she loves to hide it form everybody which is bad because what if there is something really wrong. it doesn't do any good to hide it from everybody. she didn't let my grandpa do it so why should we let her do it? not fair and it won't happen.

"i'm really behind in school work right now. i have been working so much that i have put school work aside. i have a lot of things to buy and not enough money for everything. i'm wondering if i really need to buy a mask for my scuba class. that means i would have to invest ninety bucks in a mask and at least twenty for the snorkel. another thing that makes me really mad is that i just bought those flip-flops today and somebody stole them. that makes me so mad, it's like nobody has any integrity anymore. i don't understand every time i find something in a store i always turn it in. that's the way i would like for my things to handled if i left them. it just makes me mad. sure, they were on a super sale for ten bucks, but still, that is not the point. i wonder where my honey is at. oh yeah he had a flight meeting to attend. i wonder when he'll be back. it's already nine. okay, let's think, what do i have to do tonight. i have to finish up my economics homework, gosh i have to get at least a b in that class. i also have to get a good grade in this psych class. i wonder who's right outside, they sure are making a lot of noise. oh yeah, i have to do good in this class because i need it for my sequence to apply to the school. so i have to finish up this homework and then do eco. i'm glad i don't have to worry about digging up all the answers since i already found a bunch of them. i have to read for social work and i need to go and buy the sports package. i need to find out what time i have to be at work on wednesday evening. i don't think my boss understands that my class doesn't let out until five and she wants me at work by five thirty, she's crazy. gee, i'm really thirsty. gosh, i have got to get back into homework. i have a test in sw on the 22. i have so much reading. i hate reading especially about research stuff. i think the only reason i'm caught up in psych is because most of the reading is pretty interesting and so is the prof. and economics, i guess i'm just afraid to fall behind in that class. so my goal for the evening will be to get all this psych stuff done and economics and get through the chapter in social work. that shouldn't be too hard. i kind of like that jason isn't home but i'm getting worried about him. if he were here then i probably wouldn't' be getting this done. on the other hand he has plenty of physics and calc to do also so i guess we'll both be getting school work taken care of tonight. i'm so excited that i'll get to go to one of the football games this year. at least i'll feel like a normal college student for a day. i wonder how that slip that i just bought fits. i have yet to try it on. i bet jason will love it but he will just have to wait. gosh, i'm hungry. what did i eat today, oh yeah i ate chinese. i really have to get in touch with bob. i feel so bad that i haven't contacted him. i need to extend my condolences to his family. i bet his poor mother must be miserable without her husband. i don't know what i would ever do if i lost jason, that's because we're not even married.

" oh boy, the first writing assignment. i hope i am doing this correctly. i can't really think of anything else right now. i sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. i am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can i say. i am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. i don't know what i feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so i guess its a little warm in here. i can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. i guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 20 min of writing sure will suck. well, i still don't know what to think. i'm still bored. i'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company i enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and i occasionally see her on the weekends, although i've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now i'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. i'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but i think i had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when i when i bought it using his credit card account. i guess i thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but i ignored his call because i am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, i like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy i know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although i'm a passivist, i hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. i thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, i think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. i wonder how they're doing. its been a while since i last talked to almost any of them, and i just wonder how they're doing. maybe i should go up there sometime. although i have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. i'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now i'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. i think his parents weren't too happy about it, because i've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but i ignored his call as well. now i'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy i've know for almost 18 or 19 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. i'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase i know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although i'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, i know he'll be happy, and for that reason, i too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, i hope that this will end soon. and now i see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and i, which i don't thin she should do. i think i'll stop her when i'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till i'm done. yippie.

"i don't know i fell kind of weird talking to a computer. well today has been a really strange day. i didn't start school until 2pm so that was great. it lets me get lots of sleep. i think if i didn't get enough sleep i would be more stressed out then what i already am. ok feeling weird again. i don't know what to type about. ok, well yesterday i realized this guy that has three classes with me. so that is kind of cool. i went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes. we later found out we had another class together, philosophy. it is such a big class, i was not surprised i never notice this guy was in my class. after that i went to read by psychology book because i'm kind of behind on my reading. today i finally caught up. i feel better in that sense, but i'm still behind in my other courses. it's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time. but i see other people and they seem to be doing less work then i am. they are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating. if none applies then i kind of feel sorry for them. this weekend i finally get to go home. i'm kind of happy to go back because i miss my baby sister. she is like one year old, so i hate to miss her growing up. she is really funny and i love her a lot. when i'm at home she follows me everywhere. as for my parents i miss them too, buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them. more stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress. "" i love my parents and all, but i like living on my one; well kind of, still have a roommate. when i go back home i get preferred treatment. this is because my parents miss me a lot. i'm actually not that home struck, i don't find it too difficult to live afar. i think this is partially because i know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away. i do feel sad that i'm not spending time with my family though. in this sense i feel inhumane, because i made the final choice of coming to austin. well it seems like half my time is over and i am starting to run out of mind speech. ok, i'm just typing to type. well, then that water bottle looks really good about now. i actually find college possible as long as i find time to study. that is the hard part because i spend most of my time walking from class to class, cleaning my room, doing laundry, taking a shower, eating, or just relaxing for a moment. there are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time. it's kind of aggravating but i guess that's just the way life is. i guess someday i'll get to rejoice in all that i have accomplished in the far future. i am scared of failure, but i deal with it. it's not the end of the world. i like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else i will use it as an excuse to not do something. i think psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific. i was like wow, i remember reading about that but don't exactly remember the detail to answer the question. that is another thing i am afraid of. not being capable to learn all the stuff i need too. i know that if i gave myself enough time, like years i could definitely remember the details. but in the allotted time i have to learn all this information, along with other classes, just thinking about it makes my head hurt. i can't picture myself learning every single thing the book has. especially when i have 5 books, and i have to learn almost all the information in all the books. yeah, well i got my head hurting again. one good side is that this typing thing is almost over and i can continue studying. although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life, this is what actually goes on in my head all the time. especially the headache part. i think one of my major weaknesses is my english. basically i learned english from tv because no one at my house spoke it. i guess my first language was spanish, until i began watching tv and understood it. i hate having weak english skills though because i always below average. i guess its the one thing i'll never be good at.

"right now my mind says why the hell do i have to do this. i'm not up to doing this crap because i just woke up and i realized that i have to get this homework done before it is due in class. i have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl i love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and i don't appreciate that. anyway i have realized that i have been slacking off in my classes and i have to get started on doing all of my homework because if i don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and i am going to be here all alone. i think that at he is stupid for what he did and i hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose, then i will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, i am also thinking about this girl named felicia that i met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that i have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. i don't think that she thinks much about me but i sure do hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy i am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so i we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out.

" ok, i'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since i've been told i type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of mark's mind. i hope that no one reads this seriously at all. ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. that was fast, i'm telling you this is a waste of time and i'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. i'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. i miss my wife. yeah that's right my wife. we aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and i do. i certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because i actually do take it very seriously. i love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. now i'll write about pizza hut. they got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than i will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. i know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and i will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. i hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children i will do whatever i can to ensure this. i love my wife so much. i miss her terribly. there seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how i have many a time disputed the reality of free will. how can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. because if i had full free will i could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that i would be judged for my actions on earth. but since i couldn't choose whether or not i could be exposed to such information. i am a catholic. this is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. but the truth is that i consider myself a part of this religion yet i do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. for example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. my idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this: good people go to heaven. bad people go to hell. simple right? except what i qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. so what now? is my idea of good right or is theirs. but wait, the plot thickens. i have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. you see i believe that god instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. the most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something i find to be unacceptable i can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. i am almost always right in this aspect. every time i have seen something i think is wrong i can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. however, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. the hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. i am not proud of all that i've done in my life. the only reason i can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because i apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. i once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. one of the worst days of my life. there is no reason i can use to explain my actions. but i did it to end the relationship. yeah, i know what you're thinking. good job huh? well she didn't want to leave anyway. at least that was what i thought. i was so damn confused. i cheated on her, a rule i set for myself a long time ago was that i would never cheat on a girlfriend. and i did. i disgraced myself and i hate. er hated myself for it. i did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. should an infraction upon the rule about never cheating on my girlfriend i must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. i don't know if i'm wrong. but i could be. man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. now i'm listening to damien rice. the little known writer of some of the best music i've ever heard. i think he's great. it's kind of weird i guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but i do. i also like this guy joseph arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. i love the way i can relate to it. i recently read ""a streetcar named desire"". the female role of blanche. she is like my ex. she lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want"" never tell me what i want. only i know that and i don't appreciate being told. if anyone ever makes assumptions about who i am before i meet them. i get reasonably angry but i hide it pretty ok. you. for some reason i have been descrimanated against for being mexican twice in my life. both times by a girlfriends family. i have an extraordinarily pale complexion. the funny thing about that is one of them is mexican. heh what can i say.

right now i am wondering how can i fit into college. i am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. now my mind is totally blank. i am wondering why i cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. i am i going to be judged by how i write this. does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. again i am stopped by the nothingness that i am thinking. its as if at one moment i am this intelligent individual and the next i am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. as i sit in my dorm writing this i am wondering whether or not i could be doing something else more fun. it is quite lonely in this room. for the most part i think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who i am. for the most part i have never been in love with a girl. what i want is exactly the opposite. i am ready for a relationship. now instead of going on about this i am reflecting on what i just said. i am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. but there are also very good things also. i think about how lucky i am to get such a great education from this university. i realize that not many people have this chance. i hope to really discover who i am in the next four years. i think that maybe the reason i have been writing all these negative things is because i am sick. i have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way i think. ok on to a different topic. i was just watching the road rules on mtv and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. i think this is the perfect case with me. in my family we never really showed any emotions. not once have i ever told my mom that i love her. maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. i feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that i have been close to. i don't really open my self up to anybody. all my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. my mom always said that i was shy. maybe she negatively reinforced why i am so shy. but enough about that. i was just thinking about an amazing experience that i had with my dad last week. i was in my parent's room playing guitar. my dad comes in and starts playing along with me. my dad and i don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. i was happier than ever before. my dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as i played along with him. it was such an amazing experience. well i think that i have run out of time. ,0,0.352564 -0.528852 1.034633 -0.965646 -1.287967 -0.391702 1.071413 0.621166 1.615649 -0.42762 -0.182767 -0.590446 -0.010931 1.769931 0.753872 0.0 -0.04277 0.362138 1.197983 -0.507167 1.127389 -0.182077 -0.746492 1.229274 0.025509 0.448933 0.062635 -0.273151 0.151925 0.486418 0.17441 -0.600946 -0.291092 1.104418 -0.676235 -0.655399 0.807293 2.012912 2.715152 -1.472237 0.335563 0.705523 1.188072 -0.677376 -0.264602 0.05939 -0.724538 -0.122094 -0.518787 -0.72274 0.782432 0.216478 0.240198 0.299329 -0.931383 -0.621556 -0.168886 -0.954251 1.501935 -0.016866 -0.887565 -0.506734 -0.480161 0.244005 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.370105 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.352153 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.166392 4.725027 4.416377 4.67707 5.15978 4.364867
"it's 11:18 at night. i'm tired, and i hate doing homework. i don't want to do homework. homework is evil. studying is evil. school is evil. all i want to do is be on the internet and surf, chat, and download. mp3s. you can never have enough mp3s. this ethernet is so fast! i love it. that's the only thing i like about college. the computer has made me antisocial. i don't need people, just need my computer. haven't really met and made many new friends. why? because i'm always in my room. because i'm always on the computer. i choose it over other things. things like studying. pikachu is lonely. he's sitting on my bed all by himself. just sits there. jester food is disgusting. i don't like it, but sometimes you have no choice but to eat it. nasty. kinsolving is better. eating in my room is good. i have better food in the closet. i mean, jester food isn't as horrible as it sounds, just that it's so fattening. just about anything on the main course menu has over 50% of the daily fat intake. that's way too much. worried about calculus. i hate math. got really bad teachers for math in high school, so now i'm paying the price. i wish i had better teachers. wish the room was colder. still got to study tonight before i can go to bed. got to study calculus. have a quiz on thursday. and a chemistry quiz too. it's so hot outside. i don't want to go out. adding on to antisocialness. it's better at night when it's cooler. i like it cooler. the internet is so fast. i think i will live on campus next year just for the ethernet access. sounds like a stupid reason. but it's reason enough for me to stay. i hate working out. it's hard work and i sweat. is the 20 minutes up yet? i don't think so, almost time. hahah. then i will be done with this evil homework assignment. i'm tired. i want to sleep. there's a stupid paperclip on my screen. i'm in word right now because my spelling sucks. and i don't care. the computer takes care of it for me. told you the computer is a great great friend. who needs real people when you have the computer? i've never eaten ants before. i don't think i want to eat insects. survivor was a good show. i tried to watch it every week. i liked summer. did nothing. i wish it was summer again. i got post it notes in the mail today. i am happy. stupid people complain to me about stupid things like hurting feet. food is good. school is evil. it's the devil! ok! yay! my time is up. good bye.

" i am feeling a little worried right now about my classes and how well i'll do on the tests and other assignments. i'm used to the class settings now but it's still a little strange to me to be in a class with 100 or more students. i wonder how i'll do in my biology and chemistry classes next semester because i've already heard how difficult it is. i'm stressed out with college work due to the daily reading assignments and i have to take notes over the material for my future exams. i wish i was a senior so i can get out of this place and not have to study ever again! i miss home and i wish i could go visit sometime soon. but of course i can't because i have tests and other things coming up. i can't wait until thanksgiving so i can go home and relax with my family and friends. i wish i knew more people here or at least have some close friends. i haven't been able to start a conversation with anyone in my class. it's probably because i'm shy and afraid to go up to a stranger and just casually start a conversation. i really do miss my high school friends and i just wish i was back in high school. it was so much easier and more fun. oh well. . everyone said college is going to be the most fun and memorable part of your life. after attending the tuesday night bible study, i felt really happy and greatful that i got to meet such nice and open-hearted people. the praise was great and i liked the prayer time too. i haven't prayed to god recently and it gave me the opportunity to communicate with him again. but i felt guilty because i don't pray to god like everyone else on a regular basis. it seems as though i only pray to god when i need help or feeling worried and sad. i should continually pray to him from now on because it's important that i establish an existing relationship with him. i'm glad tomorrow is friday! yay!! i only have 1 section tomorrow and then i'm free until monday. hopefully i'll have a fun weekend unlike last week when i just stayed in my dorm and study.

"well, topday when i was sitting in the cafeteria, i was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, ""congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. "" that was kinda strange because i don't usually curse until i came onto this campus. i have no idea why. he asked me if i did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no i don't. i don't usually curse. the only time i ever did that was if i felt pain or something. i never felt the need to curse and i know that it's a filthy habit. i also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. i can't figure it out. i have noticed that i curse a lot and i've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, i don't really want to because it's fun. i don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion i came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because i know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but i don't care. i have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. i know that it's not but i can't stop sometimes. well, i can but i choose not too. . fire drilll!!! oh well. last i left off was awhile ago. i kinda lost train of thought. i don't remember what i wrote and i don't feel like reading what i wrote. now i feel kinda tired because i walked up the 13 flights of stairs. i wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. i'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. i'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, i'll be in big trouble. a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. i hate to pass judgements and crap like that so i pretend that it's all good. i don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but i did meet them here. i don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so i don't want to say too much. lets just say that i see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. i'm not sure what i'm suppose to write about. i know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am i suppose to write about. the first time i heard about this, i thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and i at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness. i wonder if i'm out of breath. would that effect how well i think. cause i'm writing this stupid assignment, and i seem to have trouble because i'm thinking too much about breathing. i always have this huge headache. i think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. i don't know. i don't care. actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because i can just write whatever i want and know that as long as i turn it in, i'm ok. no matter what i say or how i say it, it's all good. but, when i came in the room after that firedrill, i didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. i'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. i know i have to write for 20 min. and i have another 3-4 min. to go. i don't want to do this anymore. i'm tired. i'm not even thinking anymore. i got to pee, but i don't want to unless i'm finished with this assignment. man i got to pee. ok, i'm going to end this assignment now that i think i'm done.

"right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes. but i'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet. ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things i don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. i think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad i think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. he's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. i'm going to be so behind in economics. i tell you. i really like that class though. so anyways. i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. a very few. whatever. i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. i just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" i think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"". that is really very jr. high. i miss those days. i wonder how cindy is doing. ugh. i really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again. i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. damn that sounds really conceited. maybe i'm a little of that too. i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. it's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. within reason that is. so anyway. i am these things but i feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted. i know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. i am so proud of myself lately. i am being such a good girl. although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway. i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. i'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. i have been developing such good habits. i make my bed everyday, i wash my face twice a day, i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early. o shit. i just got a little flash of procrastination. that sneaky devil. no go away!!!. i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. i just don't have the time for that. i run every day . mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. damn that dinner. ugh. what else do i do. o yea. i didn't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too. i haven't been drinking. i haven't been too flakey. with the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. anyway we are good terms at the present. i'm being a pretty good daughter. i finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. i want to write about something cool. no luck. i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes. bad flutes in lol. i'm probably really bad by now. i wonder if there is practice rooms around. i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. i thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. and then i would act all shy and innocent. it's just how i act. natural reflex to wanted attention. sometimes i think i'm so stupid. and then they would flatter me and ask me out. and i would act like i wasn't really sure. i little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so i imagine) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. this has been a pleasant venting experience i tell you.

" i just walked in my room from going out and it seems the ac is not working. the room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days. the smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as i look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor. two canvases lay on the stained carpet. the idea was to paint each one different, but to have the same motif. it was harder to come up with an idea than i thought it would be. that was a few hours ago, which was before i had a glass of the fratty punch. it's so silly, how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol. what are they trying to do to us? women are not primitive. we understand what they have in mind. see, if it was up to the guys, they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn. but it is the punch that us ladies enjoy, and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply. as i stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys' house, i suddenly asked myself a question. do these boys really want to talk to me? i wondered. and if they do. why? two things quickly were brought to my attention. one was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company, or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on, one which by the way took me 35 minutes to pick out. how ironic huh?! the other was the fact that if they didn't desire to converse with me, that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk, and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties. it was then that i realized that either way, they were talking to me, and i got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne, as well as to look into their dreamy eyes! those stupid frat boys. man are they dumb, but they sure are entertaining!!!

""the artist"" for most part are really down to earth and i look forward to every dance there is. its been two weeks since school started, yet our room still stinks!!!!!! we cannot take the smell out. being in the ninth floor. we cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of nowhere land stuck in a corner were no body comes an visit us. that's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. its sunny outside its not hot like it usually is. i love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. that little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. i love that smell of wet grass as well. ummmmmmmmmmmm. so one did popcorn and i smell it all the way over here. 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry i got distracted by the timer less then am done. it been distracting since it started ",0,-0.578704 -0.271619 -1.138156 0.369945 -0.270646 0.410389 -0.040154 -0.184085 -0.640483 -0.086821 -0.215069 -0.590446 1.129669 -1.208105 -0.129542 0.0 -0.04277 -0.297881 -1.015325 1.191445 -0.7504 -0.742368 -0.536374 2.125567 -0.624052 0.049737 -0.151886 1.127599 -0.227664 0.50187 1.82745 -1.073465 -0.861264 -0.473116 -0.429288 -0.327368 -2.012082 0.132552 -1.73761 -1.35728 -1.038726 -1.885274 0.227538 -0.401915 -0.760611 0.113203 -0.775702 -0.345333 -0.027706 -0.463699 -0.822954 -1.572231 1.41101 -0.853352 -1.479662 0.509281 -1.001272 0.368959 1.188077 -0.104775 0.552759 -0.030512 -0.480161 2.662912 -0.546834 1.072835 -0.086094 0.743447 -0.613718 -0.073676 1.497076 -0.607823 1.382891 -0.337085 2.118201 -1.396907 2.394059 0.151675 0.13658 4.408096 4.223626 4.33755 4.574206 5.315448
"o. k, so now i'm writing for this assignment. i'm going to turn off the music i'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, i like new order. i like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. i'm probably more into that than most people i know. i wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night i ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. i totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and i crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and i hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was ""bamn"" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that i still live at home, i still live at home. i'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but i'd like to have my own place. but i don't have the money for that because i pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but i do feel good when i say that to other people, usually at work is when i do that. i work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. i got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that i could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. i keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a ""how are you"" exchange. things are going better with my parents and i. there was a time before ut,(i'm a transfer from acc)where i didn't really care much about things. probably because i wasn't being challenged, except from work which i enjoyed'enjoy. anyway, i was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob marley type stuff. i have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although i wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. i stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. i wish i was done now. funny because i was looking forward to doing this, but i thought it would be more of a stop'start thought process. it seems like i'm just narrating my last couple of days. i was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and i am somewhat. wish i had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, i have to write for an entire twenty minutes. i wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this. my face is all rough and ""treated"". i have avg acne, not really the worst i've had. i am using treatment though which helps. my mom just went into the laundry room which i assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean. because i told her that i would clean it last night because i went on a bike ride instead. in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time. but for some reason i like wasting time. there she goes back into the laundry room. and no comment, but no inspection either. i have a good view from the office room where i am typing this twenty minute thing. itching my eye felt good. my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position. now that i noticed that, i noticed i'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to gregory gym and how i can't really yet because i am a gimp. not really though, i could easily tough it out, i'm competitive and athletic, or use to be. sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years. i knew i'd miss high school for that reason. i like when i repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when i typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance. i was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than i had expected in the end. ok, that was interesting, something i don't really want to do again, or do i? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing. ok, finished.

"i tried three times to get this web site and it kept bringing up that the server was down. i am the mother of a 10 month old and when he goes to bed, that is the time i need to get busy and do my work. i often stay up until 2 or 3 am trying to get everything done that i need to get done. i have the king and i on the tv, i am looking very much forward to going to the bass concert' performing arts center to see it. i bought three tickets. my husband and i are going and taking my grandmother for her 75th birthday. it should be a real treat. the house is quiet except the tv (on low) and the dishwasher. i love the sound of the dishwasher. it is a night time sound for me because when i was growing up my mother would turn it on after the news on her way to bed. it is a comforting sound. it was a normal bedtime noise then, now 20 years ago, and now in my own home i enjoy the sound. i would miss it if we were to get one of those new expensive machines that didn't have the same rolling and tumbling sounds. i love water, the ocean, it kind of reminds me of that, but in thinking about it also probably sounds like being in utero. this musical is so beautiful, i just love the musicals of the past, a time long gone except you can visit through videos, theatre in your mind. its sort of and escape from daily hectic real life schedules. speaking of hectic every day schedules, my car is in the shop. it was there today since 9am and at 445pm i hadn't received a call about it yet. i don't think they are very considerate, i had to call, and if i hadn't would they have closed up and gone home without saying a ***** word to me! probably. in order for me to be in class at noon tomorrow, i need to have nicholas at the daycare by 11am . and i have to have a way to get the car. freddie works night at the post office and he needs to go to bed when he gets home, not fool around waiting to take me down to the honda service dept. being without your car is a big pain in the butt. it is the air-conditioning , door locks, and electric window. of course, it is the drivers window that is messed up, and when you unlock the door with the key, it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't lock and unlock the real drivers door. and usually it is when i have my arms full of stuff, the baby, and when i am in a hurry. as soon as i am finished, here in a matter of minutes, i can go read the mountain of books i had to get this semester. man, this assignment is making me sweat. when i complain about things i often feel bad, because i know there are people who have it worse than i do. we watched titanic . broken up in three evenings, it was good, but it made me cry. what a way to die. or lose your family or loved ones. life is the sweet with the tart. i guess. i am curious what will be achieved from your collection of these stream of consciousness writings. i have more than satisfied the 20 minute requirement now, i would like to print this as a receipt, but guess what? my ink cartridge is out, and it was for the survey too, so i hope i can pull it up again and print it when i get out to buy one, i tried at target last week, but of course, they were out !!! the story of my life.

"right now i am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. i really wish that i had worked on this assignment earlier. i am now starting to worry because i have to finish calculus homework and read a few pages for engineering. and i have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. it is bugging me that i left that one problem unfinished. it is also bugging me that i left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. i never thought about that before, but i do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. weird. i just had an epiphany. it is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. like a word you've never heard before. take before. before before before before before before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. that is really odd. and it works with every word, too. hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. not thinking of much anymore. i used to think of how much i missed home. now it is not so prominent. i don't think of roshi as much. i still do sometimes. but it comes and goes. i am not going to let myself get trapped like i have before. it is just a vicious cycle. i feel much better this time. i have somehow learned to overcome sadness. i dunno exactly how it happened, but i have learned to overcome and bypass it. it doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. now that i think about it, i am really starting to wonder how i managed to do that. inherently, i think that i can get fixated easily; that right there is a sign that i am bound to get hurt one of these days. and i have. but i have learned. the question is, how? hmm. oh well. no matter now. as long as i can do it. that is good enough for me. maybe its the college atmosphere. being alone and on my own. in a sense, anyway. i look around my room and realize that i do not miss home. i don't know why. i missa family and friends at time, but i don't miss them. its weird. maybe its because i don't consider myself away from them. mysha said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on labor day. maybe i need to stay away from home longer. hmm. that must be it. mysha got me thinking about roshi again. hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. it can't be too hard; lots of people have already met people. i jsut need to go and try. steve knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. comes natural to him though. i honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. i feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. i am liking the way i am handling things, liking the way i have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that i can make my own decisions. i am starting to feel better and better about college life. it is great. except for all the people. there is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. a sort of fakeness. many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. people don't act the way i am used to seeing them act in high school. maybe that is it. asians don't act like asians at home, for one thing. most other people act the same, but the asians here don't. a little different. a little meaner? that can't be it though, i really need to meet more and judge. ugh. i feel like i've just cursed myself for saying that. i really didn't mean that. i am being too cynical i guess. but you can't win them all. i am happy otherwise; i have met a few good friends, i like the campus, and i am close to home. i feel connected in all aspects. ut was probably one of the best choices i ever made. my dad thinks so. he told me the other night. i always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. he usually is, i've learned. almost always. i need to learn to respect that. i'm the one who's usually wrong. oh well. better late than never. time for calculus.

" i'm feeling that i miss my girlfriend in san antonio. as we do this i feel that she is my everthing i can't get her out of my head. what else i can't get out of my head is this music that the dorm next door to me is playing, it is making me really frustrated because i can't think quite as well. i hope that jess is okay, i worry about her a lot. she doesn't sleep too well, and that kind of worries me but she is extremely strong so i'm not too worried about it. i am kind of worried about what she just wrote to me in a letter i got. i know that she loves me but this college stuff, being apart and all is quite difficult. i don't like it and neither does she, and she wrote something that worries me, that she kind of wishes that we never met so that we never fell in love and therefore never have to endure the hardship of parting. i miss her a lot. my days primarily consist of me waiting around for her to get to her computer so i can instant message her, and communicate with her, truly the highlight of my day. the rest of my day is that of school, college that is, and i feel somewhat like a hermit but not too much, because i have her. she really is my everything, and i know that we will be together, forever. one thing that i do feel uneasy about is the fact that she is a christian and that i am an atheist. this hasn't played a part in our relationship, but i'm afraid that one day it will. i am a pacifist atheist and therefore will usually ignore most people's idea's, i know that that is wrong but oh well it's the way that i feel. i really don't want to destroy her sense of spirituality either, i've done it before to other people and it really makes them feel bad, and lost. i don't ever want to hurt jess, i love her, in fact i feel that i have to protect her from everything. i miss her, i don't like the fact that i have to be here in austin and she is nearly by herself in san antonio. but there is a glimer of hope, we might get an apartment together next year. i really hope that we do, that would be so great. i can think of nothing better than waking up to her smiling face everyday, and thinking to myself that i am the luckiest guy in the world. i hope that that happens, it really does help to have something that you can think about while you are away from someone that you love. all i can think about is how great it is when i make my bi-monthly trips during the weekends to see her. in fact i'm trying to plan something this weekend for her to make her feel as special as she really is. i think the world of jess. i don't know what i'm going to plan yet, i just can't think with this music, it really does irritate me quite a bit, i'm thinking that after the twenty minutes are up that i will go over there and tell them to turn it down. i love jess. i wish that i was with her right now, in fact sometimes i wish that i didn't have to go to college, just stay with her were we used to work forever. just being together with nothing to stop us, no one to get in the way, and no time constraints placed upon us. i love her very much. wow, i just looked at the clock and i have used 17 minutes already, only three to go. man, my fingers are getting tired from typing so much. i can usually get about 30 words a minute out, but i'm out thinking my typing, i want to write something down, and then bam another thought is in my head, my fingers can't keep up. i sure hope that i finish soon, because i see that my jess is online and that i want to talk to her real soon, this is the stuff that i wait hours for, just a chance to talk to her to be with her always. she is my everything, and i care for her deeply. i do get to see her on friday and i'm really happy. i hope that she will have as much fun as i will. i can't stop thinking about jess.

" i'm cold right now. i should get a blanket. i miss my boyfriend. i wonder if he's at work right now. it's 11:28 there. someone's being loud in the hall. maybe it's those weird girls that melissa and i had to look at last night. they wouldn't stop chittering! and it was almost 3 o'clock in the morning! i had to wake up this morning at 7, but i didn't get up until 7:33. i hate waking up early. my eyes are all sleepy, and i couldn't keep them open in spanish! i love my spanish class. prof. montiel is quite interesting. oooh! the 2nd season of friends is coming out soon. i should get that. but i like prof. montiel. i like his accent. this morning he told us that we (8:00 class) are going to adopt a poor hispanic family in december for christmas. what a good idea. i need to go and find a service organization to join. i think a sorority would be fun, too, but i don't feel like paying for my friends. my friend heather took out a loan for her sorority at a&m. silly girl. but it's typical of her. yesterday was my birthday. i don't like being at school for birthdays, i've decided. you don't get as much attention here as at home. i felt kind of lost, in fact. my roomie brought me flowers, though. and mom sent 50 million presents. but it's not the same as being there. i don't want to go home, though. i like being away from home. i just miss my cat, though. i like having something warm and furry to come interrupt my homework. he's so cute! i also miss my dad. poor dad. mom's going to drive him crazy. dad told me that he's going to start kayaking more often. mom needs to get out more. all she does is sit at home, read, and worry about me. definitely a disadvantage to be an only child. but i did have a pretty good child hood. i had enough friends. too many, sometimes. i really like that lucien character on amelie. he reminds me of joey. only, joey's not mentally ill. i would hate to have to wake up as early as joey does every day. four-thirty in the morning is insane! silly marines. what do they possibly get done that early in the morning? don't they realize that the majority of their troops are ages 18-25? i've heard that people in that age group, and then teenagers as well, are prone to stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning. makes sense to me. i would do it every day if i could. i like staying up late (when i have the energy). for some reason i feel like i can get more done at night. like cleaning'organizing my room, for example. why would i want to do that at night when i'm just as capable of doing it in the morning? that doesn't make any sense. i need to change the song on the stereo. i'm not in a very ub40 place. righteous brothers are good. but this song reminds me of joey again. i hope that the marine corp. birthday ball goes well in november. i'm really nervous. what should i wear? good grief, i never thought that i'd type that kind of question. how flaky. but i am still wondering what to wear. would a gown work? and what color? this isn't like a school dance or anything. this is a real thing, where marines and their wives'girlfriends are there. older people, i mean. i always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. i feel like they're all wondering, what is she doing with him? or she's way too young to be here. my hands are beginnning to ache. i keep backspacing my mistakes. perfectionist. that's me. i wonder if i really am one. maybe not. i wonder where melissa is. i should look at her schedule. if i can find it, i mean. my feet are cold. how do i keep that from happening? and why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's? is it some sort of evolutionary thing? or just another one of those differences? i miss my friends. maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. but i miss brandon and lauren. and mary. i couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. my mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. whatever. she could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. i don't get it. sometimes i feel like she's the best friend ever. but then other times (*most times) i feel like i'm being left behind again. why do i get left out? i think i'd like me if i were someone else. even when i'm with brandon, or lauren, when we're in a group, i'm not the popular one. i really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.

"as i sit here at my desk typing, all i can think about is how hot i am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. i am under a lot of stress right now because i have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since i have trouble focusing on them. by body is starting to sweat, maybe i should tell my ra to turn down the ac. i am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much i read it, i just can't comprehend what the book is saying. i'm sure i will struggle in biology this year. at first, i couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that i am doing this i understand the purpose behind it. this is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. my stomach feels extremely full because i just came from the dobie cafeteria. i really wish i hadn't eaten so much junk food, i need to eat healthier. i am really regretting eating that ice cream, i have got to stop doing that. i also need to work out more. it all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason i am so hot is because i am sunburned. when you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? it is obviously clear that i am unfamiliar with the way my body works. i am dreading class tomorrow because i am so behind on my reading. i probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. i only have to write for a few more minutes. i wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. if i take great notes and read, even if i don't comprehend it very well, will i still be able to do well on the tests? my elbow has just started throbbing because i scraped it water skiing earlier today. i really wish i wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time i extend my elbow. oh great! time's up. talk to you later. katie ",0,-0.474035 0.951698 -0.035532 0.38495 0.33194 -0.567886 0.191586 0.098151 0.46357 -1.048631 -0.143856 0.513108 1.13981 -0.204799 0.686897 0.0 -0.04277 1.002798 0.855327 0.020641 0.907995 2.429304 -1.126642 -1.40594 -0.624052 -1.006675 -0.425487 -0.793909 -1.539774 -1.933602 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.388757 1.227844 -0.534354 -1.109326 1.862173 4.545292 0.803281 -0.378831 0.906153 0.002888 0.027635 1.843989 2.417202 -0.182336 -0.04922 -0.937434 -0.347156 -0.234338 -1.34699 -0.157239 -1.41708 1.15997 0.476346 -0.671603 0.181686 1.219833 -1.425147 -1.712265 -0.822957 0.463024 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.436251 -0.007517 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.335929 -0.051693 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.304714 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.526367 4.993671 3.824196 4.998939 5.040831 4.60101
"okay today is friday at 2:25 and at the moment i am wondering what i will be doing this weekend. i am going home on saturday with my best friend. my best friend is catherine, but now she prefers to be called cat. i have known her since i moved to kingwood (north of h-town) 5 years ago. she was my first friend and we have been through a lot together. we've also had our years of separation too. she lives a street away from me. i am listening to the cure. but the tape sucks because i used to listen to it in my car and my car's stereo sucked. now i don't even have that car. we sold it the weekend before i moved to austin. which brings me to the topic of austin. austin always seemed like such a cool place before i moved here. now that i actually live here, i wish i was back in houston. in houston i knew so many people and there was almost always something to do. and most of my friends stayed there. it's really fucking hard to meet people here since there are so many people. ironic. i have not given up yet. i guess i just have to go out more. hey psychology is my fav class. i hate math and chem is just like math to me. i used to like english in high school but now it's goofy stuff like ""everything's an argument"". i bought some ginseng today and i donot think it works. i am still tired. i am looking around my room for things to talk about because thoughts do not pop into my head unless i am looking around. i just remembered i have been having really fucked up dreams. last nite i had my 2nd weird dream. in the first one i almost died and everyone acted really strange. my second dream a lamb was killed in front of me. and there was some blue gel that was everywhere. i can't really explain it and it would take too long and i have only 8 minutes left. since i am a slacker and only do the minimum 20. i drank sobe lizard blizzard today and it was good. i think it was pina colada. right before i did this assignment, someone called and i could not understand them because the were those people who mumble. anyways i thought they were doing a survey so i went ahead and cooperated. well it turns out i was filling a visa credit card application over the phone and she told me i would get my card in a couple of weeks. i thought it was funny because i do not want a credit card and was going to tell her at the end but i decided not to. maybe she will get a bonus for getting a customer. i hope i am doing this assignment right. i did something like this in my high school english class. she had us smell crayons and write the first thoughts that came into our head. and thats what i did except everyone else seemed to have the same thoughts (thoughts about elementary, art school, projects). the crayons did not spark up any thoughts about my childhood. so i hope this writing assignment isn't supposed to spark some certain thoughts. supasticious.

" so today has completed a very odd and trying week. i have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and wow!!! i seem to find myself asking, have i over done myself? i am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this i got two kittens that require a lot of attention. this, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work i have to make sure i am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but i love them. my roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like i am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? i am not trying to say i don't take their words into consideration but i believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he'she learns. this is a test for me that i hope i don't fail at but all i keep telling myself is that i must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). i am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. she found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. the doctor said she should be alright but i still worry. i really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. all i can conclude is that i have been set a full plate that i now must eat. besides all the drama i just mentioned i have finnaly declared my major as child development' pre-med with a minor in psychology. this is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which i am very thankful for. i know it will be a lot of work but i love working with children, but now whether i follow all the way through with pre- med is a different story but i know eventually i will get through it and go to med-school. for right now i need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. another thing i am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that i could have gotten two tickets the the ou game and i passed up the opportunity. there goes a couple hundred dollars i coould have gotten off ebay. oh well, that's the way life goes. by the way, my boyfriend of three years, zack, took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. we had 12 courses in 5 1'2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). the cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). anyhoot i enjoyed writting and i will see you next time, bye.

"i guess it is about time i start my work for psychology. although, i am quite bothered that my keybourd is vibrating from all of the bass coming from the neighbor's stereo. i don't know if you know this but you can hear here people talking loudly in the hallways at all hours of the night. all in all college is better than i thought in terms of classes and proffesor, except for calculus. but it is different in terms of people. i just don't fit in with large groups of people well. i'm one to do things in small groups or one on one. i am i guess you could say shy, not so much shy as quiet. i can talk to people i just don't talk a lot. even my girlfriend whom i've known for a year now. she talks all of the time so it works out. i miss her a lot, more than my family. at my age i was ready to move out from home, but i still haven't adapted to living here yet. i need to start getting more sleep, ithink i average 5-6 hours of sleep a night. usually i'm fine except for when i am in classes, just chemistry and calculus. i want to call to talk to my girlfriend i wqent home to houston and saw her last weekend i have not spoken to her since monday, and i really want to. i have clculus i need to be working on on top of this but it isnot do until wednesday so this assignmnet is more pressing. sometimes i woory about whether or not i am going to be able to hackk it in some of my classes once we have some tests, chemistry and calculus are pretty hard. i probably chose about the hardest major thjough, electrical engineering. i keep on think ing of songs in my head but that can't well be written caan it. i enjoy music, both listening and making music. playing guitar is one of the major strees relievers for me i do it at least 30 minutes a day now that i am in college i used to only play that much a week. i've been writing more songs now too. i hadn't written any for a while so i hasd a clear fresh mind to work off of. i have been devoting most of my free time to that i guess. i can smell the perfume on a stuffed animal in the room that my girlfriend gave me, she spraid her perfume on it last time i saw her. few people are really love at this age, i think. i know i am i'm eighteen years old and i've already met someone who's d i'd love to spend the rest of my life with. she is the first girlfriend i ever had. i'm quite picky when it comes to those sorts of things. i'm suppossed to be meeting new people and building new friendships here at college, supposedly the best times of our lives, i hope that that is wrong. i'm just not socially fit for the college way. everyone on each floor knows everyone around me, but i don't. and i don't want to i just know that i wouldn't like most of these people, i am also picky about friendships. i don't like just hanging out with people for lack of a better thing to do. i just want to have a feew really good friend, instead of knowing everybodies name and that being it.

"so i'm laughing right now because i think this is really weird. makes me feel kind of uncomfortable i guess, i don't know why though. but my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and i just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. i'm kind of stressed right now, and i hope i get everything i need to get done done tonight. i'm really tired and i just want to go to bed. i'm really hot in my dorm, maybe i should turn the fan on, but i'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. so i'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. i talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. i wonder what homework he has? man, i'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. i have so much stuff to do, at least that's what i feel like. and i really want to go to tops to look at the pictures. hopefully claire will go with me tomorrow and do that. my foot is really itching me, i think i got bit by a bug tonight at the zeta house. i was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. oh i need to call my parents too. i wonder if they're having a good time in canada. i wish i was there right now. i miss them already, but i'm only three hours away so it's okay. i'll be fine. i really want to go running outside on the track tonight. it felt so good out earlier and i bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. but i probably won't because i'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. i wonder what's wrong with it. twenty minutes is a long time, i've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. i hope i have fun this weekend. i'm excited about the ut football game. the last game was so much fun even though it was raining. i guess that made it more interesting. i'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and i really miss my friends from my hometown. i really miss angie, i hope she is doing fine at kingwood college. and justin, i hope he is still not mad at me. maybe i should call him tomorrow, i think i will. and i can't believe kristin got her nose pierced up in colorado. she is a wild one, but i guess that makes her who she is. i wish i was in colorado. i love the mountains and the nice weather there. i bet she is having a great time at school. i'm spacing out right now. i never thought i could have writer's block when i'm writing about what's going through my head. that's really weird. and i'm saying really"" a lot. i guess i like that word or something, who knows. i need to go to the bathroom, but i only have about seven more minutes, so i'm just going to wait it out. is going to even a word? i'm not sure. i'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my ta for calculus teaches well tomorrow. i can't really understand him and i really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. i wish it would stop. claire just got a phone call, i wonder who it is? she is a cool girl, i'm glad i'm rooming with her. if i had to room with a complete weirdo i would freak out. that would be horrible. i think she is talking to her somewhat ""boyfriend. "" they're dating i guess, and i set them up! i did a good job. i guess he is coming up to our room right now. claire's excited! i wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. he lives in riverside so i understand. i hope justin doesn't think i'm a complete slob when he comes up here since i'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. oh well, i don't need to impress him anyways. it just got really quiet in our room. it's an awkward silence because claire just turned her fan off. she must be cold, but why and i so hot. i just popped my back and it felt so good. it's been pretty sore lately, but i'm not sure why. i just remembered that i have to read after this. that really sucks. it's going to be a long night i guess, but i can handle it. oh justin is here now, that's cool.

"i'm thinking about if i am going to get the job that i want at the pac at the university it would suck if i didn't i am proud that the otc called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like i didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so i can't type as fast and i keep having to go back and erase but i like pressure i thrive under it but i don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words i do not like those because i am so used to using slang that i just do not type it anymore and i also hate having to capitalize my i's it makes me mad having to go back. right now i feel a little stress because i am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday i had a meeting and i did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all i could read was biology which is another class i don't understand i never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either i feel lost in that class it is so difficult i feel like i dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not i just keep thinking about what prof. pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. like screaming i guess but the professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home i had a divided keyboard the ""flowy"" ones and now i have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment i like but i feel like i shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid i's and i forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the i messed me up again. well forget it no more caps; the i's are going to be in lower case. sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit i need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend i get to go home though i want to go to the game i have not boguht the sports package and i didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot i guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so i feel like i should go for him but i'm not going. now i get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe i'll get sick when i go home like prof. pennebaker said probably because i feel the migrane coming. i hate migranes i hate having to find a job hopefully i get a good one i have an interview on tuesday i hope it goes well and that i make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. i wonder how the bus works i keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause i have seen it once after running to the engineering building because i was late i saw the bus and i think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but i will take a look around and see if that's how it works. now i feel like i have run out of things to say i still have to do the experiment for this class i want to do the survey but since i am under 18 i have to get my moms signature and i feel like i should be happy about going home i mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like ""huh"" and i hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is ""kidnapped' i know i worry too much but i don't want anything to happen even if it means that i have to do all the homework, i've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was i talking about i don't kno, i need to make friends me and my roommate get along but i need other friends and now i have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends i saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart asian in the elevator today i feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that i have are okay but i don't really relate to them why i don't kno i feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least i hope they don't and if they do i don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still i have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really i am surprised i wrote this much i thought i was going to run out of this to say but i like this assignment when prof. pennebaker said it i was like yes no grammar rules i don't particularly like grammar but i try i mean i suck at it in my papers i always score low on it 2 minutes and i have mentioned my time too many times i tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and i did nto so now i keep talking about not because i want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts i think it is the flourescent lighting i think that is how u spell that and i just put the letter u for the word you and i am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and i keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh i thought it was over but i am going to stop now because a i don't want to talk for too long and i have to go turn of this light and i am thinking about what i just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if i should put my name at the bottom but i won't because i have the code thing. well this was productive and i did not put well in caps.

"this song is really sweet my computer is slow but it's cool it's doing pretty well for me i should start typing next to each other just in case i run out of room. well that's better. hehe. i don't believe monica did that. actually i'm not sure if i can write that type of stuff on here. it's kind of personal and what if someone reads this. i don't mind if pennebaker or matt reads it. but what if it's someone else. never mind about that. start thinking and type what your thinking wenshi. great now i'm talking to myself. that's funny. well. the songs over. what's next. prem is a really sweet guy and i am very lucky to have him. i'm also very lucky to have friends like amy, phong, thang,julie, janet, sean, and so many more. and especially lucky to have such a mom and dad and three brothers that really care. they take care of me. they do lots for me. wenjen upgraded this computer that i'm using to type. isn't he so nice. what a brother. it's really cold in our room. i feel like i'm talking to someone. and tell them everything about myself. but i don't think that is what stream of consciousness is. i don't know. well i'll just keep typing until time is up. oh yeah. i need to call janice and ask her if she has an extra cable for our tv in the room. good thing i wrote sentences right next to each other. this assignment would of been really long if i didn't. i know i don't have to worry about spelling and grammar and all but it kind of bothers me. it's not much the grammar and punctuation but spelling and spacing of words. i guess i'm just anal or something. who knows. i think other people like my friends and family know me better than i know myself. geez that shouldn't like that but i think that's how it is. oh well. hmm. what else should i think about. that's weird i'm thinking about what i'm thinking. hehe confusing. i miss my friends from high school that aren't going to ut. i miss my family too. my hometown isn't that far away compared to others but i still miss my friends and family. wow i don't know how others from out of state or even the country do it. it must be hard for them. i'm worried about mommy she's home all by herself. everyone is at a different place. wow. but in october all of us should be together. i can't wait until that day comes. it's going to be so cool. it hasn't been like that for more than a year. my goodness only 13 minutes have passed. i have written a lot in 13 minutes. geez. and 7 more at least. wow. i wish all papers in all my classes would be this easy. i mean it's not easy but easier than other writing assignments. you don't have to worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and just about everything else. just need something on paper. what kind of paper is that. i think i'm in paper heaven. hehe. that's like the coolest thing. i wish other teachers would be so generous. what happened to my music. i didn't pick this to be in my file or play list editor to play music continuously. but it's still a good song. i didn't even know it was in the file. that's pretty cool. actually kind of weird. hmm. i wonder how long it's been now. my hands are kind of getting tired and hard and tense from typing all this continuously. it's actually tough to type so much because you are thinking of so much at a time. it would be easier if i could type faster or my thinking would be less. hehe. that's never going to happen. i have been told i think a lot. and my mommy says i have lots of wrinkles under my feet. she says that means you keep everything to yourself. it's true for me. i don't know about others though. i think that's a cool but weird saying or superstition whatever you want to call it. it is funny too. well. what time is it now. let me look real quick. i started when the time said 1:10 and now when i looked it's 1:29. just one minute away from the minimum time. i'll type a little longer so it's not like i stopped right at 20. well the music stopped. you know what i just realized. i did pick all those songs i thought i didn't pick. that's funny. oh well. well. the playlist is out of songs i have to start it again when i'm done typing which should be ok to be now but let me check just in case the minute isn't over. i don't want to cheat and make it 19. 5 minutes. let me see here. it's 1:32. so i've been typing for 22 straight minutes. wow. my right arm is sore. it really hurts. i guess i should stop now. well nice typing for my first writing assignment in psychology. i'll be writing another one soon for the second writing assignment. well see this page later. hehe.

this is a really really cool assignment!! i think it'd be cool if i could jut talk to someone like this totally going off on tangents whenever i want to. speaking of tangents. i hate precalculus!!! i don't think i should take calculus in college cause my roommate( who i will get to later) says its really hard and he's quite the wiz at math. i'll take it at community college maybe,. yeah yeah yeah. ogh my roommate kareem. he's a friend of mine from houston. its like we've been together 24-7 since we moved in together and its really kinda annoying. i feel bad cause he was like one of my best friends and now its like i don't wanna be around him anymore!!. so i'll tell you what i want what i really really want. if you want my future forget my past. if you wanna get with me. better make it fast. spice girls suck!!! i'm listening to a new cd right now that i got at the radio station at ut---91. 7 kvrx. i'm applying for a position there as a dj or something. that should be thrilling. i just wanna be heard guys!!! if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends. if the song was called gotta get it would be cooler!!! this is gonna be like so long!!! i still have 11 minutes!! what am i gonna do!!! there was this girl in front of us in psych. today who my friend says is really stuck up and superficial so i kept whispering ""superficial"" to see if she'd turn around. she never did. so does this mean she's not superficial or she is. she just doesn't know it. as often is the case. i think this paper rocks man!! i bet ya'll get some really freaky ones like the end of the world is coming to austin!!!! the mtv video music awards is on in 2 hours1! what if i get like caught in the net and i cant watch the awards!?!?! that would suck!!! i'm going home in 2 weeks~~~ my friend is having a bisexual encounter tonite ~~that's pretty weird huh??

"simply amazed that someone has seen to it that i make it this far without more than what i have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes i could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that i'm in it for the everything i can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that i'm already there. i suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is ""special"" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. i'm glad payed attention that day. uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. i cannot pity them, i have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. i have my own to look after. i'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or i shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul.

"i'm sitting here typing on the computer and the clock is a little bit distracting, but i think i can handle it. i just connected my printer to the computer with a cable i didn't know i had. there are sirens going off outside i hope this is a safe area to live and hey my dad just walked in the door i wonder if i'm a fast enough typist i really like the picture i have in my room its of some toucans and its got a lot of color in it because i like color my couch in the living room is red and my dog won't stop barking outside. i think i'm going to go get her after i finish this assignment. i just took the long quiz so i'm tired of staring at this computer screen i still have to go find what to wear tomorrow and get a parking permit my phone is ringing hmmm should i answer it or keep typing i guess i'm going to keep typing because it stopped i hope it wasn't very important or someone doesn't think i am intentionally ignoring them my dad should be coming back soon i think he is across the street talking to the neighbors who seem to be very nice i need him to help me hang up some mirrors and finish my fence sometime this week so he can leave that doesn't sound very nice i just noticed the air conditioning is making a really weird sound my dad just walked in with my puppy her name is trinket if he claims not to like dogs i really can't tell by the way he babies her its kind of funny oh you know what happened to me today was i solved a mystery and it was kind of funny the way it happened i was online and i tried iming my best friend and she wouldn't answer back so i was thinking ok maybe she is mad at me so i called her and she said she wasn't online so i thought ok who is trying to steal her identity she wanted me to try and find out who it was so i started asking the person numerous questions awww my little puppy just came and is trying to type on the keyboard i think she just wants attention ok its really hard to type right now she keeps trying to lick my hand ok my dad is calling her to go outside and she won't listen i think she has selective hearing the air conditioner just came on again with that weird noise ouch that really hurt trinket just scratched my arm with her sharp nails i need to take her to petsmart to get her a new collar oh as i was saying about the mystery person online who was posing as my best friend, yeah i kept bugging them until they finally answered back saying please don't try to contact this address again (i think they were getting fed up with all the questions) but i kept asking who is this and it turned out to be her grandma in arkansas! it was so funny cause i was like don't you have your own sn and then it was like oh hey i know you! and she started talking to me about how i was liking ut and all and people keep signing on my buddy list and i really hope this clock stops soon because my phone is ringing again but i don't think i should stop to answer it i guess i'll call back later its only 8:56 so its not too late i just really don't want to get up in the morning oh i just got this really bad cramp in my side and its hurting really bad i wonder if appendicitis is on your left or right side cause if its on the right oh its stopped maybe it was the way i was laying on the floor its kind of uncomfortable but until i can get my desk and everything set up for my computer i guess i have to keep typing down here on the floor i'm kind of tired right now i still need to go check on my parking pass. i hope these aren't supposed to be written in complete sentences but i don't think they are because its a stream of consciousness paper and it seems like i keep worrying about too much so i'm not going to worry about it anyways the time is almost up i wonder what matt is doing right now i was talking to him last night and all the sudden the phone just cut off because i think it was his phone that ran out of batteries so it just died right there in the middle of the conversation which i really hate that i had to finish my thought this thing is addicting ",1,-1.373109 0.431096 -0.129174 0.371119 -0.096818 0.169328 -0.341476 -0.271478 -0.77429 0.689442 1.288185 -0.590446 -1.116423 -0.07043 -0.528691 0.0 -0.04277 1.19075 0.328322 -0.795527 0.132177 0.174502 1.046078 -1.237568 1.501853 -0.050599 -0.175129 -0.809315 -0.47281 -0.146901 -0.822119 0.742128 -0.51089 0.08095 -0.346915 -0.515075 0.428 -0.37654 0.790731 -0.340829 1.659965 0.691758 -0.903467 0.031281 -1.429535 2.022736 -0.610483 0.99527 1.922974 0.60339 -0.550505 -0.219973 1.783171 -0.262778 -0.861438 0.888875 0.862005 0.554115 0.365118 -1.455335 0.298819 0.546976 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 0.747996 -0.086094 -2.182441 -1.250454 0.041644 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.075703 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.055317 0.269298 -0.195815 -2.090556 4.670806 3.787348 4.772774 4.680265 4.559753
"what do i write about? that is a good question, but i guess i should write about writing, or think about thinking. the thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued i am at the moment. i have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and i just want to sit and do nothing. i guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts. part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music. jimmy buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room. i wish i were sleeping and i wish i did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because i just want to do nothing right now. i don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued. i did not have much class today, so i got to sleep in, but i could still use some rest. perhaps i need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future. i just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class. i have been in school here for about two weeks, and i think it is really quite a cool set up. you don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence. sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in psychology, only my other classes. the biggest adjustment i think from high school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade. one of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball. that guy is such a mess and i was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer. let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun. it is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human. i am trying to search for thoughts, but i just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts. all of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville. "" i wish i were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad. we have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around austin. but now my hands are kind of aching because i don't think i have ever typed this long without taking a break. i am certain that i wil have great stamina in my hands when i am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly. it is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music. i like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy. i look up at the clock and see i am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes. i feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which i have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. this writing is not so painful as i though because i was sure that i would just go braindead and have nothing to say. i do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing. looks like i am out of time.

"ever since i came to austin about three weeks ago, the way i think has been sort of different than it used to be when i lived in houston. i feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. now that i am no longer in high school i feel that i can be my own person and that no one is judging me. the only time i feel like i have to put on a fake persona is when i am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. a lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people i knew in high school. maybe i just care too much about what other people think about me. hopefully being in the ut environment will change the way i feel. in fact, as i mentioned earlier, i feel that my mind is freer. that makes me really happy. my roommate just walked into the room, and i am really glad she is my roommate. she is probably not someone i would have hung out with in high school, but since i've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what i maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. for example, she is a liberal and i am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. i've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. it feels so strange to not see them everyday like i was used to. i think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. overall, i love college life so far because i am discovering myself and learning about different values that i am glad i am becoming familiar with. i am really glad that i am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. it gives me a sense of reward when i accomplish something i have been working hard on. my favorite subject to study is calculus because it makes me feel content when i complete a homework assignment and i understood what i did. especially when i learn and apply a new concept. even if i didn't understand everything i learned, i go to prof or ta and ask them how to do it. then i understand the concept and i am satisfied with myself. i don't like english, because sometimes i never feel good about what i wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. i guess i'm just one of those people that feels complete when i conquer a task. but maybe that's how everybody is. sometimes i base my self-worth on if i did a good job on something or not. its self-destructing at times because i am a perfectionist and i tend to have expectations too high for myself.

"ever since i came to the university of texas i have been thinking about playing soccer. i turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. i wanted to come here because i know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. after going to the football game i could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 80,000 people. i can picture myself right now dribbling 5 players and scoring a magnificent goal. every one around me would be cheering like crazy and i would be the big man on campus. right now, i am wondering if i have made the right decision whether or not i should have come here. not only did i do very well in soccer, but i also got very good grades in high school. so, i made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. as of now i am glad with the decision i have made. i am having a blast over here. especially your class. it is the best. my class consists of about 540 people. that is a huge number. that was the size of my high school class in jersey village. in my psychology class right now i have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom i like. i am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if i kissed her. i am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. i know they must be very lonely. i just hope that their health remains in very good condition. i already told them that they have to live to be at least 80 years old. in high school towards the end i started to slack off. i told my parents that i would get very good grades so i have to study a lot this year. i am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. my sister is going to texas a&m and is majoring in psychology. if i ever need help or anything i can always call her. she is a junior right now. ever since i got here, i have been missing my cat very much. i have a picture of him next to my bed so i can see him every now and then. i can't wait to go home for the weekend. thanks!

"i am thinking about the video game i just tried to order over the phone. it angers me that it is sold out. i am now thinking about this assignment. it comes to me that i would very much like to make a superb grade in all my classes. i think that perhaps i shall if i apply myself. i am glad to think that i can do well in school. my thoughts now focus around a girl in my philosophy class who has the cutest face i think i've ever seen. i am trying to figure out a way to talk to her. i think it will have to be classrelated. there are two other girls in that class that i think are attractive. the class itself is very fun as well. i have a lot of work to do this weekend. i suppose i should get straight to it when i get home from class today. damn, i have to work out. i used to dislike working out because of the physical discomfort, but now it's merely an issue of time. time is the one commodity i am exceedingly greedy with. i am now thinking about how to best manage my time this weekend. i am more or less caught up in this psychology class; i now have more time to work on the others. i think i will get caught up on reading in english, and then turn in my paper. i paused for a moment there in my writing. i was thinking about what it was i was going to do today in the gym. i realized it was leg day. leg day is excruciating, but short. oh well, i will live. my thoughts wander back to women. i would very much like to get better acquainted with all kinds of women on a casual level. i need to expand my pool of female friends. even as we speak, a plan of action comes to mind. school makes it easy to meet new people. i simply have to turn off my shyness. i paused again in my writing. i was thinking about the study section in computer science i was about to go to today. the ta in that study section speaks very poor english. i will go because i understand the code he puts on the board enough that i am well ahead of his thinking during that hour. the other students are not so fortunate. i figure that they'll survive. the class is a breeze. it is not very challenging, unfortunately, but i am learning a bit. ""easy learning i call it. "" ack, the image of a naked female just popped into my head out of nowhere. why did that happen? sometimes chaotic thoughts pop out of nowhere for me. at any rate, i am now thinking about what i should eat before class. cereal. when in doubt, you cannot go wrong with cereal. hmm, still struggling to get that nude image out of my head. i don't need distractions right now. i need a clear, controlled mind. i am thinking of how much i have in my bank account and how i will manage my finances this month. i am somewhat poor. this will change when i graduate, but for the meantime. poverty. i'd like to think that i can be rich one day. i can see myself driving nice cars, living in a nice place, and wearing nice clothes. i can see myself managing my own time, and i can see myself being satisfied as far as that goes. money isn't so important to me, but freedom of time is, and the only way i can see myself having free time is being wealthy. oh well. c'est la vie. it seems my time is about up, but my closing thoughts dwell on responsibility and what it is i plan to do in school.

"m exdcited. all classes seem interesting. i'm way on top of the medical school admission process and i keep thinking about it. i am so ready for school. summer school was fun this summer, but for some reason i just enjoy havin the challenge of shool on my hands. it makes me feel successful. that's important to me. i have to make sure to stop and smell the roses also, though. i can be kind of bad about forgetting to do that. but then again succeeding in school is one way i smell the roses. everything here is so exciting. there are so many girls and i really dig that. i have never seen so many girls in my life. but even with the massive amounts of women that are here, my love woes are the same. i'm just too damn picky. yeah, yeah i know that's supposed to be good and stuff but it gets old. it seems like no girl ever meets the qualifications. it's like the really pretty girls that i am attracted to are stupid as hell. and the ugly girls or mediocre girls i know have the most wonderful personality in the world. what's up with that? so goes college life. despite the lack of girls with any character and looks, its still a thrilling experience. i feel sorry for women. i mean they are totally forsaken in almost all aspects of life. they are judged so much more on how they look, and what bugs me about that is i totally participate in all of the judging. so goes manhood. i like to think of myself as much different than other guys. someone who is more compassionate and has thought things through, but even i revert to complete childish mentalities sometimes. it can be fun though. girls, though, i remember a few weeks ago before a taekwon-do testing, in which i was to help judge (i used to be a taekwon-do instructor), one of my good friends who started taekwon-do with me was also invited. her name is joanne walker. the head ""male"" judges decided that she should watch over the receptionists desk while testing commensed. that was such bullshit. she outrankedhalf of the judges, but just because she wasn't more ""assertive"" as they put it, she got looked ofver as usual. this fucking pissed me off. i mean, for the first time i realized that this wasn't the first time this has happened to her. whenever i won a tournament, it was my name mentioned, whenever there was an award tobe given, it was to be, never to her. i know that the instructors didn't do it on purpose, it just never occurred to them to give credit to the lady. and then it hit me, ""wow, girls totally get looked over, more than guys. "" enough about that. i am bored. i want to go play with all of the other college kids in the other room, but no i am disciplined, rooooaaaaarrrr. anyway, man i hope the astros go to the series this year, i know that they can beat the braves (maybe). hehe oh, i saw this thing on latrell spreewell today, that professional basketball player who hit his coach. what a fucking idiot. man, he was sitting on tv talking about how he was suine the nba for lost wages. poor millionare. something about mary was very funny, and oh my god, was saving private ryan awsome or what? i mean that movie freaking changed my life. and good will hunting was good too. i liked it partly because it was in boston, and i would love to go medical school at harvard. i think i have a good shot at getting in if i do well this year and kick ass on the mcat, don't worry i will prepare well. football, this next saturday, oh yeah! i can't wait to enjoy the game witht eh buddies and a few budweisers. that budweiser commercial is hilarious, with the lizards. that is a genious whoever came up with that campaign. there are too many stupid-ass commercial advertisers out there. there should be a law against commercials that suck. like we could havwe a commercial selection committee that could pass a commercial on a 2'3 vote on regular commercials and by a simple majority with little caesar commercials. oh remember that deep thoughts, by jack handy that used to play on saturday night live? it was hilarious and this stream of consciousness essay reminds me of that. he would say stuff like, i wonder what the world would be like if dogs ruled the earth. i bet doverman pinchers would control most of the countries, but that would be sad because i'm sure there are some chiuahauas with some pretty good ideas! hehehehehe, i freaking hate that i don't know how to spell chiuhua. ahhhhhhhhh!

"gone with the wind i am and away i look out into the empty space of eternity with nothing. i awake into the morning darkness hearing the buzzing noises and look at thee general electric alarm and press snooze while i squeeze in 1 hour of extra sleep. i watch tv and walk the whole day and then i go shit in my public restroom with feces flowing from my colon down to the toilet. oh yeah i say as i struggle. i often have a tough time. no, i don't. i don't know why i am saying that. i brush my teeth and develop anger and excitement at the same time. anger for what i ask to me as i am me but do not know who you are. who are you and why do you exist i say? then i look out the window and see big yellow neon lights expressing wells fargo. i take a shower with no showerhead pressure and i get pissed off! i want nice warm water and a nice showerhead. the force is strong as i see red marks become apparent on my not so hairy chest. i get the urge for herbal essence but see to see that i do not have any. do you have the urge to say oh yes? i am away and out of the blue and in the light of things there is nothing. darkness exists as a prerequisite of life. what is this doh homer simpson says. donuts and coffee i must have soon. soon enough to satisfy my craving for ihop pancakes and a nice morning breakfeast at a nice restaurant. i go down the elevator. stupid ignorant people who live on the first five floors are too lazy to walk down the stairs. i had a firedrill today. how annoying the pulsating noise was. and how tiring. i could not imagine how firefighters climbed up to 78 floors on that clear, but smoggy morning on september 11, 2001. my love for skyscrapers has grown more and more. everyday, my passion and desire to see new and taller buildings arise grows larger and larger! i wait to see what will be done with the hollowed ground-zero. perhaps nothing will be built, but i hope for something. tennis is a very vigorous sport. the agility and the swift hits of the nice yellow ball that i throw around to my dog with. oh i love my dog. nice gold fur blows in the wind as i see a slow motion love seen in the mix of progress and then he starts to hump me. humpty dumpty sat on a wall. but then he fell off. i forgot how the riddle goes. the itsy bitsy spider climbed up to window is it? who cares? not me, for i am no longer in kindergarten but in college, the usa's largest college-ut! whoohooo! i have the urge to get drunk perhaps maybe have fucking good sex. perhaps smoke something illegal or not? my room-mate has just farted and he says sorry. i don't care. the smell is of essence. nice allure should be made into such a fragrance and entitled el natura. body works in different ways. my stomach is hurting. i have been having a bloating stomach the whole day. it is like a balloon filled not with oxygen, but with helium. if i could only float in the air and swim in the sea. fly up in the air. perhaps the ultimate luxury would be to eat tabasco flavored cheeze-its when i am perhaps high in the sky. oh yeah. good 'ol times rock on forever. forever i must live like that. drunken little bastard i must be during this year. ambitions thrive to do well, but will i? parents constantly pester me with do well in class viju-baba. please do well. of course the usual response is the usual for almost everyone else. i will, comes out of my mouth. deep inside i have the heart to do whatever i want, but it is the concentration that i lack. i do not like being forced to do something that i do not agree with. it is simply at its upright most stupidity. stupid is as stupid can be but who is stupider than stupid? everyone is judged at different levels. ignorance is bliss honey. bee's fly around. i have never been stung by a bee or wasp. speaking of being stung, i like the singer sting. he is a good singer. anyways, speaking of other things, i think things are the way that things are and that things should be left to the way that things should be. why? because they are things that obey other things, not stuff. yes. i need to pee, but must i? flaming whopper commercial's thrive in the background of my head as i feel the urge for el penetrado. oh yeah. the music is playing and i must go now. bye bye and bye!

"wow i can't believe i waited this long to write this paper. i was in a shock when i found out that this was due tomorrow. deadlines motivate me more than ever. i told myself that i was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but i guess getting it done is what is most important. i just played some starcraft with my roommate. i used to play this game with all my friends from school before war craft iii came out for the computer. this game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework. i'd have to say this game was the devil. it made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game. i told them i would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting. my parents somehow figured out that i started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out. this wasn't a very good feeling. well, anyway, this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago. somehow, all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time. this was extremely strange because i didn't tell anybody about this news. i tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions. this aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak. a few friends from houston already know. i mean, what's the big deal. i don't understand why gossip can travel so fast. i guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people's lives. i think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others. i find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be ""what's up"". the basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person's life. this type of conversation doesn't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong. figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing. you never know who's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person. i figured my actions didn't speak that loud. but any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other. it immediately captures the center of attention. i think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are. this is not an easy task. starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes. changes in friendship, responsibility and so on. college is a good way of determining who your real friends are. these are truly hard to find. i knew this girl that had about 3 parties a year. there would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company. but one time at lunch i saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too. it's crazy how things can turn right around like that. well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not. my friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and i think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship. we hardly ever talk about serious matters, so this was refreshing to me. i hang out with a bunch of guys that aren't really open to their feelings. we seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we're just buddies. i mean we'll be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking, especially about relationships. we'd always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not. i always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt. but this was never the case. three out of the four guys go to school here in austin but the fourth person is in san antonio. i can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends. everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but i feel obliged to back him up. i know it's all in fun but after a while i think it's just mean. i miss the guy too. i hope he makes it to austin next year.

"keep an open mind. ""if you can't change your mind, how do you know you still have one?"". anonymous. i read this quote today morning and started thinking about it. do i really have my own mind or am i controlled by thoughts and opinions that other people have? maybe everything i do and believe in is based on what somebody else does. obviously there are a lot of things that i believe in because my family'friends believe in them too. my faith in god may have been initially because of my parents faith in god and because of the stories that they told me about the god and his greatness. why do i say his greatness. i think about that a lot of times. why do we always say he?. why do all laws and sayings start with man is, he is. why don't we say. woman is ?i remember once my brother and me had this big fight about this and he being the mcp that he is says that women spend most of their time criticizing men. while on the other hand men do more constructive things. he says that most of the time it's the men who research and find laws and then later women complain about how the theorems or laws are sexually discriminating because they say he and not she, but i know that things are actually a lot different. i come from india and there a lot of women are oppressed. female infanticide still takes place. i come from a girl's school and a lot of our topics for discussion in school were about these things. whether women should be allowed to join the armed forces. which brings me back to the same thing. why am i a feminist? is it because most people around me were like that or is it because i believe in equality myself. but what do i believe in. hopefully i will be more clear about this after my psychology classes. but will i change my mind about something that i believe in very firmly now, will i change my opinion about something if somebody shows me some evidence that proves my belief wrong. i don't think so, but then that means that i blindly believe in something for no apparent reasons. that's pretty ridiculous. but i know that the mind is very fragile and i think that it's the situations that actually control the mind. like do i make friends because i want to or is it because i have to. sometimes i wonder about the way i choose my friends. is there something common about all of them. maybe there is a certain characteristic that i look for. i also know that i am very judgmental. i will not approach somebody that is dressed in a certain way. so what does that say about me. i look around and see so many people who look so different from me. i feel pretty intimidated by them. since i'm new to this country and this lifestyle. sometimes i feel so stupid and ignorant. but i also think about how every new change that i make in life changes me and makes me somewhat a different person. so maybe i do change some of my opinions over time. i wouldn't know. does anybody know how the mind works i guess nobody does.

(at least sitting at the desk--- the ones i had, unfortunately, to deal with!) they were so rude and just did things at their own pace as if the students don't have classes or things to do. it was so annoying that the lady wouldn't let me fill out the permission form myself. i mean, i'm in college for god's sake! i can read and write and understand things pretty well. i think i can fill in the blanks for a unique # myself -- she wouldn't let me take it home since i hadn't decided which exact class of the 6 that i wanted. then i had to come back the next day and wait in the long line again and deal with the same rude lady. i know their jobs are tedious and boring, but i don't like having to deal with adding and dropping either. you know, i just want to do it on tex but i can't anymore! the biggest pain was all the running around i had to do for this and the frustration it gave me! i had to go to the professor's office find out his hours, then go to his hours the next day, sit in on class, find out that he doesn't accept late assignments and i've already missed 2 because of not being there, then trying to do the homework, getting the book, doing the homework, getting help from a friend, going back to the math dept. to find out if there was an opening in the class which there wasn't, going back at 8am to wait until they decided to open their doors around 8:45, find out the professor i wanted still doesn't have an opening and almost having to go through the whole process again, but the lady finally being nice to me and letting me go into another class and another professor without getting all the stuff signed. she said we were the last 5 people to get in and they had to take us so we didn't (thank g-d) have to go through it again. now lets just hope i can understand this professor and that maybe he'll let me make up the assignments i've missed. i used to like math, but at the moment i am very ticked off at he entire idea of math because of this whole ordeal. in every other aspect of the university, or in many of them but not really all, i feel like i matter and i am not just my ssn. but dealing with this i feel like i am just being pushed around and can't get what i want. i know i won't always be able to get the classes i want or the times i want, i didn't get exactly what i wanted even registering in the first orientation this summer, but i am definitely lucky in that i got almost what i wanted it seems to work out. i just feel so unimportant because of this math dept. lady who could care less about me and my problem. i really expected her to tell me i had to go through the whole procedure again. maybe she does have a heart since she didn't make me do it. i don't know. i just feel so, so small and belittled i guess. i don't know how to put it, i just feel bad in some strange way. other than that problem and a few others that i need to take care of, i am really doing well here. i really feel at home and that i belong here. coming from atlanta, ga and moving, i know i'd love it, but i tried not to get my hopes up too high so that if things didn't work exactly as i planned i wouldn't be disappointed. i guess it worked because i do have to deal with these few problems and another big one, but i am still loving it! i am so glad to be here! i really feel like i mad the right decision. i'm meeting so many people and some of them i've already become great friends with because they are already caring and helping me with my problems and i'm helping them too. i'm really making some great bonds here! i feel so loved! and they don't call me to go out because they feel badly for me or anything, i feel that they genuinely want to hang out with me. maybe that's just my perception but i really feel that way. and now i'm questioning myself, but i am serious and not just trying to make myself believe that. at least, i think so. but now i think i'm analyzing it all too deeply because i'm thinking -- but what if subconsciously i'm really just making myself believe that. i don't know. but i truly feel that it is a genuine feeling that i have that my friends are true friends for true reasons! ok. i think i'll stop here before i analyze every bit of this!

"i have to go to the si unit and then the crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet ann and chad for dinner. i should have some time tonight to do homework. i'm still tired from last night, maybe i can take a nap sometime today. otherwise, i can always sleep in tomorrow. having only afternoon classes will be interesting. my lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. it's such a difference from the chem labs. i'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. i hope my physics lab is easy as well. one can only hope. not having lab the first week is nice. it worked out well so i could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. it's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. i'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. i hope that's not an indication of how much she cares about the renters. at least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 20 years that knows everything about this place. it's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. i think it's fate we moved in here. after all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. i still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. i can't forget to meet dan at 10am on monday in the pcl to work on physics homework. it's 6 pages long. i hope it's as easy as the first homework. it still took a while to finish though. from 7pm to 1am. this time i'll start earlier. i'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. i have a lot of reading to do and 2 tests to study for. i need to start seriously studying the pcat. i can't believe i almost missed the deadline on that again. this is ridiculous. i hope i get into ut austin. that's the only place i'd really like to go. except maybe ucsf or university of washington. ucsf is probably too expensive. i'd want to live in san fran when i have money so really i only want to got o pharmacy school in austin or seattle. the only thing about seattle is i hope sylvia has gotten cleaner. i know she never cooks anymore, so probably. we'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and i might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. that's going to be expensive. i hope whatever happens, mom and dad aren't disappointed in me. they need a web page for pac so i know when i need to get in line and for what. the draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information i need either. maybe next year i won't buy either. it's so much of a pain. i don't even feel like going. i bet that's how they make their money. i don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. i know they were trying to improve that, i wonder if that went through. probably not. as a whole, ut just cares about money and not the poor students. that's why alumni get everything. good luck to the ""sick"" staff.

"what is my problem? i have got to be the biggest bum on the planet. does that mean i have some kind of psychoanalytical problem? i don't know about complexes and childhood mistakes but i do know that there is really something disturbingly lazy about my attitude towards things. what kind of person could put his entire future on the line by not taking care of his college responsibilities? i am that kind of person. i'll probably drop out of college or something and what's even worse is that i see the problem staring me right in my face but i am either to lazy or to apathetic to change my situation. maybe i am a combination of both. honestly, what will my parents say? well, my dad will probably be relieved that i came back home to him. not in the way most families would be relieved though. he would just have another speech to hang over my head after every other mistake i may make in the future. he will probably totally dominate on me like he used to back in the day. he literally did not care about how you felt. maybe that is not quite accurate. i am convinced that he cared about people, and he cared about the family structure as a whole, however his total control over everyone in the house was clear and unbinding. he probably would have defended us with his life, i am sure of it. it is ironic; he would die for us but he wouldn't compromise with us to save his life. compromise? never! god forbid! i know it cannot be that hard to prioritize. wait a minute. how funny is that? i of all people have no business trying to tell someone to prioritize especially when it will be a god sent miracle if i turn in all my assignments this semester. but maybe, just maybe i have stumbled on to something here. i mean, well, what is the point i am trying to make? maybe i recognize similarities between my persona and the people i have associated myself with over the years. duh that's a no brainer. but it is interesting the way one can tell. with my friends it is very, very easy to see that we all talk and act and think alike. sometimes we deliberately change ourselves to fit the mold. with people you dislike it is very different though isn't it? it seems that what we see in them we hardly see at all. i can feel, if almost by instinct, that he and i have some very serious related issues, however one doesn't just stumble over them in his summation of the days events. a person has to be writing on a day very much like today, working on an assignment, very much like this one, following his ""stream of consciousness.

"well i think this is a fun experiment. lets see, what am i feeling? i'm sick. and i can't stop sneezing and coughing. which is distracting as i try to write this. i'm not sure but as i'm writing this i go back and correct my spelling mistakes. i love rings i need to get some more. i only have one on my middle finger and its really pretty. man i can't believe i didn't say hi to brian this morning when i saw him. its so pointless to act like i didn't see him when i looked right his way this morning. god i hope doesn't think i'm some kind of moody bitch. i feel incompetent. i have no specialty. last night i tried writing 2 songs but it doesn't help that i don't know anything about songwriting or reading music or coming up with a beat. although i must say i have things to say. so at least that is good. i'm annoyed with myself for getting hung up on things that already happened. wait am i doing this wrong. this feels more like a journal entry than just what am thinking in the moment. ok i need to stop reading what i just wrote. this room is dark i should open the blinds and jeez if my nose could just stop running. man i'm tired of typing already and its only been about 9 minutes. i need to call maz and ask what is up with our friend who i emailed 2 days ago and has not responded yet. i wonder if he is still in egypt and maybe doesn't have access to a computer. i want to paint my bedroom a light green or yellow color. does that say anything about me. god i feel nauseous. i don't even know how to spell that word. i have to stop eating weird combinations of food. i just had peach yogurt, garlic and parmesan cheese its and graham crackers with milk. i don't even have room for lunch. i must work out. god beyonce has a nice stomach in that baby boy"" music video. if i could lose another 23 pounds that would be awesome. i just need to work out. i need determination. that is such a powerful emotion. i need to buy more shoes and clean up this mess in my room. but it seems i clean it every other day. ok now i'm freaking out. i have 3 tests this week and i feel a little lost is most of them. boy i need some will power to . man i can't get over this nasty feeling of what i just ate. i feel so lost. what do i do. maybe a nice shower might help. oh only 30 seconds left. this went by faster than i thought it would go. and times up . i'm done!

"i am doing this at the last minute and feel bad that i am but we do not have internet access at my house right now because our america online is on the fritz but i am very happy that i can do it at the library. now that i have been typing for three minutes i feel more relaxed and confident, i hope that this computer will submit this to you after i complete the assignment. i have a lot going on in my life at the moment, pledgeship is taking its toll in me and consuming a lot of my time and at least my business has slowed down at the moment. i have a little time to catch my breath. i am very pleases and excited with ut and look forward to getting back into my groove and having a set schedule. pledgeship is taking up a lot of time but it is only for 8 weeks and that is good i need a date for the party this friday night and am a little preoccupied with it. , there are a few girls that i have in mind and would like to take and of course i want to make a good impression at my first pledge party so i will look good to my fellow pledge brothers. my pager just went off which means that i have another job to go do and i will do it tomorrow i hope that i am doing the correct thing for your experiment i firmly believe that there can never be a random experiment because once a person knows they are being experimented on it can and will influence their outcome. this is what i told my statistics teacher when we were discussing random surveys. come on have you ever been in the mall and somebody asks you to do an experiment and you slightly alter your answers because either you were embarrassed or the like, sure we all have and that is why people are not truly random i believe that we all have logarithms that are inherent in our minds, kind of like blueprints or instincts that tell us to act of do certain things and with these being in our mind we can never truly be random. if broken down to the lowest level a pattern would form and from this pattern we would be able to predict responses and behavior thus disproving the theory of randomness my time is about up i hope that you have enjoyed listening to the voice in my head and i also hope that you will see things with a different perspective now. if you don't that's okay because not many people think that the random theory is true anyway. but i do.

"it's 6:48. i think i'll type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top. as i sit here, looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard, i wonder what my girlfriend is doing since i am using her computer. can't wait till monday! i finally get my own internet set up at my apartment. i feel like i'm getting sick. i was sneezing a lot the other day, now i have a slight sore throat. i wonder what the purpose of this assignment is. is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work? gah! i hate this runny nose! my girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me. a little too many? hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now. i need to find more time to go to the gym now. going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isn't that good, right? wow. i feel like my ex-roommate. all he ever did was study, go to the gym, and hang out with his girlfriend, too. i wonder what i'll do for dinner tonight. i should eat healthier. learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help. i hope i'm doing this assignment correctly. oh well, if i'm not, i can just ask a ta just to make sure. it's only been 6 min and 15 sec? wow, this is going to be longer than i thought. oh look, it's bloat (a toy from mcdonalds that was in the movie finding nemo). what a great movie that was. best children's movie i've seen in a long time. i'm feeling more ill now. this can't be good. maybe i shouldn't go out tonight. ugh, that's right- i won't be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over. oh well, i've been spending a lot of time with her recently; it's understandable. i need to find some tissues. there's a roll of paper towels and toilet paper. i think i'll grab some toilet paper. hahaha- it's just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes; the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper. *sigh* i miss those good old simple days. a lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then. it was good to be young. i know what i'd like to do right now! i want to play counter-strike! too bad i can't install it onto her computer. i wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she"" is. should be obvious, so no worries. what homework'reading assignments do i need to take care of this weekend. hmm, i'm taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now, i still need to do that one experiment (which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and i can't go any further!), leb, fin?, maybe a little cms reading? i think that should take care of it. oh wait- got to do the eco self-homework tomorrow. look, she is back! aw, she is tired from working out. what?! she just told me how ""everyone"" has commented on my latest pictures on her board! apparently, people think it's a good picture of me. i guess it is. i actually like those pictures of me (which is kind of rare). i wonder if i can type like i do when i'm online- grammatically incorrect! that would speed up my typing. look! i'm at 19 minutes now! 19 is a great number. all done now!

"right now i feel as if i need to sleep. well i at least need to start sleeping on a regular schedule. i have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. i think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. i also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and i think that i still have senioritis. i just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades. i am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that i had this summer. they are actually things that i am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that i had to deal with in the summer semester here. i absolutely love ut, i don't think that there is any way that i could have stayed at home much longer. i'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. i have even started to call austin home. this really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. i miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that i dislike being at home. i love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. i love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. i feel that i am a disappointment to them though. i am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. she got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like ut. i love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. we have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. right now, i am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. he drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. i think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. i really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. i also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is dance. i have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. i love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. but, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. i need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. aside from my weird sleeping schedule, i also am really weird when it comes to eating. i don't think that i have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. i think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. i do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. i have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. i know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. i do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. i hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. i am going home this weekend for my boyfriends birthday. i miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to ut. i don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. i have less than two minutes left and i have absolutely no clue of what to write. i think that after i am done with this i am going to go eat some lasagne. i have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. i think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.

"i am really tired today. i am also pretty homesick. it is my birthday. i wish that i was at home. i want to celebrate my birthday with my parents and sister. i want to go to my favorite restaurants. blue goose sounds really good, but why am i worried about good restaurants in dallas. i can get just as good or better food here in austin. i want a turkey sub for dinner tonight. i also want to go to get ice cream from aimee's with my friends, but i have so much to do. i have to review all of my notes tonight for my classes, plus i have to go to the sorority pledge class meeting at sometime. i better look up the time soon. i am glad i stayed in and studied this weekend. it helped me get organized and feel like i knew what i was doing. rush really made me crazy. i hope i like being in a sorority. i am scared because i don't party that much, and i don't want it to take away too much time from my studies. i know that i do have to balance my life. i have to make time to meet people nad have fun. i just never feel like i have enough time to do everything. i feel bad that i couldn't go to lunch with leisha today because i had to read my phylosophy, but i went to run and then to church this morning and i had to get my stuff done this afternoon to be ready for the meeting tonight. i wish that i was at home and could just relax and watch tv. i miss summer time when i didn't have to do too much. i hope all of my friends in all of their colleges are doing well. the birthday card from amy made me sad. it already feels like we are drifting apart from each other. even when i e-mail her, i don't know what to say. i feel like she doesn't care what is going on here because she doesn't know all of people i am talking about when i tell her what i am doing. why doesn't she tell me a lot about her life? i want to know what is going on, not just hi how's it going kind of stuff. i am so happy i know my roommate though. we have had so much fun together, and we keep each other sane. i get scared when i think what might have been if i had gone pot luck. i keep meeting people who have crazy roommates, but i think i really could have gotten a long with everyone. i have met the coolest people. that girl i sat next to in economics the other day, was really neat. i need to get her number. i like my sailor sis in delta gamma, but i am afraid to go out with her. i don't know if i can keep up with all of these ut people. they party way more than i do. i think i am going to go home this labor day weekend because the parties aren't a necessity to meet people. anyways, nobody who i talk to will remember me because they are all drunk. i don't understand why i go to these paries to meet people when i can't even have a coherent conversation with people, but i guess they are fun. i am so confused right now, but i think it will all start working out soon. i just wish that i knew everybody instantly and did not have to work so hard at meeting people. in high school i could see anyone and know them. like at the game last night, i hardly knew anyone, and in high school i could talk to anyone around me. i guess soon enough, i will make new and good friends, but i sure hope it comes soon. luckily, i have megan. she has kept me from being sad, plus i really like it in austin. i love walking around campus and seeing everyone. it is the prettiest campus, and i really like all of my classes. i am really scared about keeping my grade point up. i worked hard in high school and did well, but will it be enough for college? i sure hope so. i know my parents will be happy as long as i do my best, but sometimes i feel that is not enough. i guess i pressure myself too hard. i just have to keep listening to my parents advice to balance my time between relaxing, socializing, and studying. i will do my best. i know that it will all start being normal to me pretty soon. i just have to wait for the adjusting period to be over.

"my computer is spiffy. i decided to name it mara, which means bitterness"" apparently, but i was naming it after a character in the star wars books who is really cool. my computer gets in ""fights"" with a friend's computer. we type to each other over aol instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other. she named her computer screwtape after a demonic character c. s. lewis developed. it's hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up, i'm on to a new thought. i'm also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because i hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes. however, i probably won't be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because i am typing so fast. one of my friends is iming me, but i can't respond because i have to do this for an entire 20 minutes. i'm only at 4 minutes 50 seconds right now. i guess i can keep him waiting. he is one of the best friends you could ever have. however, i'm having a little trouble right now because he and i are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and i know she still adores him completely. besides, i think they're much better for each other than he and i could be. he and i are both too proud and arrogant. she is proud, but she doesn't think she knows everything. she is pretty zany. i met her back in the 6th grade and we've been friends ever since. our friendship has had its ups and downs, but it has never halted. i just couldn't hook up with her ex-boyfriend because that would be tacky, at least for the next couple years. i know she had be really upset and i could never forget the way they were together. fortunately, i think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me. speaking of romantic interests, there's a boy who lives next door to me who's pretty attractive. however, i think a lot of girls are attracted to him, so i would have a lot of competition, and i don't like competition. he seems like a really nice guy, though i'm thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot. one of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party, and apparently he came. i was locked away in my room, attempting to study because i have a quiz and a test tomorrow (actually later today, since it is now after midnight). i wish i could find a guy who wasn't so emotionally messed up or low in the self-esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away. speaking of which, chris hasn't e-mailed me back. he and i got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation, though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going. so anyways, right now he is avoiding me. i wish he would talk to me, because he is one of the few people i trust to be honest, moral, and to steer me from harm. and i need to talk to a guy like that right now. i seem to attract guys who aren't particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people. the irony is, they like me, they tell me, because i'm so moral, pure, and sweet. someone's knocking at the door. it took only 30 seconds to answer it. my roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab. she is really cool, probably one of the best possible roommates i could have. she is quite eclectic. she likes to knit, particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy. if i have enough energy, i fidget during lectures. i used to play with a hacky sack in high school. some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it. it was cool, because my teachers trusted me. i even was friends with a few. i went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago. i'm going to miss them. speaking of which, i need to e-mail mr. karnavas, my former bible'philosophy'greek teacher.

"my name is kate mayer. right now i am feeling extremely uneasy. lately i have been stressing out about everything, from school work to social matters. for instance, this week i have some type of homework due everday this week starting wednesday. last night i worked for five hours straight on homework. i had to make myself take a break and go to kin's corner and eat because i hadn't eaten lunch or dinner, there simply just wasnt enough time. anyway on wednesday i have this huge english rough draft due and the final paper is due on friday. i have a geology test at 8 in the morning on thursday, and i do not work well in the mornings, especially when i am stressed. i try to run in the kinsolving gym to take some of the pressure off me and it helps a little. i just get on the treadmill and go. thinking and making plans for the week and how i can manage my time wisely. i keep thinking that once the weekend comes, i will be okay. i'm going home to visit my family and friends and all my worries will be left here in austin. that scares me a little because i'm afraid i will be dreading coming back here because austin is my home now. that's another thing that gives me a little anxiety. right now i don't really feel that i have a home per say. i know that i am always welcome in victoria (my hometown) but i have a hard time considering it my actual home. kinsolving is my new residence but i feel uncomfortable calling it my actual home. i guess i just have to get used to it. even though i feel anxiety about this small issue, i do not feel much homesickness that freshman are supposed to feel for their parents and friends. i do miss them a lot but i have not been upset by the fact that they are not going to be around me for support or whatever i might need from them. i guess in a way i am really enjoying my independence. i was scared before i came here and i realize now that i am okay alone. there are a lot of times that i need to be with people and socialize but leaving my comfort zone is the best thing that i could have ever done. i have discovered so many things about myself that i didnt know i even had in me, such as my need for independence. right now my roommate just walked in. most people i have talked to tell me that they have spent about two hours with their roommate. i do almost everything withe mine. she is my best friend here. we think alot alike. our room is just the way we wanted it, if not better. there are 11 posters of famous celebrities like marilyn monroe and bob dylan. our room smells of perfume cause we both spray it non stop, not because it smells bad but because. well i'm not exactly sure why. my mind is going blank. thinking. okay there is no air condition in our room or if there is, it is extremely hot in here and we have a fan blowing all the time. i live in supplemental housing so this isn't an actual dorm room-i think it is some kind of storage room-but in any case, i like it here. it feels cozy besides the temperature. im thinking that if i still live here in the winter, i will be okay because it's always hot in here. who knows?! anyway i am extremely tired, it is so hard making myself get up in the morning and go to class. the only reason i get up every morning is because i'm so afraid that i am going to fall behind. actually, i feel that i am always behind. i do not procrastinate, or at least i try not to, but there's just something inside me that makes me feel that there is always something that needs to be done and i cannot slip up and get caught behind. i always leave extra early for things just so i will not be late. i have a math class right after my rhetoric and composition class, which is all the way across campus. i am always late for my math class and it bothers me so much. it scares me to miss the first few minutes of that class because i might have missed some important information like homework or some change in the schedule. i guess you could call it paranoia, i don't know. well, i think that since i've always been this way, i work well under pressure. i don't really like it but, but i'm so used to it. maybe that's a good thing coming to a big university. time's up!!

"well, here i go, writing for 20 minutes. this really feels weird, but i guess i have to do it. actually i am glad i am doing this assignment because i dreaded doing it and now i can get it over with. it's just that 20 minutes seems like such a long time to sit here and write about nothing. i just don't know what to do and i feel very uncomfortable. hmmm. princess diana died early this morning. i have felt so sad. when i first heard of her car accident last night i tried to pray for her, but i felt as she would not want to live but rather die. i have been reading and studying about near-death experiences and most people studied'interviewed have said that they usually do not want to come ""back"" after being pronounced dead. anyway, i think she is in a better place, hopefully there will be no media hounding her wherever she is at now. the ceiling fan in this room bothers me when it is on high. sometimes i'd rather be hot than have to hear the loud roaring noise. my dogs just came upstairs. i wonder what they are thinking about? do they think like we do? what could be going through their minds? i know i am supposed to write without worrying about grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. , but i do, and i try to correct everything as i go. i keep looking at the clock and time is going very slow. i notice we have two clocks now on the desk. one is new, a prize or rather a gift for purchasing something. this room has so many things in it. i wish it was a bigger room. i like spacious things, i hate to feel crowded. i seem to be complaining so much right now, i guess i am tired and a little sleepy, and get grumpy. why do we have some many things! so many papers, junk, wiries, toys things, things, things! do we need all these things? can we live without all this things? yes, we can! thank god! i can't stop writing but i would like to. oh well. i just thought about a bakery, h. e. b. bakery to be exact. i keep craving sweets, so maybe that is why. i saw a white cake with pink frosting. my sister also came to mind. hmmm, this is interesting because she is a professional baker and creates luscious deserts! it is so dark outside, i hate having the windows closed, i like to hear the outdoors. i love the outdoors. oh god 3 more minutes of this. i just feel like my mind is completely empty right now. i wonder if this happens when one is really tired? i feel very old today. i like this computer, i guess i am pretty lucky to own one. i'm sorry i have been so negative, but this is how i feel right now. however, my time is up , hip hip hooray! bye!

" hello looks like a journal entry. frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much pressure as a true journal might be. no, true journals (at least the ones i know) come complete with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. here, i might simply start to list adjectives. think i will. chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter, organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! ha! adjectives are fun. what to make of this phenomenal opportunity? don't be shy, be compliant. or just spew forth venom, anecdotes, general life lessons. inclination says talk about ""me"". here's what that is. or so we'll try. music, menus, frustration. solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. making waves the size of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. the color of the water is green. count the levels of meaning there. anaphor. hyperbole. homonyms. czech republic. czeska republica. the united states of my ass. could i say here that i want to ______ the president? protect identity. the blank might have been filled with ""make love"" or ""marry"" or ""help through important issues"". certainly not ""castrate. "" what else? looking forward to making a's lots of a's, because after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and ass kissing. discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. i know a quote: one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. "" that one's right above dad's desk at the office. why do i experience comfort in an environment less than rational? or organized? possibly the same reason i love psychoactive mindbenders (by this, of course, i refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) because true beauty in life exposes itself not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an indian buffet at which one can stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a western mind for validation. what else? i think this weekend i'm going to stimulate myself with something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. make normal people sense of the place so that when mom and dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their tongues. music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. takeover from an armchair. natural delicacies. tv numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math and science is god. school puts the kind of pressure on people that creates ted bundies. ut is anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a good idea. just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. i was the fool, caught in the wave of college matriculation, and still to this day i feel i need four more years. just like that fucking idiot gw bush. right now, and not because i endorse the use of any of the following terms, i'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that i rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when i open the floodgates. it's because i wanted to call bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red hand before any other utterance could follow. well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!! oh, i was going to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. how about cracker-ass whitebread honky guerro americano puto! that would be perfect for me. still, something about waspy racial slurs isn't nearly as intimidating as ""nigger"" or ""spic"" or daggerhead, or whatever. this world exists as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. it's going to suck till that evolution takes place, but god damn it, i'll wallow in the shit till i die and i'll like it. couldn't qualify, for that reason, as the typical ""good people"" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating around earth for some god or cause might hope. that's what makes music --- done. thanks for the toilet!

"i need to learn better time management skills. i'm so glad that i can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. oh wow! what's up with that teacher? i do feel sorry for her though. i know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. afterall, i was only on the computer last night for four hours. and i can't believe i allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! but you know what? i figured out that i can get a lot of work done as long as i do it outside of my dorm room. i also figured out why people say silence is golden. (though personally, i don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) oh my gosh! i totally found a gift from god today! i was sitting in the study lounge in jester only to stumble upon a study group for 408k. and it was definitely a blessing to finally get into teranchi's class. i can't believe theresa and my new friends are in there. though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. now i can email theresa or maybe call up katherine. (i talked to katherine today infront of jesta pizza and she's taking 408k too. ) i got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 408k homework. the only thing i'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that coco and rubes are in this new class as well. i'm not sure if i'm at a stage where i could answer questions as i'm trying to learn them myself. and though it sounds kind of bad, i really need to get an 'a' in 408k. maybe i can review it this weekend and then i might be able to help them next week. oh wow, next week! i have tests coming out of nowhere! but today was refreshing considering the fact that i'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. if i can do that in one day. time management here i come! it's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. well once i'm done with this maybe i'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. oh yeah, uh huh! i kind of wish i was a speed reader. i wonder if i'd actually get to party a lot more. dude, screw the parties me and henna are going to build a fort. how cool is that? that's just too cool! oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and pow there's your fort. oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous.

"but i can't go to sleep because i have mounds of homework to do. the drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why i didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. i still need to take a shower. then i have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so i can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the ta gives out. too bad, i am going to fail it. the lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. i wish that my best friend natalie and i could've spent more time together when i was home this past weekend. i also wish that my boyfriend mark would send me an email. i wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. it's hard enough him being in virginia, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. it is really making me mad, and sad all at once. i wish that i could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. natalie is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. but i hate boring her to death with it, i don't want to get on her nerves about it. this past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, i hate it. but there is nothing i can do about it. and then there is matt which just gets on my nerves. he is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 7 years. he just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. i just get so frustrated, and tired of it. poor guy, i feel sorry for him. then, my mind always, swings back to mark. i can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. i so need to talk to him about it because i can't function unless everything is resolved. and it is driving me absolutely crazy. but he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. and i am not the kind of person that can just drop it. i can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. i have it on me for quite a long while. every day, i see or hear at least 15 things that remind me of him or us together. its so depressing. i hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. well, i see that the 20 minutes are up now. so long.

"its been 2 weeks now that i have been in college. i havent made that many new friends, but at least i have been trying. i go and meet new people, peobably most of whom i will never meet again, but it's fun still to just go and meet people. i look at my friends from high school, and they just sit around with each other. to me, they don't seem to be getting the new life experience, high school all over again. i think college will be a great time to see new things in my life. maybe figure out what i want to be as a person. as far as girls, there are many on the campus, but i don't know how many i have a chance with. sometimes, i feel like my religion holds me back, but i know its something that i want to keep. its like a respect factor. i hope the girl is out there. i do regret sometimes when i know i should go talk to girl, but instead i just go somewhere else. im not that shy, but i feel girls always think they're being hit on. the better thing to do is to go for it anyway, and who cares what they think. the things that happen during this time in our life, i wonder if this stuff really even matters that much. i mean how much is this stuff really going to affect me later on, or should i even bother with all this stuff. people tell me that it does matter and its all part of life, but i don't really know. i think sometimes i think to much about what other people are thinking. like act differently towards different people, which something i don't like doing. also, i think i judge too quickly. i finally opened the door to the my dorm yesterday; stupidly i didnt do so before. i met some people, they seemed pretty nice. i want to meet some girls though, so if nothing else, my confidence will be boosted up. i usually not really needing self-assurance, but what can i say, it is a bit different here. as far as jennifer goes, well im trying to be friends with her. i think i can be, it doesnt really matter anymore. i think she finally realizes it as well. in life, i think we all make many friends, so it doesnt really matter that much i guess. also, i noticed when i make a point i think about the opposite as well. like maybe i should try to stay friends with her, what if she turns out to be a life long friend. i like it when im just in a relaxed mood, when stuff doesnt bother me. just chilling and not worrying about anything. school hasnt been that bad so far; i know i need to pick it up. studying hard right now will pay off for me a lot. i guess writing in a journal does help. it makes me feel releaved of some emotions. i want to go to that party tonight, but i don't know how i will get there. psychology class should be fun, i like the material we are covering, hope it's not too hard though. im worried about calculus, that class is going to be tough. sheena, well i don't know about her. she's cool, but i don't know. she's really hesistant, and i don't really trust her. seems like she's really good friends with a lot of people. i mean i want to make some new friends, meet some nice girls, and make good grades. simple goals. this 20 minute segment is really long. im getting tired of writing. i want to go club tonight, i hope i can get a ride up there. i have study too, so if i don't i can always just study. all the same.

"tired, stressed, already sick of school and it has only been the first week. what can i say other than i have to do great this semester. i never knew that school would be this stressful. there are so many things going on in my life right now that i really do not have time for. i feel like my brain is on overload and don't know when i am going to get all of this stuff done. hungry, what can i say, i am always craving something. i am sitting in my dorm room all alone because my friends have all gone out to this sig ep party and i opted to stay home and catch up on things that i need to get done. i hate typing too. although typing is a lot easier to do because it is a lot faster. i just hate it when i mess up and hit the wrong key. it really irritates me when my phone rings late at night and it is one of my friends from home and you can't understand a word they are saying because they have been out partying all night long. have you ever noticed that when people have had a little too much to drink that they get real emotional? when i returned home last night from being out, one of my friends from home was hysterically crying over something a guy said to her at a party. he commented on what she was wearing and obviously she took it the wrong way and got mad. of course i knew it was no big deal, but she really thought it was. this morning, of course, she ran into my room wondering what had happened last night and why she got upset. it was such a big deal last night, but this morning she was so embarrassed. i have done the same thing that she did. gosh, i miss my parents and i never really thought that i would. my senior year i was so tired of the high school scene. i think i was the only one of my friends that hated my senior year. well, i can't say that i absolutely hated it, but i was ready to go on to bigger and better things. my boyfriend lived here, so maybe that's why i wanted to leave home so badly. my phone bill is going to be so high this semester. i talk to all of my friends so much on the phone. i also talk to my parents a lot too. i especially talk to my mom. i was always so close to my mom and it is hard to be away from her. i could always drive home one weekend. it is not very far away. i just found out today that we are going to have to go to ten hours of study hall every week. it sounds bad, but i really think this is good for me especially coming into my freshman year and trying to get adjusted to this new life that i am leading now. i was always independent, but now i feel that i am on my own for good. i really like only depending on myself for things.

"a writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as i sit here i can remember all the papers that i have written. i usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what i have written before i continue. i can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. right now i'm thinking about where i need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. i wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. i looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. today is in fact my second day of school at the university of texas. i was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. now, i'm more worried that i won't be able to succeed like i did in high school. maybe i'm not so worried that i won't do well; i'm worried that it will be very hard and that i won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. well, i'm not a chemistry major, but i am a biochemistry major, so now i'm worried that i'm in the wrong class. i've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure i'm eligible for the class, and it appears that i am. maybe i just shouldn't worry. i also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. i'm basically a good student, and i usually don't disrupt the class. sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. i guess its not really a big deal, but i don't like getting in trouble. i'm one of those people who likes to do things i'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once i suspect that someone might find out, i'll try to get everyone else to stop. i know it is kind of hypocritical, but i just don't like to get in trouble. the words i dreaded most growing up were ""lisa, we need to talk. "" whenever my mother said that to me, i just knew i had to be in trouble. i would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what i did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. usually, it turned out to be nothing. i guess sometimes i worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. about a month before going to college, i spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. i guess i wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but i was crying about everything. it even made me upset that i didn't have my computer yet, and i wasn't leaving for college for another month. i just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how i wanted it to. plus i had a lot of things to do in august, and i didn't want to run out of time. it did work out, but i still became upset about it. i moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. for the past couple of years, i've told everyone that i want to be a doctor. now i'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. i can't even begin to imagine the debt that i will incur by trying to become a doctor. that made me want to look into other careers, but i don't like a lot of other things. maybe i can wait until i graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. i like to worry about everything. what i really like to do though, is to make lists. i love buying planners because i always write down my assignments. and i write what i have to do on thursday and if i don't finish that day, i write it again on friday to make sure i do it. i'm not that concerned if i don't complete my tasks, but i just want to make a list. my roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. i have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and i want to have music playing. it wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. i understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. i guess i'm just used to studying if i need to in order to do well. i just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time.

"as i'm sitting here at my computer i'm thinking about how bad i started off this semester. i know that i should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. i'm also thinking how tired i am from staying up all night studying. in the back of my mind i'm hoping to get this work study job so that i can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how i took 12 hours and worked this summer. i keep smelling my cologne (ck1) that i accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. a lot more came out then i expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. had i not been so tired maybe i would have realized that i only needed a couple of drops. not to mention everywhere i have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. i 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. i'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. my brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work i need to do. i'm homesick already. i miss my family and i have only been here a couple of weeks. i didn't expect this my sophomore year. i thought it only happened to freshmen. i feel really hungry too. i haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. i feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at gregory. i'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. but with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. i wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. i wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as i did. probably not because they all play sports. i think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. i think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. they don't. they have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. while fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. i think that is tough. i have sympathy for them. i hope that i can get everything done today that needs to be done and also i plan on changing my shirt before this ck1 gives me a headache. i probably will never wear ck1 again. i hope all my friends and family are doing well. i plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye.

"i'm currently thinking about what i just finished writing to dr. pennebaker about, my broken relationship. it was so beautiful, and the worst part is that the feeling, that beautiful feeling is still inside me. i feel it everyday: in class, before i go to bed, when i wake up. i remember the feeling of being with him, and i miss it. i miss him so much. i hate having taken him for granted. i hate the fact that things could have worked out, had i simply admitted to myself that i had fallen for a guy. that's all i needed to do. all i could do was ignore him, laugh at him, all this while trully knowing there was something else. i did all of this knowing that i meant none of it. i was fighting it! i was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth, all guys are the same. they're all jerks. be careful who you fall in love with. don't fall in love in high school, it's too soon. you have your whole life ahead of you. "" i knew they were only trying to protect me, i knew they were saying this because they themselves having been guys, knew what it is guys were after. but no, not hugo! he was different. he wasn't horny or all over me, or asking me weird sex stuff. not once did he do this. not once did he push me into something i didn't want to do. not once! we dated for a year, and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other's foreheads and cheeks. this was it. and god did he do stuff for me. i hated saying i needed something or felt a certain way in front of him, because he had always go out of his way to help-always! for valentine's day, he designed a shirt that said, ""monica, will you be my valentine?"" i remember that morning, walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something, knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me. i hugged him, nodded, and smiled. that was all he needed. i don't know what i wouldn't do to have those feelings all over again-with him!?! i dream about laying beside him, while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders. and just watching him breathe, watching his chest rise and lower, as he breathes. wow! such an amazing sight. now, all i have are our memories, most of them of me being a 'bitch' to him, treating him so unfairly. maybe he does deserve better than me, maybe this is all part of god's plan. but you see, i know god knows me and he knows i have a big heart, but am just afraid to show it. he knows this. he knows how sometimes, it's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection, or something or other. but what now? should i wait? i guess so. deep down, i have this feeling that it is not over between hugo and i by a long shot. i know it's not over by a lot. i remember how hugo treated his parents, better than i've ever seen anyone treat their parents, with such respect and love. i've always had this thing that a guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother. his dad also, that man is really such a good person. he really does have a lot to offer to his family, and i know hugo too is this type of person. i only hope he knows this about himself. i only hope he knows everything he is worth. i only hope that he knows how i truly feel about him, how i've truly felt about him this entire past year. i hope he knows that behind every crude and hateful action or word, there was an enormous amount of love just trying to get through. there was an enormous amount of love just trying to beat all the hate, and although it might have been a little late, it has been released. it has gone through all the hate. it lives in me today, right now, right this instant as i am typing, and will live in me for a very long time, if not-eternally.

"i'm so tired right now. i wish i could just sleep in my bed at home right now. man, my feet smells. i guess it's time to wash the slippers. gosh, right now would be a good time to get a nice massage. my back is aching now. when will i get used to this new change? i don't know if i can make it. well, i have to. i must. everyone expects me to. of course i expect myself to succeed as well but everything has just been so overwhelming. so much information is given in the class and i don't know what i should write down. ok. i'm tired of listening to the same song. what are they talking about? it makes no sense to me. alright. piano music is the way to go. yeah. this will relax me. i need to rest my eyes. can i type with my eyes close? no, i'll probably start typing some wrong stuff and then it'll be a waste of time. hm. i think i should put this printer box somewhere else. it's kind of annoying me in a way. but then again, i need to put my feet over it for support. books, books, books. i'm tired of them already. i can't believe i was actually excited about learning all this new stuff. now i'm dreading every minute of it. my forehead itches. i'm so bored. this is really crazy. my goodness, there's about twelve more minutes remaining. ah! i think i'm about to fall asleep on this laptop. hm, roommate's back now. i wonder if she ate dinner yet. she probably went to eat with her boyfriend or so. hm, do i need anything else for my dorm? i think i should decorate it more. it still looks a little plain at the moment. i guess i should utilize some of my time for creative matters. yeah. i should make more cranes and turtles to put around my area. aww. the crane and turtle on my laptop looks so cute. ouch. i bite my lip. where did roommate go? she left again already? maybe she is just now going out to eat since she came back with her backpack just now. i don't know. geez. now that guy finally decides to respond me. it's about time. i instant messaged him like a while back. hm. the asian talent show was quite interesting. that one skit by vsa was pretty cool. too bad the guy's voice was spoken by a girl. that made him seem pretty gay. oh okay. so it was a girl's voice because it was suppose to be the voice of a young boy. i see now. yay! i have four minutes remaining. so what am i thinking about now? oh man, jay is so fine looking. i need a bigger poster of him to put on the wall. gosh i don't like this chair i'm sitting now. it's not very comfortable. i feel like rolling back and forth but there arent any wheels. this sucks! hm. i should go work out tonight. i have not done that in about a week already. this is not good. i have to stay in shape. i don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like people say. either way, i just want to be fit. i think i should head out there right now.

"i just don't understand why things didn't work out. how can you honestly be so mean. i thought that you loved me. i loved you. i still love you. what went wrong? i can't remember what went wrong last semester, but i am sure you would remind me if you had to. gaw this song by john mayer reminds me of you. our love was so comfortable, so broken in. "" why did my parents disapprove of you and us? are you really that bad? are you really not that good for me? i thought i could trust my own emotions. why don't my parents trust me? or is it even a trust issue. can i really not love at such a young age? ug. so many questions running through my mind. why are you all i think about? wow, i wonder if this is obsessive. how do you even spell that darn word. haha. why do i always think in question form. man, i want to go see you so bad. i really think i am coming for your birthday. but am i going to regret it? gaww, everyone tells me not to go. but they should take their own advise sometimes. i mean they don't even think the bible is real. sometimes i feel like i am the only one who believes in god. how can i trust my friends advice when they don't even believe the same thing i do! if only i knew what god wanted for me. talk about a stressful time. i never knew college would be so difficult. academically i figured it would be but emotionally. wow. its incredible how much i have already changed. for the better? i hope. i think i have though. i just wish i had you back robert. i wish things could be like they used to. why did you even call and apologize for everything you did wrong? i know you still love me. why do you even want me to come see you? do you want to be back with me? i know you don't. or do you ? you have fun being single. why can't i? why can't i meet someone else to take my mind off of you. are you the one? man, should i even be thinking like this at 20? ha. maybe i am weird. oh well. this song is extremely depressing. i am glad my roommates aren't here or they would be making fun of me for listening to it. get over robert kimberly! get over him! if only they knew i am trying, so hard. gosh, its not like i have not prayed every night for gods help. i mean geeze. i don't think he is suppose to be out of my life. but then if he is not, why was he so mean to me. i would have never done that to him. never hurt him for anything. i guess i am a door mat. its not that i let people walk all over me, its just that i don't ever want anyone to feel what i have. why would i ever let anyone hurt on purpose? if i had to choose between myself experiencing hurt and someone else, i would take the hurt in a second. i hate seeing people suffer. i will suffer before anyone i love does. so does that make me a door mat. am i really too forgiving? people can change. or is that my fantasy world. i want to be with you robert. so why can't i? because of my parents? yeah right. i can make my own decisions. gaw, am i really that immature too? no! i am very mature for my age. he was always there for me when i needed him the most. he was my shoulder to cry on. yeah last year was tough and i may have been to needy and dependent on him. but the break up made me realize that and now i am not as dependent. i am fine without him and i realized i have to make myself happy. so why does not he want to be with me now? does he? he calls me all the time. tells me he loves me and misses me. wow i thought girls were complicated. lol. that is why i need to see him. i need to read his eyes. the second he looks at me i will be able to tell what he feels without him even saying anything. i am good at that. i can read people easy. i get it from mom. man she can see right though me. so then why couldn't she see how special robert was for me. gosh, i should seriously be thinking about something else other than him. like school. hehe. that is more important. but then he is too. he is everything i want in a husband when he is good. i mean he has his flaws but don't we all. forgive and forget. that is what i do. that is what pastor ball said yesterday. you have to forgive a person to enjoy them again. well, i have forgiven everyone i know. why can robert be forgiven. why can't they let him be apart of my life. i get so angry when i think about it all. i love you parents, but man you really messed up this time. i have forgiven you for it. so forgive robert. geeze, my hands are starting to hurt. lol. not used to this much typing. its like he is a disease. i can't get rid of him in my mind. now that is unhealthy. but i can push you aside when i need to. like tonight, way to much homework to dwell on him. yeah that is what messed me up last semester. to emotionally involved. but this semester i am so much better. i have control over my life again. yeah! but i just can't get upset if things don't go my way. i mean life has its ups and downs. and its not robert that i need in my life. i just need to keep god in my life and he will help me. but then again i wouldn't mind having robert too. hehe.

"i don't ever know what to talk about in these damned things, although i know that the point is just to write whatever comes to mind. nothing ever seems worth committing to anything besides a fleeting second of short term memory. my eye itches. i wish keith would stop singing that opera crap so i could concentrate on what i am doing. oh, wait, this is what i am supposed to be doing. my head itches. what am i going to do about elizabeth? on one hand, i want to be free to enjoy college life, having my own apartment, and the like, but at the same time, i wonder if pushing her away will be the biggest mistake i ever make in my life. sometimes i kind of wish that someone else were making decisions for me, or at least the tough ones. my stomach hurts a lot, thinking about this all the time. i hope i don't get a ulcer. that really would suck. my head itches again. i wonder what jeff is doing tonight; i should call him and see if he knows of any parties going on. i should probably take this keg shell back and get my deposit. is charlie here? he needs to call his mom. oh crap, i was supposed to call my mom back. it will have to wait though. damn homework. i wonder if i have anything else to do tonight besides this. economics. no, chemistry. no, philosophy. no, cool no other homework. i wish i could type as fast as i think, that would be nice. i hope my mom isn't too mad that i'm not coming home this weekend. she'll get over it. i hope she understands though; i wouldn't want to hurt her feelings. she really is good to me; so is dad though. i wonder if dad is back from his trip yet; he sure is out of town a lot. maybe he will retire soon, and live off mutual funds. he'll probably wait for katie to move out though. i wonder if dean will ever move out; maybe he's finally got his act together i hope he does, anyway. i wish i could do something to help him out if nothing else but to see where he could be, where his potential lies. i think even if i could find the words, he would not take the time to listen, or be willing to listen, one or the other. is time up yet? no. hmmm. what am i thinking now? all these question marks. makes me feel like the riddler or something. i wonder if that means anything, that my ""stream of consciousness assignment is flooded with question marks. apparently, there are still many questions in my life. will they ever be answered? more question marks great. so many questions, and not enough resources to answer them by. not to mention the fact that no one can help because no one else is in the situation. i wish there were some way to link with someone make them feel what you feel and know what you know maybe get some reliable advice for a change.

"well currently i am stressed out. it is as if i have so much to do and not enough time to do it. i get real frustrated and tired yet, things must be done. my academics take up a significant amount of time and then there's my extracurricular activities. i am so used to being involved to the point that i came to college and repeated the same cycle. my grades reflect this. i just want to get at least a 3. 6 and go to a decent medical school. my sorority's members are some of the most elite black women on campus, in the community and in the world. all of my friends want to become members. i am so nice to them which is not the proper protocol for interested people. my line sisters reiterate to me daily that i must learn how to be stern and forceful to them instead of befriending them. at our interests meetings we turn mean. how can i hug them on the behind closed doors and intimidate them at meetings. i don't want them to consider me a hypocrite and i want to maintain that level of friendship. they look to me for knowledge and direction instead of evilness and cruelty. my first mind is saying forget what people are saying those are your friends. my second mind is saying that they don't respect you and they feel as though the have nothing to prove because we are already friends. they'll learn when what's up y'all turns into, salutations and how are you. i have so much on my mind that i believe my mind is going to overload and explode. must do homework, must practice, must get involved, must go to work are just a few of my daily struggles with my time ",1,1.591541 -2.766796 -1.362606 -2.79936 -2.797462 0.56387 1.39525 1.455553 0.856004 -1.374283 -0.151333 -0.590446 1.270151 -0.28279 1.848585 0.0 -0.04277 -0.255485 -0.520286 0.769455 -0.341734 0.778033 0.7036 -0.174408 -0.624052 -0.143234 1.180757 0.051704 -1.735759 -1.725703 -1.100231 -1.430891 -0.62961 0.003227 0.836642 -1.109326 0.334526 0.238935 -0.883121 0.499909 -1.038726 -1.977191 -0.994928 -0.295008 -0.727057 0.196264 0.241417 1.248955 0.531977 0.938339 0.303977 -1.834628 -1.4461 0.143976 -0.772919 0.002214 0.823353 -0.954251 0.495627 -1.517455 -0.036131 -0.281449 -0.480161 0.149566 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.119931 -0.418348 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.312597 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.679223 5.023978 3.716835 4.368175 4.427979 4.876619
the one thing that i miss here at school is my drums. i couldn't bring them with me to college because there is no where to put them. i used to play in a band and people used to tell me that i was really good but then i stopped playing and i got worse. when they were always there for me to play i never wanted to but now i wish i could play them more than anything. my best friend is a drummer but he always kept on practicing and he got really good. so good that now he is moving to maryland to join a band. the band he is joining is pretty successful death metal band and they have two albums. i miss my friend and i hope that he is doing alright up there. he left all of his friends and family back in san antonio and he doesn't know anyone in maryland except for his band members and he really doesn't know them too well. i wish i could go up and see him and watch his band play since i am a big fan of death metal music. i listen to all types of music but death metal is definitely one of my favorites. i don't like it when people talk bad about death metal when they don't even know anything about it. i want death metal artists to be able to someday get rich off there music like all of the other pop artists. because the talent that comes along with death metal music is remarkable. ,1,-1.743066 1.898347 -0.174392 1.856951 2.001892 2.050991 -0.440738 0.104311 -0.61486 -1.525749 -0.080949 -0.590446 0.756992 1.243123 -1.144758 0.0 -0.04277 0.757676 -0.577702 -0.795527 -0.823749 -0.742368 3.269336 -0.564573 0.725779 -1.053939 0.109879 -0.093861 1.795586 2.803787 -1.100231 1.156133 -0.423088 -0.906028 -1.017959 0.777257 -0.469505 -0.069476 -1.015304 0.9523 0.389206 -0.902259 2.236848 -0.390691 0.184338 0.454839 -1.093488 2.385853 -0.198205 2.175092 -0.082681 -0.573613 0.46143 -0.010724 -1.167733 1.647436 -0.092577 0.641963 0.895763 1.471022 -0.299762 -0.085362 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.564185 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.557128 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.454754 5.244994 3.622697 5.244287 5.003303 4.387223
"i am really quite flustered right now, because i already wrote this assignment earlier, and the philosophy systems were probably down, and now i cannot retrieve the file from where i saved it. anyways, hardly makes a difference though. i can't help wondering about the purpose of this assignment. i mean, the teacher hardly even knows me, and probably cannot even relate to what i am thinking about. i guess this must be a way of doing research, and we'll eventually learn about it. i wish all assignments were just as simple. but its difficult to suddenly get used to this american system of education. this does get strange and intimidating sometimes, with large classrooms and lack of onetoone interaction. but it is nice, and i will definitely get used to it. today is monday, and a whole new week lies ahead. i quite dread monday mornings. not because i have to go to class, but because i have a slight fear of the unknown. what if i have forgotten to do an assignment, what if i annoy a teacher! i am really hungry. i had a small lunch last night. cafeterias were closed so i made some sandwiches at home. i wish i had a car. then i could go out anywhere and eat at anytime. i could even go to sixth street. i want to buy a sports car. i will buy an italian sports car once i earn my own million dollars! but that's a long way to go. i want to eat at kinsolving dining hall today. i am quite tired with the food at jester. but its pretty far from jester, and i hate to walk. i guess i'll eat in jester itself. i wonder what my friends back home must be doing, especially tanaya. i hope they miss me as much as i miss them. i can't wait to go back to india, but i don't think i'll get to go before summer. i bump into them online almost everyday, so i do feel quite close. but personal meetings are totally different things. my room is such a mess. i will have to clean it up. will do it on thursday. thursdays are wonderful. i have only one class, so i do all other work on thursdays. but this is not a good habit. i eventually end up putting off all my important work to thursdays, and then run out of time on thursdays even! i wish the weekend were longer. i need my own computer. i'll get one soon. i hope i get a good deal though. then i wont have to go to the lab each time i have to do an assignment. my uncle is dallas said he could get me one for a decent price. i will probably go meet him next week if it fits in my schedule. great, my 20 minutes are almost up. this assignment was fun. i hope that all the others are as much fun to do.

"i have an aching headache and coughing every five minutes. i can diagnose that i have a cold because of my symptoms. the symptoms plagued me for more than 3 days and will not go away. this is very upsetting because i am planning to go tubing with some friends on sunday. if this sickness is ongoing, i may not go tubing. i'm taking a lot of medicines to relieve myself from this sickness, but nothing is working. my frustration is aiding the sickness to persist. there's one class i'm having problems in. the class is microeconomics; i failed both quizes and so behind in my reading. i'll spend a lot more time studying for that class than any others. i always have something to do but my sickness is preventing me to fulfil it to my best potential. i met a lot of people and made new friends in college; it made me have a sense of belonging that of which i lacked in high school. after me sickness is gone away, i know that i will have a great time and have a sense of directrion in life. my floor is so friendly and nice. we go out together and a maater of fact we went to olive garden last sunday. i joined many societys like the pre-med adn pre-dent societies to better my future and put me ahead of others.

"as i start my third semester at ut, i feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once. first of all, i'm excited because this is probably the first semester that i feel truly comfortable with my life here. i am living with my sister which is so good for me. we get along really well and i really enjoy spending as much time with her as i can. also, my exboyfriend is at ut with me now. he is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now. but fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year (because he was still in high school) was good for me as well. it enabled me to find out who i was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at ut. because of our time apart, i made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him. so, this year, i not only have him with me, but i also have all the friends that i made last year so that i don't depend only on him. my best friend, unfortunately is not in such a good situation. her boyfriend came to ut this year as well, but because he was away from her last year, she spent very little time at ut meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city. she spent most of her time in houston visiting him. as a result, this year, she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people. although, i know that she's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her, i realize that if something happens to her relationship with him, she will be left with very few friends to turn to. since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships, i fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him. she barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him. but i try to hold this against her because i know that she is not trying to ignore me, but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend. but other than that, i'm really happy with my social situation right now. it is a really good thing that i have this support of all my friends at this time, because i realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career. i am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class. three of these classes involves building models, drawing orthographics, and designing. two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers. in the first week, i already am swamped. although i know myself well enough to know that i will definitely finish all my projects, somehow i still stress out about them a bit, just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters i will have to pull (especially when i think of the fact that i have 8:00 classes every day of the week!). and i would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that i will have to build because i know how expensive they get. but, i realize that with the huge load i have so far, working is almost impossible for me. if i could have my way though, i would work at a restaurant in town. i worked at pappasito's over the summer and i really loved waiting tables. i met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them. i think the reason i loved it so much was definitely because of all the people i met. there were mostly guys that i worked with and they were all so friendly to me. we would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work. i got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure. it was really great meeting people that in many ways were very different than me. it gave me new perspectives and taught me new things about myself.

"i don't like the fact that i'm not sure if i can print stuff in this library. it would be so much more easy if i had my own computer, but oh well sarah is probably getting one in a few days then i can use hers it is so crazy how much things have become computer dependent i never thought that i would have a class that was web-based. but it seems that most of mine are and its kinda good in a way because it is forcing me to actually use the technology thats out there i'm not very computer oriented but i think about one year of college will whip me into shape, speaking of i need to go to the gym, but i'm not sure that ill make it tonight maybe ill call jane and see if she has time to go wiht me. sarah doesn't really work out a lot so i've been doing it by myself it would be a good idea to get one of thoes little hand held recorders and tape my spanish lectures because he lectures entirely in spanish and i understand spanish stuff so much better the second time through that i think it would be a really good idea to tape him and then listen to it while i work out wow its only been five minutes its hard to do stuff like this when you know that tons of homework awaits you and you arent really looking forward to it. i'm so glad we have monday off a&m doesn't' even have this holiday but i guess that they started later than we did. i'm going there this weekend and i can't wait to see my closest friends in all the world because they all went there i'm glad i didnt even though i miss them dearly because i have been forced to meet all kinds of new people and i have met some really nice ones, not as great as my best freinds but then again its only been two weeks they all seem to be sticking together pretty much which i think i s pretty dumb because they are never going to grow up if they don't start spreading there wings so to speak. its kinda funny that i just happened to look at my watch and i have been writing for ten minutes now i always seem to look at it in 5-10-15 minute increments. maybe myu internal clock is really acurate or something. i dunno. i'm really tired right now even though i got a lot of sleep the other night maybe i just need even more. i need more sleep thatn anyone i know i wonder if i get more tired because i convince myself i didnt get enough sleep or if i'm actually really tired. i think i do get really tired becuase it starts to show on my face, i get horrible bags under my eyes and i just look gross. like right now. plus i am totally broken out, more than i have ever been, but i'm hoping that its just the stress from going off to colegio. who knows well see in about a week. why is it that sometimes your face turns red. i hate that so much i feel so exposed when that happens. i can feel it getting hotter and i think that makes me even more self concious which in turn makes mya face even more red. i wonder if people you don't know notice when you blush or is it not as obvious as it seems. i didnt used to blush but now i occasionally do a t really inopportune times . like today when a guy i think is attractive said hi to me i got all flustered. its so stupid i don't even know him and i've convinced myself that we are destined to be together. sometimes i am so unrealistic when it comes to relationships correction i am always unrealistic that is something hard for me to admit to because in admitting that i feel let down. i get really dejected when it comes to guys, and i don't theink that any good ones exist even though i know in theory that isn't true i just havent come accross anyone who has disproved it to me. maybe its because i don't attract the nice guys because i'm sending off a negative vibe that was on oprah the other day. they were saying how can you attract someone if you automatically have a bad attitude about it and think that they couldnt possibly be worhty of you. i dunno. i can't stop thinking all guys are bad just to attract a guy because i think that is the wrong motive for changing my opinion. its like in bridget jones diary she does stuff like that sometimes i remind myself of her except not as extreme. well of course not she was a complete lunatic. i wish my parents were not in ireland right now becasue i would looooovvvveeee to see them this weekend but i can wait i miss them so much i think because we get along so incredibly well its really abnormal i think no one else i know gets along as well with there parents as i do its really cool i thinkwow i went over the 20 minutes who would have guessed thats kinda weird everytime i mentioned the time i said wow. huh

"i am twenty-two years old and i still have apprehension towards computers. i don't really know why. i guess it is because of my lack of experience with them. i am also worried about the pre-testing. i tried to access the site but it would not let me connect. my boyfriend just told me that he thinks it is stupid that a class is relying on computers so much. at first i agreed with him, but as i am typing this, i am beginning to think that it is sort of cool. speaking of my boyfriend, he is currently in his kitchen heating up leftovers. i can smell them and it makes me sick to my stomach. oh well, i will get acclimated. i have something on my mind. but first i would like think about my day and my new major. well, i changed my course of study, but not really. for the past two years i have been in the school of architecture. i love buildings and i love to design. i sacrificed a lot to get into the school and not to mention adding on three extra years to my college life. it was such a major decision. well, i just entered into a new course of study, it is architectural interior design. the interior design program moved into the school of architecture so they beefed up the program and gave it prestige. back to my boyfriend. i feel like i had an emotional affair with his best friend. that really sucks. i can't seem to get the other guy out of my mind. i am even having dreams about him. i e-mailed him today. it was a big step ",1,1.583144 0.169527 -0.897563 -0.268477 -1.485321 -0.398206 0.666533 1.297751 0.632602 -1.453802 -0.208225 -0.590446 1.130122 0.207623 0.602877 0.0 -0.04277 1.640615 1.180094 -0.795527 1.030862 -0.742368 0.861808 -0.052933 0.636728 0.596186 0.798299 0.692275 -1.103047 -1.314572 1.373812 -0.625441 -0.155807 2.020637 0.308596 -1.109326 -1.055245 -0.793457 -1.114189 -0.761967 -1.038726 -0.731521 -2.064894 -0.93226 -1.429535 -0.298844 -0.377367 0.202929 1.20746 0.003618 -0.75654 -0.747775 0.532251 -0.179189 -1.202879 -0.510013 1.038253 -0.954251 0.058081 -0.819853 -0.918624 1.229545 -0.480161 1.174821 0.408025 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.653663 -0.010944 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 1.172128 -0.422267 -1.257277 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.139924 4.986928 4.195688 4.4028 4.975411 4.99157
"i don't know why, but for some reason i am extremely nervous about this writing assignment. it most likely won't even be read! random, but i started thinking about what an awful driver i am in austin. all of the one way streets and stop signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. i've already ran two red lights. whoops. since this writing assignment is online, i can't help but read the instant messages that pop up while i'm typing. i love talking to people online, i think i'm addicted. it really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family now that we are all living in different cities. especially since two of my best friends are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, i can talk to them all at the same time. it is very convenient. since coming to college i have become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. tomorrow night the sig eps are having an 80's theme party, so last night i spent about an hour downloading hit songs from the 80's. my friends and i are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. it will be awesome. today my friend melanie and i went shopping at thrift stores to find 80's garb. i found the best 80's pumps for only six dollars. can you say jackpot? i think my favorite 80's song right now has to be jessie's girl by rick springstein. i wish i was jessie's girl, because then i would date his best friend. speaking of dating, i think dating in college is going to be rather difficult considering there are approximately 50 gorgeous girls on campus to every one attractive guy. not that looks are everything, but that is what generally draws two people together to start talking. actually i think that is usually the case, but i am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the attractive hard asses. racquetball is my new favorite sport. i have played five times since i've been here. it's really the best work out. it's so much better than running for 20 minutes. just play racquetball for 45 minutes and you can't breath. it's such a great feeling. i have had a few complaints though, because i tend to accidentally hit the person i am playing with a little too often than necessary. i've hit my sister like twice and i couldn't even guess how many times i've hit christy. whoops! i love going to concerts. they are probably on my top 5 favorite things to do list, along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. i wish we had some snow nearby, but i would hate to live in the cold so i guess i don't really want snow close by. i almost went to school in boulder, colorado but i realized i would have to wear about 5 layers of clothing just to walk to class and i decided it just wasn't worth it. i am a texan, if i didn't break a sweat between classes i don't know what i would do with myself. i can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new college friends. i have been looking forward to that for a ",1,-1.155525 0.758308 1.004789 0.888947 0.090813 0.466752 0.810267 -0.276019 0.032928 -0.3481 -0.148869 -0.222594 0.884495 -0.56415 1.08767 0.0 -0.04277 -1.198713 -0.205098 -0.239688 -0.280941 -0.202363 -1.119326 -1.544502 -0.624052 -0.067 0.384435 1.520657 0.403912 1.050048 -0.281238 1.368745 -0.538616 1.031626 -0.688608 -0.671834 -0.309505 0.978129 -0.254878 -0.332202 0.948069 -1.040096 -0.354793 -0.14837 0.067471 0.001385 -0.382305 -0.211089 -0.065123 -1.143245 1.291711 -0.275027 -0.563726 -0.010477 -0.217984 -0.344623 0.07436 0.526375 -0.224473 -0.697426 0.849304 0.507489 -0.480161 0.208189 -0.072697 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.273387 0.147758 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.286459 0.06431 -0.087284 -0.422267 1.124512 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.136352 5.015506 3.67346 4.953255 4.678684 4.109633
"well right now it's 10:50 and i am thinking i'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then i'll get something to eat, i feel very hungry it is probably because i didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway i just remembered i have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time i get home i am going to be so tired that i would just want to go to bed but no i have to cut the grass i guess i should forget about going to the gym today even though i promised myself i will go to the gym every tuesday and thursday. but o well at least i don't have to work today thinking about work i remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun i haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 6 minutes that i have been writing. i wander if i should return my study guide for calculus. i don't know if i need it or not. i am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. i don't know maybe 40 dollars. it makes the job easier but at the same time i have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free i don't even know him. i was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well i probably should give him a gift card of some sort. maybe i'll get one from work like a 30 dollar gift certificate. i feel kind of dizzy. i went to sleep late and then i had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 8:30 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that i had questions about. and now i have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. my eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. i don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun i have had so far today, but still i just can't wait to get out of here. but hey where am i going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no i am hungry i probably should get something to eat i don't know if i should call vivian see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. i could call lisa, i have to call somebody because i hate eating by myself.

"the thoughts that are running through my mind at the moment deal with my studies. i am trying to do as much studying this week before the weekend when all my friends from houston are comming in. i'm having trouble accomplishing this because i haven't managed my time to have enough time to study. i'll go to the library for about 2 hours and feel like i haven't learned anything. aside from school, everything is going well. i have a boyfriend back in houston and we are working the ""long distance relationship"" good. he is visiting me this weekend and so far we have seen one another every weekend. i have been with him for almost two years and ever since i have come to college, i am worried it will not work out. he is 21 years old and doesn't have a successful future as of right now. he is attending a junior college, but he isn't doing much there and he doesn't set goals for himself. i am starting to realize the importance of school and my future. i don't want to waste years of my life with someone that can't provide a future for me. i went potluck this year at my dorm. we get along great. the only flaws i can see as of right now is that she is on the phone all the time and that she sleeps really early. it bothers me that everytime someone calls for mr she tells them shes on the other line and to call back. i cannot do anything past 10:30 in the room for i feel i am interupting her sleep. this is difficult for me because i'm so used to sleeping late and doing little things like playing on the computer or watching television before going to bed. today i only had one class which was economics. i don't think i did very well on our quiz today and i think it will be my hardest class this semester. i am currently in the college of liberal arts as undeclared and i am scared of not being able to get into the business school. i am positive that i want an office job. i am lookin into commuinications as a back up of business. it bothers me how people got into business school just because they were in the top 10% of their senior class, because i went to a ver competitive school with many smart students as where many of the students went to small schools or schools that i know i couldv'e been top ten in. i was happy to be in the top 15% in my school which took a lot of hard work. throughout high school i took an english class at a junior college and i just found out that the official transcript i had sent had no grade on it to tranfer for credit here at ut, so i had to call the college to send another one to ut. my dorm room just got painted and it still smells in here. the people in my wing are friendly. last night i went to an fsa meeting. here i met people the same race as i(filipino). this was interesting to see how many filipinos are on campus and a good way to meet people since i haven't really been associationg with people i've never met yet. i'm looking forward to play co-ed sports with this association and meeting other fsa members from dallas,u of h, and baylor. my older sister was part of this organization and she got a lot out of it. my sister has been an importmant part of my life. she is a motherly figure, but younger. she has been a great role model and is there for me whenever i need her. for the rest of the day i plan on going to the library and studying and going out later on tonight. i'm looking forward to this weekend. i also have to vacuum our room and do laundry. i went to church here in austin for the first time recently and it was very ackward. i have gone to church every sunday in the past with my family and it was weird being there by myself. i started to tear because all these memories of my family and the church arised in my mind. i've realized that recently i have been crying a lot. it's usually emotions built up in my mind of my boyfriend. he has been really nice and caring lately then he was when i was at home. i swam while i was in high school and was going to the gym at least 3 times a week. as i have been in college i have taken fewer trips to the gym. i have been lazy or too busy worrying about school. i have been gettin 5-6 hours of sleep lately. it's not that i stay up late, but its the fact that i am tired and can't fall asleep. i think it is probably caused by stress. i want to go home soon because i need to buy many things for my dorm. it's hard not having a car and being able to go wherever you want when you please. i am eating ramen noodles for the first time as a college student. i ate them at home about twice a week so i'm used to it. the food here at the dorm gets old. i get sick of the same things and same tastes everyday. i think i may be gaining weight. i really need to go running. our televison is finally working and i can watch my soap opera. i really miss my family, dog, and friends back home. in a way i wish i had stayed back.

"as i sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, i feel as if i don't belong here, in this setting. i'm not usually the completely studious type so i'm just trying this library thing out. it's really deathly quiet and i'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me. i feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting. i hope people around me aren't annoyed by this ""tapping"" as i am. i'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least i'm next to the window. i picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored. people watching is fun. it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and i often wonder how different it is from my own. i haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since i've moved up here to austin and just now, i realize that i indeed do miss it. i think i'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on. next time, i should remember to bring a jacket; i feel like i'm turning into a humansicle. but i don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here. it's quite a walk. i really should learn how to use the bus system here. i'm used to having the comfort of my car. the comfort i've had for four years. i miss it. i went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started. it's not because i missed home or i was homesick or anything. i've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much. like this summer, my 5 weeks overseas, i don't think i even thought about my family or home-life all that much. as horrible as that sounds, i'm not the type to miss my family or anything. anyway, i just went home this weekend because i felt that my dorm room was too bland and i wanted to bring up more stuff. i ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that i should have thrown away. instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area. it looks so much better. i also got a new webcam. my mother had one at home that i wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one. my mother's a funny person. she came to the states during her college years about 20-something years ago. i wonder how her college experience was. it must have been hard. i can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying. i've experienced it. still, she managed pretty well, i suspect. she's just that type of person. she has a really strange accent though in her english. normally, asian people have a really ""fobbish"" horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different. it's not a perfect english accent but it sounds slightly european. i don't know why. my mom is a very peculiar person. oh, going back to the webcam thing. i think one day i was using her computer at home and i looked at her picture folder. there were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits. i almost fell out of my chair laughing. my mom is so cute. i believe she chats more than i do online to her friends. we've never chatted before but now that i'm not home, we've started to talk online through msn messenger. it's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but i'm sure i'll be accustomed to it soon. my mom's awesome. i wonder how many of my friend's moms chat online to them. no one. well, no one that i've met anyway. now i've run out of things to say so i'm slowly gazing around this room. i'm next to a beigish wall. i don't think i enjoy the color beige too much. i wish i had better posture. typing on the computer makes me slouch. sitting back while reading makes me slouch. eating makes me slouch. i think i'm just a natural sloucher. i want to grow at least two more inches though. i look taller if i'd stand up straight but it's so hard. i also heard stretching makes you taller. i should try that sometime. i always say i'll start things and never do. or usually i start things that i never finish. i wonder if it's a kind of disorder. there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old. i should go flip through some of them before i leave. they look interesting. i like that old book smell. i don't know why. it'll probably make me sneeze. someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other. i should have smiled or something. i feel so rude and mean. i think i look mean when i feel emotionless or i'm not making any faces on purpose. my mom says asians naturally look angry all the time. maybe it's true. i should smile more often but then i feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself. oh well. it's college now, i'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway. time's up, i'm done.

"i find it hard to write what i am thinking probably because i am always thinking of several things and it is hard to focus on one. but this weekend's events seem to come to mind. i had a really fun weekend. it is not just that i hate school and i needed a break, i honestly don't feel like i am really in college. i just feel like i am going through the motions. it hasn't really set in yet. but right not i am at a friends apartment where a couple of my friends and i have stayed these past couple of nights. a friend is watching office space in the background and i love that movie. it is a great movie and i find it amazing how you can relate much of your life to that movie. i just realized how dramatic i find my life. i make a big deal out of little things. i guess it is my way of dealing with the stress in my life. i make things into a huge deal so it seems too ridiculous to be upset about something that it doesn't bother me anymore. especially when it comes to boys. i find them to be a huge headache. when a relationship doesn't work out i find it easier to be upset and hurt about it and make it not a big deal because once i am finished ranting and raving, it seems kind of silly. besides it is easier to be upset at someone than it is to try and get over those feelings you had for them. but the thing about that is you can't hate them. because in order to hate someone you have to have significantly cared for them at one time or another. the people that hurt you the most are the people that are the closest to you. and i don't want to the people i am mad to know that they have impacted my life to the extent where i am capable of hating them for hurting me. i don't know, it may sound complicated, but it works for me. some people think i am a very complicated person, but i don't think i am. i consider myself to be an honest person and in return i expect your honesty in return. don't bother lying to me. don't waste my time. time is always something that i lack. there aren't enough hours in the day. ever since college i find myself sleeping at doing homework and hanging out at odd hours of the day. just yesterday my friends and i went to 6th street, went to eat and then came back to our friends apartment to swim at 6:00 in the morning. but i guess that is college. i am really looking forward to what the year holds for me. people here in austin are really nice. there are some weirdoes, but overall i like it here. i think i made the right decision about college. life is great. it really is.

"my mom should be here in about 45 min are we going out to eat or will i have to wait till we get home. who will get the front seat in her car? i wonder what will be going on in temple when we get back should i go to the football game or hang out with adam and his friends. it will be our anniversary tomorrow so i should do something with him tomorrow and go to the game tonight. my poor puppy. i really miss him i hope he doesn't shrivel up and die like my mom said sometimes to pets when their owners go away to college. he's been staying under my bed even at dinner. this must be serious. i wonder if adam and i will stay together. i know that every time a big transition in our lives has occurred, like school starting, things have always been kind of weird. now i guess it's just the same thing. we have a lot of fun one day and then the next thing are weird. i guess that it is just us adjusting. i can't believe that lori talked about all of the guys who have stalked her for 25 min this morning in the loudest voice possible. now the whole house knows how desirable she is. this song is annoying but if i get up and change it i won't be able to get back on my writing track. it's over now. she even brought up that guy who threw her in the trash can when she rejected him. she told us that that was back in sixth grade. i guess she is just feeling insecure and needs to tell people that others really do like her. she needs to work on her social skills. i feel sorry for lindsey. she on the other hand seems to be doing great. i guess she bonded with the other girls during the smoke breaks. it kind of sucks that things that i don't want to do , like smoke or drink keeps me from getting closer to the other girls in the house. after all it is only the second week and i'm sure things will change. i haven't really met that many new people that i want to develop friendships with but strangely i don't even care. i like being by myself more than i used to. i guess that is normal, maybe even a defense mechanism. my mom should be here in half an hour now. i don't even really miss anything about home, except for my dog of course, probably because i distanced myself from it enough that i was even disgusted with the town in the last week. that helped. i'm glad that i can analyze my own feelings and realize why i'm having them. it helps sort things out and helps me realize that i am having normal reactions to a big transition. i hope that misty is doing alright. i can't believe that alyson said that about her. she is so inconsiderate and self centered. she wants to hang out on saturday but i really have no desire to see her. she has become somewhat of a slut in my opinion. twenty minutes is up it was nice talking to you mr. computer. you should be a therapist ",1,-1.181952 0.276545 -0.508952 0.647655 0.507457 -0.121159 0.165486 0.504488 0.435057 -0.385967 -0.169208 -0.248869 0.191312 0.605978 -0.533175 0.0 -0.04277 0.37228 -0.783774 1.466832 -0.431937 -0.19289 1.592037 -1.539312 0.012973 -0.140718 0.313876 -0.002239 -0.562323 -0.955095 -0.26687 -0.209998 0.240252 -0.413116 0.32256 -0.218991 -0.589111 -0.780881 -0.215241 0.156373 0.309041 1.536062 -0.904825 -0.106531 -1.048718 0.342699 -0.007999 1.43748 -0.034379 1.561823 0.443006 0.274871 -0.292729 0.340048 2.322188 0.82208 1.071538 -0.20095 0.230587 1.057669 -0.391842 -1.242701 0.052881 -0.745201 -0.064379 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.071028 -0.851622 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.280821 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.197879 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.674475 4.591121 3.804757 4.867282 4.54878 4.797445

"i guess that i should start by telling you where i am. i am in my dorm room at castilian. i only had one class today, calculus. i don't really like calculus that much. but it hasn't been too bad so far. i want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. tonight is their first football game and they are playing the astrodome. i got to play in the astrodome once. it was really cool. at first i was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. but then i realized that i was going to get to play at the ut stadium and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at ut. my roommate is playing a video game now and i'd really rather be doing that. not because i dislike this assignment, but because i haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. school and band are taking up a lot of my time. but i think that is good. i like to stay busy. last year in high school i was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, key club, a little student council, and track. i had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. i would like to have that kind of life here. i think that i would like to join a fraternity, longhorn singers, a bible study group, mock trial, and anything else i can find time for. i like being a part of many different things. that way i can have friends from all over and with many different interests. ut has been very interesting so far. i love the way my schedule works. i am through with my classes today and it is only 12:45 (the day by the way is friday if anybody is actually reading this). i think that i would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. at least then i wouldn't have written it just see how accurately i type. anyways, i'm not sure what i should be writing about. uhhhh. my parents are going to be here tonight. they are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. my mom is really excited. my dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. my mom could careless about the game. all right! only 3 more minutes. uhhh. i have a really nice view of the city from my room. it's on the twentyfirst floor. it really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. and it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. i tried the roof but it was locked. i'm really hungry now and that's good because i only have about thirty more seconds to type. yaady yaady yaady and now i'm done. i am going to go eat. thank you to whoever has read this. and if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that i can do about it.

"i don't really want to do this assignment, i think it's tedious and i want to go to sleep. i haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. i want to study, but i'm totally lost at what i want to do because i have so much work to do. i think i will study psychology first before i study my ee book. i miss my brother, he's so cool. looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. this music in the background is cool, i'm glad i burned the cd today. i hope my dorm mates don't get mad that i'm turning it up so loud. i don't really care that much though. i want to go do something besides work. everyone around here is studying, but i am not. i feel like i'm forgetting to study for something. i wish i went to see that movie last night, it sounded really cool. my neighbors are great, but i don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. i don't understand why i don't trust anyone. i wish i could trust people more, but i think i trust too much already. i don't know. i think i'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. houston seems so far away from here, i miss my family. i don't understand why people don't miss their family here, i seem to be the only one. i try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. i want them to be near me. the houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. the concert i went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. it was strange, off all the concerts i went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. it must be the type of music it is. i wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. but, i hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. i don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. man, my trash can is full, when i'm done i think i'll throw out the trash. why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. i hope that my computer doesn't crash again. it's built well, but i seem to be slacking off on computer studying. i don't know as much as i did or wish to. i love computers so much though. i wish i could be rich like those million or billionaires. but, then again, i don't want to be too greedy, maybe if i could just provide enough for my family. i think i wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what i do. i hope ee is what i like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. i don't think i like writing this. my hands are getting kinda strained. i think i'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, i still have another assignment to do, wow, i'm glad i remembered to do this assignment, i don't want a bad grade only 4 weeks into the school year. okay, i think i want to finish this up. thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, i hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. i think ill stop now. bye.

"at the moment, i am tired. i just woke up a little while ago, and i'm writing. i can't stand writing. i don't mind the work. it's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. i was wondering the other day, if college was reall going to change me into the genius i expect to be. i mean, when i get out into the career world, will i know ""everything"" i need to know about my job? will i have to know everything? will there be room for training and learning? confusion! i guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. i guess what i'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. as i sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, i can't help but realize how much i miss my family back home. although college is my main priority and the fact that i don't care what anyone thinks about me, i can't help but wonder if my family thinks i can make it or not, if i have what it takes. that is always in my mind somewhere. i, myself, know i can make it. i know i have what it takes to succeed. however, when i do graduate and get a career job, is that it? is that going to be my life until i retire. i am very spontaneous and i won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. i stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and i read the assignment again. i have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. i'm not a scientist and i don't care to be. i just want to be happy.

" right, here i am and i have no idea what i'm doing or supposed to be doing. i'm sitting here in a computer lab because my parents thought it would be wise not to bring a computer the first semester. that was a ridiculous thought in my opinion. of course they also thought it would be wise not to go to kansas to see tony this summer only because i'd never driven out of state before. that sucked. and i do feel bad because right after i got up here i went to spend a couple of days with him. i had tons of fun and i really do love him. i don't know what my parents problem with him is. i mean, he's so much like my dad, it's almost scary. maybe they'll warm up to him before too long. we do plan on getting married, not soon of course. heck, it won't even before for like 4 years. i want to wait til after i'm out of college because there's less financial worries. and he's not rich at all. but anywho. i don't know. i still haven't told my parents that i got a speeding ticket on the way home from kansas. how am i supposed to explain that when they don't even know i went to kansas? i paid for the ticket myself, but it's still going to show up on the insurance! and thank goodness, i found out i'm not pregnant. that would be another hard thing to explain. i mean, i love tony and all, but getting pregnant the first time would have totally sucked! plus my dad would have killed us both! anywho, i'm so lazy. i still need to do tons of things. i need to go get my work-study job and a part-time job so i can have money. i still haven't done either. i don't know why, it's not like i haven't had time. the only things i've done, really, is hang out with my cousins every weekend and also go out and do things with my roommate, nubia. she's pretty cool. she's nice, so that's a plus. and we really haven't had any problems. i was a bit worried about that before i moved up here. i was worried she might not be quite as nice or considerate as she really is. in fact, we have a pretty cool arrangement. i can borrow most of her stuff whenever i want and she can borrow most of mine any time. i like that. usually i don't get a long with some people. or rather they don't get a long with me. they say i'm too outspoken or something. i never really know. dang this room is freezing! i wish i had brought a jacket up here with me. i have found that most of the buildings here at ut are kept very cold and i'm not accustomed to that. in fact, i hate it. even bryan and leslie's house is warmer than this. speaking of which, i need to take them out to supper. they are always letting me stay the weekend and taking me places. the only thing i've done for them (other than spending their money) is babysit londyn and laurin once. i want to take them somewhere nice to eat or something. but i don't have a whole lot of money. i also need to see if anganette and jake and leslie want to get together and do something. i had so much fun saturday and ange's house; it was a blast. i never knew croquet could be fun. though, bryan and jake did also make it pretty violent. just imagine contact croquet. yeah, i have a weird family. i hope jessica's doing okay. i know she said she was fine but still. i mean, i know she probably still is pretty upset. but i don't really know what to say to her, so i don't say anything really. i like her, too; she seems really fun to be around and nice (even if she doesn't think people see her that way). i just realized, i need to call windy. i haven't spoken to her since she left for houston, and she's like one of my closest friends. i miss a lot of my friends and family. but i really love it up here in austin. my parents always said i'd get really homesick, but so far i haven't. maybe it's because i do have family up here. i don't know. whatever it is, it's working. shoot! i just missed my calculus discussion group, i think! i'm going to be so dead. but i really don't know where it is either. i showed up tuesday for it, but no one ever showed up. i checked online and it is at 4:30-5:30 and in the room i waited at. maybe they had to do a room change for some reason. i've noticed in some of my other classes that has happened for the discussion meetings. i need to get my readings done for psych. , philosophy, and bio. before i get too behind. i don't want to screw up my chances at getting into the business school and if i don't keep my gpa up, that's exactly what's going to happen. oh, i just remembered, it's only like 19 days until tony comes down to see me. i miss him so much. but i hope he's okay driving that far. he worries me sometimes. but i know he and i will have tons of fun when he gets down here. i want to show him the capitol, the history museum, 6th street, take him on a horse drawn carriage ride (that's so romantic. . ). i don't know what all else there is to do, but we'll think of something. really all we have to do is get on campus and pick a direction and start walking and we'll come to something!

"ok i have been a little nervous about this assignment, not too nervous but a little. i'm kind of a quiet person so writing my thoughts for twenty minutes is a little intimidating. i don't really like how a lot of the stuff we do in psychology is over the internet. i guess it's convenient, but the internet messes up a lot. it is working today though. i just bought tickets for jimmy eat world over the internet. they are one of my favorite bands. my best friend, kristina, is coming up here to go to the concert with me. i miss her a lot! i need to clean my room. courtney, my roommate, has cleaned up a little. i don't think she cares too much that i am messy. she's messy too. she is from my hometown, so i knew her before we lived together here. we are getting really close. i'm glad we decided to live together. i'm glad i didn't wait til the last minute to do this assignment. i need to do my calculus and physics homework too. i also need to, well i don't need to but i want to go get a dvd called waking life. it is really good. it is a movie that makes me think because it questions reality. i like movies like that. i've been thinking about doing stuff with movies as a career, like visual arts type stuff, but that's only if i don't get into the architecture department. i need to take this psychology course because i will need to know how colors affect people's emotions if i am going to major in interior design. that really intrests me. i need to call kristina and tell her that i got the jimmy eat world tickets. she was at my friend jory's house the last time i talked to her. i miss jory a lot too. i haven't seen her in a long time. me and kristina and jory have been friends for a long time, since seventh grade. i miss them a lot. i need to call my friend cherry too. she lives in oklahoma because that's where she is going to college. i have about four minutes left. i hope this is the kind of stuff you wanted us to write. i guess it is because this is what i'm thinking about. i hope it doesn't matter that i didn't capitalize the word i. i never do even when i write unless it is in a paper i need to turn in for english class. my senior english teacher is a really nice lady. i really admire her. she is very encouraging. i miss her too. bye ",1,1.779317 0.731947 0.558006 0.946552 1.397392 0.951584 -0.71768 -0.619892 0.189354 -0.768419 -0.210883 -0.590446 -0.263787 -0.193058 0.130942 0.0 -0.04277 0.947351 0.664114 0.92295 0.949234 -0.408463 0.821107 -1.108615 0.150158 1.158805 -0.431783 -0.306913 0.363325 0.255326 1.431838 0.547529 0.040387 0.292095 -0.610659 1.054814 -0.139596 0.946505 -0.57986 0.919785 -0.21972 -1.713969 -1.359948 -0.321255 -0.503881 0.366818 -1.093488 0.430958 0.349627 0.671386 -0.259253 -1.396551 -0.195307 0.90934 -1.394915 -1.053601 -0.182086 -0.954251 0.678313 -1.106436 -0.372037 -0.73132 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.675191 -0.221637 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.102244 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.761296 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.322718 4.85848 3.914686 4.762404 4.899728 4.894946
"so there you go. my one feeling. tired. i think ill get to know that a little more as the semester goes on. and now i'm beginning to feel another emotion. that of annoyance. my roommate is talking to me about a bunch of crap while i'm trying to do this thing. i've got a dull sort of sensation in my head. i guess i've been working to hard. or maybe that could be from that lack of sleep. but then why do i want to dwell on this the whole time. can i not think of anything better to say?. that brings me to my biggest character flaw. not knowing what to say. and why the hell do i want to bring this up. i don't know. my mind wanders again as he talks somemore. i'm also beginning to feel a little overwhelmed with the college work load. i don't really think it is that much stuff. it's just that i have one class i don't like at all. that being good old rhet'comp. and how can i hate a class like that so much. i hate writing and reading. simply put. i have a strong sensation to end right here with this writing. but then that just wouldn't be right. and then i think i might be able to get something out of this. i kind of feel like i'm doing this incorrectly. seems more like a diary to me. and now the people outside the dorm room are making noise. do they ever have any freaking homework to do. at least i havent heard the bass being played way to damn loud today. the sob was playing the stuff at 2 in the moring. not that it woke me up. but i got to hear my roommate bitch about it. i kind of feel proud of myself somewhat today. i had somewhat of a social interaction with a girl. something that hasnt happened in a while. if ever. yeah. sad state of affairs for me. that brings me back to think of why i havent gone anywhere in my life with the opposite sex. i guess if i just got to being a little more social. yeah. i could fix that problem. well. at least that was a start today. now if i could just keep stuff like that up and not be so much of an introvert. i might just turn out ok. now i'm low in the well of ideas. what else to type about. am i even doing what the assignment was asking of. i remember going to the therapist while i was in middle school. she said i had to express myself. and not be afraid to feel my emotions. yada yada. i know i have emotions to feel. i guess i'm just too damn shy to show them sometime. and now i hear female voices outside. i'm kind of glad i hear them. takes my mind away from doing this. and lets me concentrate on them. i don't know why i like trying to figure out what the hell they are saying. i guess i like seeing how other people interact with one another. speaking of that. me and my roommate. we interact. just don't talk too much. we need to get the hell out of this room a little more often and meet different people. i can't force him to do anything . but i know i can maybe get myself out to do some stuff. i'm kind of pissed at the people from school that came to ut. it's almost as if they fucking ignore me. but then thats ok. i know some might be doing that just because i am with my roommate. they don't really like him much at all. i just got a little laugh hearing my roommate having computer problems. i'm really having a bad time when i have to talk about something like that. well. i'm kind of proud of myself. i was able to spend 16 minutes so far talking about almost absolutely nothing. one last thing to talk'bitch about. i like the food here at dobie. yeah. nice to know. but the fucking lines are a bitch. 2 mins remaing. go clock, go. wooh. i used a comman. i better learn to have more patcients (spelling) with the hw assignments. i always find myself watching the clock, seeing how many pages i have left, or anything else that i can use to see what kind of a pace i am on. and once i find out how slow it's going for me. i get discouraged. oh well. the clock on the computer reads 10:50. that would make 20 mins complete. 1'2 way done. lets get this over with ",0,0.442387 -0.703911 0.48854 -0.820965 -0.335241 0.04793 -0.543065 -0.207964 -0.756807 0.564483 -0.251769 -0.445535 -1.100242 0.314254 -0.787113 0.0 -0.04277 -0.343441 0.46217 -0.010177 0.484884 -0.551623 -0.567831 -0.586328 1.587304 0.527783 1.22924 0.286334 0.72078 -0.284653 -0.521649 -0.583255 1.248559 0.120622 1.774108 0.436018 -0.17092 -0.102196 0.186909 -0.77281 -0.570865 0.728394 -1.259487 2.240296 0.421209 2.384206 1.167396 -0.162677 2.603894 -0.831156 -0.10424 -0.359138 -0.259338 -0.229502 -0.129505 0.142947 -0.127215 -0.431252 -0.356114 0.301418 0.030537 -0.111192 0.630072 0.265091 3.807602 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.794437 -1.186511 0.046279 -0.23436 -0.380794 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.009781 0.298272 0.477295 0.452317 4.590217 3.652224 4.212822 4.590121 4.773159
"i hope i can make it to my next class on time. the pop up ads on my computer are getting very annoying. my throat hurts. i have to take a pill i got from health services. a little cold in here. it just got a lot darker. i have to turn in a maintenance slip so they'll change my light bulbs. meningococcal vaccine today after chemistry. i shouldn't crack my knuckles. i wonder how my roommate can study so much. what does he have so much work in? i miss andi. she is in new york right now with football players and lacrosse players all over her. it makes me angry. i hate being jealous, but i can't help it. no one else is online. i hope andi will visit soon. i bet i'll go into a trance if i stare at this screen long enough. i won't fall asleep, i'll just kind of zone out. it got darker again. why don't i notice when it gets light? i have to call leslie from a chi o and make sure she brings all the girls to our mixer tonight. i have to get to the gym. out of shape. only 6 minutes? wow. i'd better think more. i feel like a monk. i must block outside distractions and focus my energy inside. darker again. there are monks in tibet that can raise their body temperature by ten degrees or so just by meditating. the power of the mind! i have beach boys stuck in my head for some reason now. god that's irritating. why is my back so stiff? i need to get more sleep. mondays and wednesdays suck, because i have to get up early. no tv and no beer make homer something something. the simpsons is a great show. it's slacked a little recently, but its still good. there, it got brighter. but slowly. i'm cold. i haven't had a single test yet. i wonder how hard they will be. economics is so boring. stream of consciousness. i should shave now. no time. i can't shave for two months! damn fraternity. how can i type continuously if i'm not thinking anything? i think too much usually, but now, nothing. i overanalyze things. or at least that's what my ex girlfriend told me. i think that i was just thorough. oh well. it's just like, paranoia is just a heightened sense of awareness. that was in a movie, conspiracy theory, with mel gibson. i never saw it. mel gibson was on the simpsons once. apparently his family is very anti-semitic. i wonder what andi is doing. hey, doesn't the average guy in america think about sex once every 6 seconds or something? every other line i should write, sex. "" or just something gross and raunchy. oh well. sex. ha. i think girls are worse than guys, but no one knows it. i think if we put a microphone in a guys room and in a girls room, you'd be blown away buy what the girls say. crazy. sex. i hope i can see andi soon. she is busy with tennis. i want her to come. ok, i'm done. sex! haha ",1,1.126276 1.206552 -1.276096 1.2053 1.067198 -1.114176 -0.272554 -0.355505 -0.517958 -0.454127 -0.272189 0.499139 1.603636 -0.858697 -0.408316 0.0 -0.04277 0.026004 -5e-06 -0.211494 -0.056959 -0.45867 -0.251541 0.646491 0.033746 -0.039319 -1.106534 0.17739 -0.069671 -0.720653 -1.100231 0.670285 0.702634 -0.397043 1.404446 -0.189959 -0.204515 0.193544 0.224943 -0.065267 -0.342868 0.904648 -0.268048 -0.653842 0.143406 -0.569237 -0.346231 -0.574919 -1.028403 -0.608552 1.117497 0.002677 -0.484765 0.361339 -0.662015 -0.590219 -0.144095 -0.954251 -0.832578 -0.562579 -0.874219 -0.492868 0.620686 1.759176 0.449541 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.991802 -0.040371 -0.073676 -0.23436 1.418168 0.315708 -0.074613 0.004432 0.394987 -0.451544 -0.408772 1.459367 4.584826 4.214321 4.480383 4.780361 4.950263
"9'8'97 yeah, i've finally gotten around to doing this assignment. i hope i do o. k. oh whoops, i forgot to check my watch to see when i need to stop. o. k. it's 1:50 so i will stop at 2:10. i just double spaced at the end of that period. i remember learning how to do that in my 8th grade computer class. oh gosh, what if this is too short? i'm a really slow typer, but this is really fun. the girl next to me is typing so fast, maybe i will be that good by the end of this year. there is a boy now walking around with a blank expression on his face. i wonder where he is going. after this i am going to my room and working on some homework. i like how the keys on this computer feel when i type. i miss my computer at my house, but anyway. this is fun, because i'm so used to typing in an organized fashion where everything is structured. i mean this assignment is structured, but our writing doesn't have to be. my left eye itches, but i'm afraid you touch it because i don't want to waste any time on my assignment. my watch just beeped which means that it is now 2:00, and i have ten minutes left. wow, a loud buzzer just went off, maybe someone messed up a computer or something. someone just rattled his change which reminds me that i have only a little bit of money left for the week. i hope i'm writing enough. this is as fast as i can go. i wonder if you really read these or just skim through them. it said this was a completion grade, good. i'll work on the other assignment tomorrow afternoon. the line now for waiting has gotten really long. thank goodness it is air-conditioned in here. my left eye still hurts and is making me blink. i wonder what the others in here are working on? i wonder what my parents are doing right now? they are probably both already at home. i hope they find a place to stay for parents weekend. gosh, that sounds so freshman. i only have 5 more minutes left. there is no way the teacher reads all of these. the t. a. must help. i like scott. i went to one of his study sessions. my nails are long and i wanted to get a manicure. i wonder how many in the class have finished this assignment? typing is very therapeutic, i feel a lot more relaxed now. i hope i've typed enough. the girl next to me is leaving. i have 2 minutes left. i just checked my watch. i'm kind of sleepy. i think i will go to bed early tonight. yeah, tonight david letterman is on. he's my favorite. oh, my time is up. i'll be back tomorrow to work on the next homework!!!

"i have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. i am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. it was full though, so i signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled ""introducion to italian culture,"" but i dropped it this morning, because i think it is so irrelevant to anything i am interested in, and i am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. i was signed up to take 15 hours, but since i droppped that seminar, i now have only 12 hours. anyway, i am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is ""interior design. "" i'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but i just thought that is worth a shot. i am sitting in my dorm, hardin house, right now, and i just figured out how to use their computers here. i did not bring my own computer, so i am having to use the computers here. i still do not know how to check my email yet, though. i just figured out how to be able and send email from here. my roommate does have a computer, but i can tell that she would prefer it if i didn't use her's, so i respect that. she has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. we knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. i was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but i think taht it will work out fine. one of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. she is the one who i am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. she got into that class. anyway, in the dorm that i am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. stacy, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. the part that i live in is bigger, but i kind of wish that i lived in the other part. the people that i live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. oh well, i'm over across the street a lot, so i guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. i am so excited that r. u. f. is starting tonight. it is a bible study that i am going to go to. i've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. i miss all of the christian based things that i went to bakc at home. i used to go to campus life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. i also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. she is not much older than i am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that i go through. not taht i have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. speaking of problems, i did get really homesick the other day. obviously, i guess you can tell that i am a freshman. anyway, i got sick , adn any time i am sick i always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. but, i managed just fine. i went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and i am feeling much better today. i still am really tired though. i think that might have been why i got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. well, i have finished the twenty minutes, but i'm sure taht this is horribly written, but i guess it doesn;'t matter.

"today was a very long and exhausting day. i began by waking up at 8:15, after only 6 hours of sleep, to go to a 9:00 art history discussion lab at the museum. it actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep, that way i wouldn't be as tired as i am right now. but instead i decided to go ahead and go to class, otherwise i would just fall behind and not know what happend. personaly, i am not one to really like getting behind, so i think that i made the right decision, granted i may be tired right now, i know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run. as my day continued, i went to the actual class lecture for art history. it was somewhat interesting, although i found it a little difficult to consentrate. i guess that may be because i did not catch up on my reading that i was supposed to have completed by today. obviously i am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities. futhur in the day, i went to the dentist to get a filling, which was not fun! the right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours. that may not sound like too long, but in reality, when your mouth is numb and you can't talk well, and you can't eat or drink anything because you will spill it, it is a long time. then i proceeded to go to a meeting. i had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while i was gone. this kind of bothered me just because i payed for this computer and i could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers. i just don't really think that that is fair. then what really irritated me, which doesn't happen too ofter, is that when i came back from the meeting, the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor. my brand new shirts that are not even two days old, my purse, and my shorts, were all on the ground. now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it, but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it's place is rude. i was quite mad, so instead of confronting her, i just left and went to get tcby and to watch tv with my sister. i guess you could say that i did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off. oh well, what's done is done, but next time i think that i just might have to say something to her(if i let her use my computer next time). well, that was pretty much my day, and now i am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework, which is making me stressful. i know that i will be relieved when i finish it all, though.

"okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. i have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. but i am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but i am getting the hang of college life. most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. i want to stay, besides i went to dallas last weekend for labor day for my sister's birthday. i got to see my best friend zach who is now in colorado trying to wrestle. but i am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since i will there the first weekend of october for txou and the santana concert. then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. my oldest sister maggie is bringing her new fiance. i haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. they both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a catholic church. catholicism is kind of funny that way i come from a very strong catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the university of dallas which is catholic and not liberal ut. however, my parents strategically placed my in dobie, next to the university catholic center. smart people. little do they know the last time i went to church was when i was in dallas. my dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what i have wanted to do for the majority of my life. but last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now i am in dean speck's architecture class which is fascinating i love it. who knows when i'll figure out what i want to do, i do have the feeling that no matter what i decide to do that i'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. but that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. my sister jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her lsat and apply to law school. she is even applying to ut law that would be cool if she was down here too. i like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. it's not that she places that responsibility on me but i am the closest to her out of my family so i am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. yeah, she's applying to law school. at least she has some sort of direction. it's hard for her to hear the truth. but i slammed it down her throat this summer and i think it hit her. i wonder when kim is getting home. i think she said 5:00. i like having the whole suite to myself though i can actually get some stuff done. we have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with reese. reese is probably lonely without jessica around to bug her. i hope i get her as my diamond sister, that would be really cool. kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see dave matthews band one of my favorites. i have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so i don't think i am going to go. unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. i'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. i miss my dog. it took me 17 years to get a dog and i finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and i leave for school. i'll probably breed labs when i'm older i love labs and i don't see why i'd ever have any other kind of dog. my suitemates are really organized i am typing on amy's computer and i'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, i'm done!

" let's see. i love him? maybe. he told me he loved me, well, that he liked falling in love with me. wow. this is new. i love being held by him. i miss him when i'm not with him. i think about him when we're not together. i don't know what to tell him. nothing needs to be said though. we like each other. love may come, develop, whatever. it's a good feeling to know that you are loved, not having family and old friends nearby. he makes me feel like i am at home. now that i do have a new home, up in oklahoma. speaking of which, he said he wanted to come with me when i go up. wonder what the parents will say??? oh well, nich likes him and i know they will too. he's hard not to like. so busy, not enough time. should i stay home this weekend to spend more time with him or is that trying too hard? what's trying to hard though, if my feelings are this strong then it shouldn't matter whether or not i try to be with him. obviously he has the same feelings, he only called me every day like five times in the past couple days since he has been busy with his fraternity business. ahh, the good old fraternities. i wish i would have rushed, but then again i am glad i didn't. there is always next year. wonder if it is more difficult to get in as a sophomore?? we shall see. i mean, i don't think greek life is that important. but aparently to some it is. i guess i need to make more friends that are girls. i really do want to become more involved as well. it's just the whole rushing process that i wouldn't like. the getting all dressed up and basically trying to impress some girls. not to mention the fact it seems like competition. one of my not-so-favorite things. i don't really understand it all. i just couldn't be fake like i know some girls are. why bother? i mean, be who you are if they don't like that, then what on earth are you doing? there's no reason for them not to like me. i can't decide whether it's an acceptance thing or not. i don't think i am scared of being rejected. sure in a sense i am. but i think i would take it better if others didn't have to know. i like the perks with a sorority, they seem fun. a lot of time commitment though. i guess i just think that i would see him more often if i were in a sorority, if not that, then i would be just as busy as he is. i mean, i have lots to do now, probably should be doing even more. but still. it's different. poor erik, i wonder if he is still bitter towards his parents about not letting him pledge. it suprised me when my mom said they would pay for it. does she realize the cost? i know she really wants me to get involved as well though. well, i guess i can just ask casey and lauren and other girls how it is. that is if they can say. blah blah blah. nothing on my mind. oh i wonder if lk got the tickets to the live concert. i want to go. but it's such a hassle to drive to katy and back. plus i would probably miss a few classes. let's see, that friday is my homecoming. haha. won't that be great. very unusual for sure, but it will be fun to see everyone. i wonder if they have changed. i know i have. i mean, i haven't seen these people since may. coming here over the summer was one of the most life-changing experiences. strange enough to say, it is very true. i met so many good friends. i met my baby, who. i love. . yeah about that. we've been together for sometime now and he is seeming to settle more or less. which i might add, i thought could never happen. ok, but hold on, we're like 18, no settling allowed. yeah he asked if i would marry him. that was funny, jokingly, luckily. haha. no, funny thought to think about though. marriage. ahh. i really can't wait, no can wait, but i look forward (much better wording) to having a family. i want a happy family and a loving father' husband. wow, i wonder what guys think about this stuff. i never used to even care about family and husband and future stuff. but since he came along and we've been together. it just makes ya think. good thoughts, nothing too serious. man i love him though. i hope he knows.

"here it goes. 20 minutes seems like a long time but i don't have to think really. wait, that is the whole purpose. think, think, think. the game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but i would never say anything. just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. well, i see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. hopefully i can get her a ticket to the game. maybe i will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that i will buy a ticket for, lets say, $10. i think that should work. ever since i came here i have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. it always comes off. it really annoyed me, i mean really annoying. so, when i went home this weekend i bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. i have installed them and could not be more pleased. i have beat the mattress! victory is mine! its interesting that i can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. pretty decent view. tonight, i worry that i am too behind in my classes. yet, i can't imagine that everyone in the class is. i mean, i do a pretty decent amount of work. i bet i am about equal with most students. the part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make cs in there class. that is just not acceptable. i have to go graduate school. how hard is it to go to graduate school? i really don't know. i can't be that hard. or is it? 11 more minutes what to talk about. my suitemate just started the shower. i can hear the water running. i also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. pow, pow, pow. that must be fun. i, however, am trapped in this writing screen. write, write, write. like a machine. now i hear jazz music. i've never really met anyone who like jazz music. this kind of reminds me of catcher in the rye. maybe holden caulfield was just a steam of consciousness. i wish i had a hunters cap to put on. maybe i could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. where do they go in the winter, anyway? does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. or do they just fly away, fly away. ah! i've received an instant message. i can't read it yet. must type, type, type. 6 minutes left, almost there. nope, that is still a long time. i just noticed my rubik's cube. one side is completed, the others? you guessed it, incomplete. maybe one day i will finish it. ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 4 and a half minutes left. just keep typing. my neck hurts too. this is making me sleepy. i really want to go to sleep after this. ah, that would be nice. but no, i have to read. lots of reading actually. in fact, psychology, 1 chapter. pow, pow, pow. he says, missed the head.

"well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, i finally found one. unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. i can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!) i am smiling now. i always find irony amusing. they are still pounding next door. what the hell are they doing. he heheeheh-they just called us the 'fort worth girls' now that's funny stuff. i seriously have a major stomach ache. it hurts soo soo soo bad. i have been sick for like, three or four days now, i really feel terrible. my insides just hurt and every time i stand up i get dizzy. this computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. oh well i only have 13 minutes left if i did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, i probably did not do. i kind of feel bad that these people i don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. that's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it? everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. i wish my computer was working. it's really, really cute. it's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. i wonder how i did on my french test two days ago. i hope that i did okay. i am seeing all kinds of new people. isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you don't know and will never meet? i think that that is , well to say the least, strange. my back really hurts. i think , wow, coughing fit, that i will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. i feel so bad now, physically and mentally. i cant wait to go home this weekend. have my mom take care of me and see my guy that i am kind of dating. i miss him. he says he misses me. i wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. i said that i loved him but i don't know if i really meant it. i don't know if i could ever really love anyone. after all, i really don't even think that i love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. anyway, he has a boxer dog named romeo. very cute. i hate most dogs however. i love my cats. i miss my cats. i am glad i am getting at least this first assignment done. i cant spell for shit tonight. i also manage to talk like a sailor. oh well. i feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until i leave, i guess i wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. i wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when i leave. that must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, i guess i'll just be as nice as i can be. i really don't want her to hate me but oh well. oh hello boy in very very short shorts. that is so montreal. i am just in extreme pain. i want to work out and i haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. hello freshman 15, 25, 55. i'm all about gaining weight this year. my mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. maybe i just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. i want to go to france. i wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. i really must be very very thankful. i am such a terrible person. i really really am mean.

" currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. today is my 9 month anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. she is the best thing that ever happened to my life. i want to by her a ring and i have been giving it plenty of thought. i have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. i thought about my grandmother, who is affected my alzheimer's. i felt gult come over me when i thought of all the times i yelled at her. i live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. i generally understand that i am not truely mad at my grandmother when i yell at her. i am mad at the disease. i don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. i got addmitted to the business school thats the reason i am here. and i have been thinking that i have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that i am living. i worked harder than most and i played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my senior class. but again i feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. what should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words i could say, i'm in the business school. people look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which i can officailly say bothers me. i love my mom. . she called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. she is so worried about me. oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind i have. my roomie says that i complain alot. . do i. my girlfriend has said the same but i disagree with them both. i just want to be the best at everything and i have to win or im not happy. just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. god made me competitive and thats the way i live. back to that business thing. . i worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. see my parents had a divorce my junior year of high school. thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. my dad left us and i can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. besides that i'm in love and i have the best girl i could ever dream of. her mom says we can't be together but all through our senior year we stayed together. sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. not loyalty and all the universal answers to what makes a best friend. she sacraficed her family to be with me. her mom said, either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him. she chose me in an instant. . for a long time i woundered why. . and to this day the only answer i could find is love. true love is what we share and today is 9 months. love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. my grandfather had to raise me since i never had a father. that hurts me more than the world could ever know. oh another thought came to me. i am suffering from sexual frustration. i'm not sure if i can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right? well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1'2. seems like forever but we will be fine. we pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. i nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. if i complain too much sorry. thats just me right?

"i'm mad because i had just typed for twenty minutes and now i have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. ahhhhhh, i'm mad. anyways today i turned 18. i'm so happy. now i'm just going to write about anything because i'm hungry and tired. today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. i'm mad. tomorrow i'm going to san antonio and i hope me three friends from dallas can come visit me. it'll be all of them, johnny, cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. lauren's letter made me cry. it was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. it was sweet too. jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and i thought he hated me since i'm with johnny and all. that was sweet of him, but i wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. he used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. my other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. anyways, being 18 will be cool. i finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. i also get to get my own bank account, either wells fargo or the university federal credit union. i also get to go get my driver's license, because i never went to driver's education. yeah! okay, i'm a little happy now. johnny is a good boyfriend though. he really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. like he rather be with me than his friends. that's cool sometimes, but i saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. he hasn't called me yet. oh oh i'm sad again. i miss him, and i'm glad i get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. i still have homework or should i say dormwork to do. hahahaha! okay that was corny, but i'm still cool. oh yeah i'm going to a party at around 9:30. oh oh i guess i'll have to call johnny by then if he doesn't call me. he said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. i know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. well it's still light outside, so i guess that's okay. two more minutes and i hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. well today was a great day and i feel like doey howser typing away at my computer. that was dumb but i'm mad so i guess that's okay. well times up, bye.

"music is great. someday by nickelback has got to be one of the best songs i've heard in long time. nothings wrong. just as long as you know someday. "" ahhh well, good message behind it i guess. every time i look in your eyes i simply fall into your lies. it's fun to try to make up new lyrics to songs. helps the creative process i get. i just ate some flavored ice and it tastes pretty good. although the grape had a strange aftertaste. nothing else could affect me like this. just your eyes and your deadly kiss. words just keep popping into my head. i've been listening to this song over and over. its actually on repeat. my plug only has one socket. i was surprised when i first saw that. most have two. oh well. finally, you've returned my mind to me. but still you've left me nothing. so it's only been 5 minutes and i've written quite a bit. this is slow going. i guess water really doesn't boil if you watch it. people don't seem to call me much anymore. i guess it might be because i end up calling them but still. i don't know, it's weird i guess. this is a lot like writing a journal. free consciousness. i loved catcher in the rye. strange book though. i didn't like the other big stream of consciousness book. i forgot what it was called. all i see are visions of your face reminding me all of this was a waste. hmmmm. my time thing doesn't show me how long i have left. i guess i started at 9:40 so i have 10 minutes left. ""why weren't we able. "" nickelback really has some great songs. no one, leader of men. all seem fairly angry however. perhaps that is why i liked them. subconscious anger perhaps? all you left were remnants of pain tell me what you thought you'd gain. my nose hurts. i should put my ring on. for some reason i always forget to put my ring on before going to class. i dropped my 427 calc class today and opted for 408d instead. i thought perhaps learning second semester was more important than skipping to a higher level of math. it's all about the basics, isn't it? the only bad thing about this was that i also had to drop my philosophy class as well. so i'm down to 13 credit hours. this means i have to find something else to do. even though i'm working, i kinda feel like i'm being lazy if i don't go back up to at least 15 credit hours. i'm only 1 credit hour above the requirement for a full-time student. perhaps i'll take tae kwon do or guitar. i think the tae kwon do is only 1 credit hour tho, while guitar is 2. i hope i'll still be able to start. that'd be pretty fun. the only thing is i don't really know what kind of exams i would get through those classes. perhaps i'll talk to the music department tomorrow. i have to wake up at 7 tomorrow. i don't really feel like going to class at 8 in the morning. and my calc class still has it's discussions at the same time as before. so i still won't get a break until 4:30 tomorrow. man, it's going to be a very long day. perhaps it won't be too bad though. maybe i'll be able to figure out some way to pass the time. this has got to be more than 100 words. all i see right now is the finish button. it's calling me. slowly, slowly. ""instead of a hollywood horror. "" i also see the logitech sign for my mouse. it's a really good mouse. nice and cordless, as well as wireless. "". i know you're wondering when. "" so why do human beings miss such obvious signs pointing out problems? do we really miss them or are we just blinding ourselves to them. perhaps those are the same things. all you gave me were endless problems. now show me how to solve them. i really like using the . , ellipses? something like that. i always got it messed up. i probably overuse them. they're nice though. they show a pause much more clearly than a comma (in my mind at least). also, they're useful in showing sarcasm. much sarcasm. "". now the story's played out like this. "" ""nothing's wrong. "" those just seem to stick in my head. i don't know for sure why. perhaps i see my own relationships in those. i think it's almost been 20 minutes. i guess i should probably write for a little bit more just to make sure its been a full 20 minutes.

" hello. i'm not quite sure what to think about this. i love to write, but i write in such a way that i can always go back and correct it. it's almost like i find myself having to check everything i do a million times because i never like it the first time. so to sit here and write for 20 minutes, knowing that it has to be continuously. . that's almost too much. and another thing. i don't really like not having a topic. i find it's not kind organized, and i'm not sure where to take the topic. maybe i'm afraid of what i'll say the first time around, which could be interpretted to me that i'm afraid of my true feelings, but i think when i type that, everyone will think i'm only saying that because this is psychology. that's not true. i supress everything. everything. i don't think anyone knows the real me, because i've never really let anyone in. i would love to, however. if i ever felt like they truly wanted to be let in, but as it stands, none of it matters. man, i am sounding like a real nut. this is not cool. i am crazy, i think. and now, my mind is thinking about the cowboys game i was watching before this. it was in the 4th and it was going nothing but downhill for 'em. i like the cowboys a lot, and i hope they win, but school is important, and besides, i couldn't watch them lose like that anymore. boo to football. boo to losing. it all sucks. and now, with that wonderful segway, i guess i could talk about other things. things not so trivial. man, 20 minutes is a long time. i wonder if any of this will make sense, if it can even be read on a scale or whatever it will do when i click finish. man, i wish i could click finish right now. no such luck. no such luck. no such thing. isn't that the name of the song that john mayer sings? he sucks because he's going out with jennifer love hewitt. i like jennifer love hewitt a lot and i like typing her name because it's so long that it passes the time. jennifer love hewitt. jennifer love hewitt. . and that makes me out to be a freak too. . how many times can i type her name. isn't that a waste of time. isn't cheating? why am i talking this way? you know, i want to get a poster of jennifer love hewitt for my bathroom. i've never really put up posters. but now that i have my own apartment bedroom, i think i should. it's a good expression of me, but i wonder what everyone who enters my bathroom will think. will they think i'm this big horny toad who likes having her in my bathroom? well, not having her, but you know. speaking of which, i need a girlfriend! my shower curtain is so clear, and the mirror is right across the bathroom. it's kind of weird washing my hair to look over and see myself. washing my hair. imagine the possibilities. now, if i had that poster of jennifer love hewitt, i could look out and stare at her. only, it wouldn't really be her. i don't know what i'm talking about. i bet if i start talking about girls i actually know, when i click finish, i'll find out a lot of stuff. which brings me to this girl i like. i don't understand how i can have so much with her. no, wait. i take that back. what i really don't understand is how a girl can have so much fun with me, and be so comfortable around me, and still not want to go out. i feel like the girl of the friendship. i want the serious relationship, and she doesn't want to be tied down. what is tied down? why look at something so negatively. i mean, if you're happy with someone, why should you obsess over what might tempt you in the future. planning out your future is one thing, but planning to stray or be attracted to someone else is quite another. i've been told i'm too young to love right now anyway, and i should wait, but i don't think anything changes. i mean, i know myself too well. and i know that i would be so happy to be in a relationship that everything else would subside; it wouldn't matter. happiness isn't easy to come by, and i would hold on to it like nothing i've ever held on to before. so, yeah, i just. i'm just so confused about everything. i've never been in a serious relationship, and i've been told that's why i want one so much. i don't know. it's kind of like. of course it's what i want. we want what we can't have. that makes me feel even worse, but old sayings like that are around for a reason. i just. wish i had something to offer that could win her over. something, besides everything else i offer to her, to make her see that it's all worth it. that she shouldn't worry about the future, because i will take care of everything. of course, thinking about it like that, i have to totally become unbiased: if she is not wanting to go out with me, because she doesn't want to be tied down, then she is planning on going out with several guys in the meantime. i guess you could say that means i'm saving myself a lot of heartache, but it also means that even though she's planning this multitude of guys over the next few years, she still won't choose me. i'm still just a friend. i know guys hate that. i used to tell my friends that were in the same situation that being friends was great. you still have the girl as a friend. so what if you can't go out? you can still hang out, and you can still talk. well, then i actually found myself in their shoes, and i understand. it's so much clearer. from the outside, it looks good. when you get there, not only does it feel gut-wrenching, it also feels like everyone on the outside is laughing at you, like they can't understand any of it. and i don't understand that, but it's like, you're screwed even though you know better. i knew better. i know i lose a friendship that is extremely important. and maybe it's a risk that i shouldn't take. i say that because i can't take it; otherwise, i would have already, and i would probably be somewhere crying right now. not that i cry. not that that's bad. i just. always find a way to hide my emotion, which may be part of my problem. i'm not crazy. i just. i'm a big fan of fate. i think what's meant to be is exactly that, so if this girl and i are meant to be then we will be. and if not, i'll just sit around and wonder why. 5 seconds. by the way, john mayer is a cool singer. just sucks he's going out with jennifer love hewitt! the end. i went over. wow that was fast. bye.

"my main thoughts right now consist of music. i am thinking of a new song that i wrote about my thoughts on the people that i have seen at ut. music i feel is the greatest thing in the world because i get to release all my emotions through a song. i think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. these reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. i don't believe any of them write their own songs, so i can't see why people would think they are talented. this brings me to something else i do not like about people, they are generally fake. what i mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. for example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. this things i do not do and hopefully never will. i feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. i thought by coming to ut that i would see less of this type of attitude from people but i now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. from this point i would like to say that ut is great(except for parking)and that i do like more people here then i did in high school. i am not sure what i want to do with the education i am receiving from this school but i hope that very soon i will recognize my calling in life.

" today has been such a long day. i am not a big fan of tuesdays. physics makes me feel so stupid. i feel like everybody else knows exactly what he is talking about in that class except for me. this is kind of weird writing to a computer about my thoughts, kind of like an online journal. i really need to start writing in my actual journal every night. i did last year, but ever since i got here, i just haven't made the time everynight. kristen and i have been getting along great. i think we are going to be great roomates. i've been thinking a lot about me and patrick a lot lately. i'm not sure if i can handle another 2 years of him living in dallas and me in austin. i know we've done it since march, but i think it is getting harder. i wish i knew how to type. i think my entry is going to be 1'3 the length of kristen's, but i guess it doesn't really matter. man i've got so much to do tonight. i need to read for psychology, interior, art history, and figure out my physics homework before thursday. my mom and i have been getting along really well lately. i think we are going to be much better friends now that we don't live under the same roof. i'm not sure when i'm going to be able to go see my grandparents. gosh, i haven't seen them in forever. maybe i should go somewhere to study tonight instead of trying to study in my room. i never feel like i accomplish very much in here. what really stinks is i can't read my art history anywhere else but in the room. those stupid reserves just won't print out right. i guess i could try that adobe business that girl was talking about during class. i'm not sure if i'll have to buy that or iff my dad could just put it on my computer off what we have at home. i can't wait to watch friends later. it's been fun lately because they've been playing a season that i've never seen. it's always the small things that make me the happiest. oh no, the phone is ringing. i guess the will just have to wait for 3 more minutes. it was probably kristen at the grocery store. i'll just call her back in a second. i'm glad tommorrow isn't as jam packed as tuesdays. i couldn't take two in a row. now my cell phone is ringing, what's up?

" well it is about 1:20 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. i keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. i guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. i almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying hey you should be studying something! ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. the joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a b or c on a test rather than an a . i like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. so because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. right now my grades are very important to me. i feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. my success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. you must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. so in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in business. my happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 15 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. it makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. ha. . what a character. well no not really just a determined man. i like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. when i moved here from colorado i had an agenda and for the last 3 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. it gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. i see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. man i need to get some sleep. i took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the t . many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9'11. wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. the doctors say that she does not feel a thing. i really would like to believe them. it seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. the doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. i miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? it seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. i have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. maybe that is part of this writing experiment. have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. so when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. the mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. i read somewheres that in a thousand years the english language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. so they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the egyptians. . times up. . night.

"well, i have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so i guess i should start working on it now. it's a thursday afternoon and all i'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. what a life! these stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. let's see, i've been up here for about a month now, and i have yet been able to see and fun"" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. it's not that i want to be partying everyday, still i would like to see what's all the fuss's about. then again, my life here at the apartment is great. i live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them i would be bored out of my mind. these restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. i'm hungry, yet i don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? of course not! it's because i have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. during the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to ut, so during the day they're at the campus. maybe i should spend more time at the campus. maybe that would help me get to know more people. i haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that i see in class everyday, those that i greet with a casual hello; however, i don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. my computer desk keeps on shaking while i'm typing this, i should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? this place is so cramped. luckily, this weekend i'm going back home to houston to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. i miss my family very much, especially my dad. he have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. now, i have to be on my own, that's the only way that i will learn to grow up. i know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what i'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how i'm doing in school, wondering how late i sleep, wondering how many times i eat in a day, etc. i know he worries, but the best i can do is call him every night just to let him know that i'm doing fine. i can't go back home, if i live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then i will never learn to grow up. i miss my mom too, but i'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. the buses hear run pretty frequently, i just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. my roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. i'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. my other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. it's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. oh yea, vsa meeting is today, maybe i will get to know more people. then again, i doubt it because i'm always quiet and reserved so i guess i won't talk much. well, i'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. after this, i'm going to head to class, then it's vsa meeting.

"i feel good about hanging out with different people throughout the day. i find that it gets so monotonous when i see the same person day in and day out. i don't like feeling trapped in a relationship, so i guess i am very wary of commitment, although i wouldn't mind starting a relationship with someone. i miss the physical contact of a relationship. maybe i haven't been getting enough hugs lately. i haven't had one for about a week now. it does make a difference. you have to fend for yourself here at ut. no one is going to be your babysitter, and sometimes that's hard for me to accept. i have to take care of my own health, academic career, make my own friends and spend time with them, and also join organizations that i deem worthwhile. it seems like a lot of responsibility, but i am gradually learning how to handle it. i have never realized before how incredibly independent i am. i am in fact, lonely a lot more than i thought i was. at home i didn't feel it as much because i lived with four other people. but now, i notice that i get timid when i am alone. i didn't have a roommate for 2 weeks, and i thought i would like it because i would get privacy and free reign over the room. but i didn't realize how anxious being alone made me. i started eating a lot to fill the void. i never could figure out why i binged so much before, especially during high school. but now i think that i felt alone, and i was ashamed to ask someone to be my company. so i would eat to fill the lonely space and cover the shame. that's weird how i wanted to be even more alone when i felt isolated. now i want to get involved with people as much as possible since i have recognized the problem. liz and i will try to hang out more now, at least once a week. i want to have my meals with at least one other person. it sucks to be alone, but at least i know that now. i have ten minutes to write. working out sure refreshes you and makes you feel more alive, but it sure does make you tired. it's also my blood sugarit's a tad low now and i will be eating something for lunch soon. i don't want to eat alone! maybe brooke will eat w'me. i wonder what jason's up to now. he had an 8:00 class this morningi think? we spent some time with each other this weekend, which was a lot of fun. i like being around him because he is so patient and has some good things to say. he's also very open about himself, which is a new thing for me. i don't know if i would want to start something with him. it would be a fun thing and add some ""extra"" to the relationship, but sometimes it makes things weird and i would not want to lose his friendship. i will just keep on doing my thing, and improving myself and if it happens, it happens. i just want to be able to spend some time with him! i know i will though. there is that navigator lake house bash this weekend that he told me about, and i think i should go. i don't want to know what i look like in my bathing suit right now. hard workouts this week should help. will i feel pressured a lot about godi just don't know if i'm on the right track. i read that the best way to get closer to god is to spend time with him. i so don't do that. i think about god about once or twice a day. i've also heard that the good things we do are reflections of god working in us, or something. i try to remember to do those little things: hold the door for people, smile, encourage people, be honest, but also don't try to be fake friendly, because it's not in anyone's good interest. i just want to be me. god i know that you know the best way for me, don't let me be so selfabsorbed. if i just let go a little, i can go a long way with you. but my gosh it's hard to let go. let me see the ways i can let go. i'm going to go get something to eat for lunch.

" i feel tired and sleepy. i feel that i just want to go to sleep right now. i feel this assignment is making me sleepier. i also feel pain in my stomach and want to do something about it. i feel that i just want to get up go to sleep. i feel that this assignment is boring and really unnecessary. i feel like my stomach is going to explode. i also feel a little stress because of all the things that i want to accomplish today with the little time to do it. i feel that this assignment is never going to end and that my thoughts are just blank right now. i want to get up and go do the things that are really important. my body aches from moving around too much. my stomach still feels like it's going to explode and i can't do anything about it. i'm thinking that i want to call my sister see how everything is going. i talked to her yesterday and it made feel good because i have been feeling kind of homesick and depressed. she is like my life advisor because she is always helping me out with stuff. i feel like i've through a whole semester of school work and i just want to take a vacation and relax and play basketball all day long. playing basketball is the only thing lately that makes feel good. i play a lot but i get tired quick so i can't always play to my full potential. sometimes i just don't want to do anything else during the day so i could just play basketball i work on my game. i wish that i could play all day long and never have to worry about anything else. right now i'm thinking if the major i chose is the right one for me. i don't know if i'm cut out for business. sometimes i feel like i want to devote my time to writing screenplays and playing basketball. i feel like the whole world is holding me back from doing so. sometimes i feel like doing something drastic and just drop out of school and live in southern california, a place that i absolutely love. i also wish i could transfer out of here. i never really wanted to be here. there's too many people with far different attitudes and goals than mine. i wish i was attending college in the northeast, but i would only pursue that if i were sure what i want my major to be. i don't a like a whole lot of things here now that i think about it. i was hoping my attitude about this stupid school would change once i got here but it hasn't. i knew i was going to feel depressed when i came here and that's exactly how i feel. things are moving too slow and i want them to move fast. i'm impatient right now because i feel i have been patient for too long. having an anti-social, computer nerd for a roommate doesn't help much either. his attitude and introvertedness sometime irritates me. i wish i had a different roommate. i feel that school screwed me with this. now i feel that i really wish that i could transfer. i just want to be in a better environment, hopefully somewhere i could find people like me.

"i really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. i know i was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? i don't know why i am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. well, what am i thinking. i first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like i am about to freeze now in the computer lab at kinsolving, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. hell, i hate men right about now, because my man and i broke up a few weeks ago, before i came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. i just don't know what the problem is. i mean if i am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then i can be in a committed relationship. god, i need to get these nails off of my fingers because i keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. i think i'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after i get my navel pierced. i must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. my fingers are starting to hurt because i am having to work extra hard because i have on these freaking nails. i just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. he looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. i know i just said that i hate men, but that was a lie. i can't live without them. especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. god, i want a man! i wonder how i would sound of i started talking all philosophical and stuff. i am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and i bet you are say, then why are you in my class. i think that the you are cool. i mean prof. pennebaker seems to be cool, but anyway. i am so bored right now, i have to braid this dude's hair, and i kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and i need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. i guess i will go for a little while, not too long because i have a class at 930 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? i don't freaking get it. it's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. why? are the powers that be trying to torture me? well, whatever happens, i will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. i just thought about something, i am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to oklahoma for labor day to visit my auntie bev, and my uncle lawrence. i wonder how precious is doing. i hope she still isn't messing with that idiot kevin, like i think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. i mean, i know that i have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but i learned my lesson. i want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when i need it. is that too much to ask for? gee, i can go on and on about men, and the experience s that i have had with them, but that is old and i am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that i can be on the dean's list like i want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and i hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that i do this year and my years to come. i know that i am capable of doing it all, but i just want to survive. this city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!

"i'm curious to know whether or not there is or isn't a timer in this program and if it were possible to just quit typing and claim that 20 minutes have passed. my thoughts and emotions concern my future and what i'm going to do. do i really want to be a psychology major or am i just saying that because it sounds cool. i want to counsel, but id really like to make a ton of money. maybe everyone is right, i should be a business major, that's what everyone else is doing. but i don't want to deal with that crap for the rest of my life. i think its boring and stupid. the future is such a difficult concept to ponder. sometimes i have different goals for it. should i try to satisfy myself, friends or family? i mean it when i tell my friends that i want to be a professional wrestler, it looks so stinking fun. just jumping around and bad acting. well, an acting career would be nice too, but i'm to shy and insecure for that. i think i could do it, but i wouldn't want to associate myself with the thespian weirdoes. i don't think id be able to be my best if i had a problem fitting in with weirdoes. maybe i'm the weirdo. nah. probably not. i may be stereotyping them, but, hey, they're weird man. i've seen the way they act. they put the stereotype on themselves. i'm sure there's a couple nice ones though. i wonder if all the famous actors were at one time like that. my mind just drifted to tricia. she sent me a message saying that she had a couple of dates this past weekend. i wonder how true that is. of course its true, but its weird how she never dated in high school and then all of a sudden at a&m she's a hot item. i still think about that monster crush i had on her my sophomore yr. i wonder if she liked me too. everyone thought she did. but i never had the balls to find out for myself. i'm going to regret that for the rest of my life. i'm such a fucking pussy. the same thing last yr. if i had the balls, i think i could have got something started with erica at baylor. instead, now, we're just good friends. i could have used some support too. but that fucking ray would have been too jealous if erica and i got something started. that prick, i think he could've hooked me up with courtney too. but he needed her, if not, who would he use to cheat on his girlfriend??? then her roommate, darla, man, she's such a little bitch. the thing is, she's not even pretty man. its okay to be snobby and bitchy if your hot, but she was an ugly little girl, with nothing to show for herself. amazing how she was dating all the time. then her fucking attitude about how she has the perfect mate in mind, but wants to date, because its part of the college experience. ray thought like that too. that's such a fucking crock man. as christians they shouldn't be thinking like that. if this almighty god already picked out the perfect mate for them, there is no reason for them to date around to have fun. they love justifying things. there is something wrong with what your doing fi you have to justify it man. and then ray went to that mexico trip to witness to a bunch of poverty stricken mexicans. its funny how he couldn't convert me to christianity in 9 months, but he thinks he can do a whole mexican community within a couple of weeks. i guess its easier when you feed them and shit. talk about taking advantage of people. why don't these gung-ho christians go witness to the people who really ""need jesus"" they should make mission trips to washington d. c. and talk to the politicians. they're the fucking sinners man. and the business people too. they're the ones fucking this world up. working for satan. they don't want to witness to them because they're smarter than them, and they can't find a way to take advantage of them. christianity is fucked up sometimes. sometimes i feel like a hypocrite for going to cbs, but if i didn't i wouldn't know anyone. they're nice and i enjoy being there. but most people there have less of a commitment to god than i do, so oh well. i'm glad i'm at ut though. its way better than baylor, god, i used to get so depressed there. but i'm proud of myself, i toughed out that bullshit. i miss a lot of the guys though. it was a different sort of friendship, but it was cool. i still wonder if i would've stayed if my 1st semester was like the 2nd. but then again i was about to go crazy towards the end. jesse and miguel. and big john almost killed me!! i hope i date here. i think that's all i need to be happy. a good woman. i'd like to have what lijay has, or anything really. i think i'm the only one in our click rite now without someone to ""talk to"". times up. .

"hey what's up? i just got home from school and hopefully i can finish doing this before my sister gets home and takes over the computer. today was cool i got my hair cut finally and the girl that did it was really sweet. i wish my hair was thicker though. i'm trying to type as fast as i can in twenty minutes so i'm wondering how much i'll really end up typing. i can't wait to go to college station this weekend. i hope mom doesn't find out that i ran into that pole in the garage. i think i'm just going to tell her that a car must have hit it. i have the story all planned out and everything. i'd much rather drive karla's car to college station this weekend. i can't wait to see austin again. he's so awesome. i had so much fun at emo's last night, minus the bear rocked. sometimes i feel out of place at that place though because it seems like everyone is trying to hard to look like they don't want to go crazy when the band is playing. i'm so happy they played my favorite song, too. i was surprised how many victoria people were there too. i think nick is so cute too! i haven't seen lynette in a while that was surprising. i wonder if she still thinks i'm a bitch for all that crap in high school. i'm starting to realize that austin isn't as fun as i thought it'd be. it's a crazy place to live, but after being in college station all i think about is how fun it'd be to live there. there's so many teenagers and so much to do at night. the cat's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water. i think i hurt it when he flew off the table. i'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here. i can't remember the last time i ate at the same time karla did. hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off. which doesn't really matter anyways since there's no place to park without having to pay five dollars. i don't like going to eco class very much. i feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and i have no idea what he's talking about. i haven't even been reading as much as i thought i would in school. maybe i should start too because it'll probably start to get hard and then i really won't know what anyone's talking about. i always wonder if austin is getting tired of me. i know he always thinks about getting with another girl, but i'd really like to see what he does and how he is when he's all drunk at some party. that's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and roe fit in with them pretty good i think. i know i should have joined that one group but i think i just wanted to know someone in it before i did. i don't think i could ever afford to pay that much money anyways. i can't even hold on to a hundred in a week. i need to stop buying so many clothes but there's too many cute things i want. i can't wait to get regular cable, these channels suck. i think me and austin will last a long time, we don't fight at all, so maybe being far away can be a good thing. i bet a lot of people think i'm stupid for staying with him ",1,-1.629838 1.196166 1.145278 1.386212 1.739141 0.105931 -1.111948 -0.807516 -1.016428 -0.075461 -0.138671 -0.248869 -0.291047 -0.3175 -1.130168 0.0 -0.04277 -0.324611 0.04252 -0.548298 -0.102791 -0.742368 0.076316 -0.787638 -0.624052 -0.984882 0.389482 -0.501302 0.435054 0.788924 -0.735955 0.348018 -0.208373 -0.906028 1.032911 -0.720146 1.389813 0.122793 1.350844 0.079107 1.906931 0.204686 -0.036553 0.295426 0.235081 -0.443828 -0.144518 -0.531228 -0.481339 -0.218168 -0.303741 0.489648 0.329568 0.192324 -0.161898 0.492708 -0.447737 0.362871 -0.193271 0.253664 0.541289 -0.350215 -0.480161 -0.745201 1.140279 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.291916 -0.841394 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.321947 -0.17798 -0.337085 -0.422267 2.198853 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.009275 4.960155 3.291918 4.832826 4.739191 4.493105

"i don't understand how the man with the questions can be the smarter of the two. the man with the answers has to be the smarter. all the man with the questions know's that he know's what he doesn't know and wants to. but the man with the answers know's. whatever he want to know he knows because that's how the question goes. there's no way for the man with the questions to more than the man with all the answers. one, the answer guy's going to know the answer. and people are always going well does he know how to get the answer?? well of course he does. just ask him how he got that answer. and he'll answer that question. what i don't understand is how this teacher is going to believe and only think that she's right. the answer was completely easy to comprehend. i hate that teachers get so arrogant. just because they know more of the subject they think they're knowledge is invincible against all others. how can you teach others and let them learn if you're unwelling to learn yourself?? it's totally bull. makes no sense to me. always dreamed about being a super hero. guess it's somewhat ironic that my vietnamese name translates to mean hero. i don't know i guess i have some type of super-hero complex. always want to help others always want special powers. always wanted to win the girl. always a dream about this girl. never see a face and can never hear her talk. i can see her figure and i can see how graceful she is. she walks be side me in my dreams. always want to hold her hand but afriad that i'll wake up when i touch her. so i walk beside her and look at her. i know i'm going to meet this person. i can sense it. real into the ""crow"" look the romantic dark super-hero adventure story. brings out the use of love. people always take love for granted and if not love the good fortune that they get to be with or have a relationship with others. wonder if i'm a hopeless romantic. i can see myself taking my date on a walk or just laying there with her and talking. i don't see the sex, not that i wouldn't, or much else. the tai kwon do club at this university is not very well trained. the main instructor may be a good fighter but his form sucks. to me form is the most important part of martial arts. adds gracefulness and at the experienced level makes movements faster stronger and completely balanced. it all comes from form. the traingle is speed balance and strength and not of that comes from bad form. or at least none of those three will continously exel without balance. most people don't see it that way. they think that compromising form for quick speed and strength is better. but they don't look in the long run. just like in chess the game is all about the long run. and with mastering balance, speed and strength will always become faster and stronger. then there are those that are lazy and don't even care for form and try to show off their katas with feet not lined up and hands out of place. with such bad alignment energy will not flow correctly . people get so arrogant and greedy. makes me sick ",1,0.408047 -0.161456 -0.526528 -0.383733 -0.240583 -2.539187 0.86526 1.7597 -0.033161 -0.272367 -0.204411 -0.04908 -0.318062 0.136158 0.027974 0.0 -0.04277 -2.131767 -2.465543 -0.795527 -2.815569 0.040639 1.66261 1.59149 -0.018878 1.919374 -0.188373 -0.593467 0.645026 1.417459 1.27485 3.208505 -0.587944 -0.906028 0.573907 -0.686417 1.869473 0.5925 4.877816 -0.690748 -0.398536 -0.814489 3.445433 0.924787 2.18823 -0.348597 0.281464 1.045771 0.602462 0.932132 2.620834 -1.674904 -1.773124 1.890163 0.449136 -0.790413 -1.213157 -0.238615 1.123308 0.70174 1.246559 -0.241888 -0.480161 1.09802 -0.088502 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.532014 -1.039706 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.634784 -0.37208 0.145863 0.362859 0.730523 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.104308 4.558713 3.623379 4.197649 4.231798 5.041238
"let's see. i'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. not that she's not a cool person or anything, i just can concentrate better when i'm alone and when it is quiet. but that is almost impossibe here in jester. there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. like right now! oh well, it is something i must get used to. or i can do what i did last night. wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night. my fingers are freezing! this room is so cold! i haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. i'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket. i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i cannot wear shorts like i used to back at home. aw, home! i think i am starting to miss being at home. i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. this, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. i do go back home on thursday night, but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta. i am competing in a sports tournament for my church. i am playing flag football and running track. another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i've been dating for less than a month. well, i've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. it's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that, but only because i didn't want to be mean. he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. that was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, i really don't care anymore. he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met. i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. a week after we broke things off, this new guy i'm dating told me he had feelings for me. i was so confused and didn't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks. but i'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. because of that, i decided that i'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. we decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. my ex found out and was extremely jealous. it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. but oh well, that's life i guess. i am really glad i continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. i spent every day with him until the day i left. i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. he is amazing. the only thing i'm worried about is that i'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i don't think i'm quite ready for another one. that's the only problem i'm having right now. the fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. but the distance might become an issue. it was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. but yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut. but i am definitely loving it here in austin. i enjoy all of my professors and classes. having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. in addition i am taking this psychology class, which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. other than that i have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment. ah, my hands are still so cold. what do i do?! my ears are feeling very cold too. must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room?! or my bad, it is the fall now. same thing. today is the day for my mile run. ever since i moved to austin, i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym. i absolutely love that place! and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester. freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape! i find that i've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer. i really love this lifestyle i have at ut. the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but i do not feel like i am abusing it. i did party a lot this weekend, but i didn't drink or anything. people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. i don't want people to view me as a party girl because i'm not out of control or anything. oh well. i see that this writing is almost up. that wasn't too bad!

"the light above my computer is shining so brightly onto the screen. the bright light, almost blinding as i try not to look straight into it. my mind works rapidly as i am trying to focus on my thoughts. whenever i actually try to think of something my head seems to go blank and i can think of nothing. i guess i don't really think of nothing because the brain is working all the time. there is always some sort of idea or made up story in my head. when i am alone, such as when i walk to class i always daydream about fictional stories or ideal occurrences that i would want to happen in my life. then i worry that since i thought of it, it would never actually happen like that. i do not believe we can predict the future. unless dreams are a prediction. usually my dreams predict nothing and just are a picture in my head of the things i have been thinking about most often. sometimes they are ridiculous and make absolutely no sense but that could be our imaginations working. i don't seem to get very much sleep. i wonder if that is bad because i am not resting enough and do not have as many chances to dream. i think dreaming is healthy and so much fun when you have a good, inspirational one. our minds our so interesting. why do they work the way they do? will this question ever be answered? why are people the way they are? it is so interesting to analyze people and their actions but many times i cannot comprehend why they think and act the way they do. such as when they focus on all the unimportant aspects of life that really have no meaning. it is so special when i can actually find a person that i have a good conversation with. i left all my friends like that and am searching for those people here in austin. they have to be somewhere, considering there are thousands of people here. those conversations that leave you feeling in the best mood with a huge smile on your face are the best ones. when you've realized you've shared something amazing with that person or when you were just able to really understand what each other were thinking. those are the people that leave an impact in my life. those are the people that moved far away from me and are only reachable by a long distance phone call. these amazing friends are irreplaceable and i am only hoping to find people that come close the type of people i have known. this was something i was kind of worried about when i came here. would i be drawn into the bubble of people's lives that move in a cycle with no positive direction at all as to who they are going be? will i be strong enough to keep my attitude, hopes, and feelings about the person i am or want to be? i have found direction, the getting there is the problem. i am actually listening to the song patience right now and i think it has a good message. this song makes me sad every time i listen to it. it is tied to such strong memories and now especially because i have left many of the people i love. it is hard when i think about this person. i miss them so and my body aches when i think about not seeing them for such a long time. this is maybe one of the hardest parts about college: the fact of moving on and leading a new life with out the people you have loved for so many years. maybe, but my time is up now, and the rest of my thoughts will only exist in my mind.

"well after labor day weekend i had come to the conclusion that i disliked the college life. everything had gone so wrong that weekend. the book store sent me home with the wrong book, i didn't have my ""if"" account so i couldn't check my email, and i bought a twenty dollar calling card that is supposed to be better than the one i had been buying and it was a rip off. the tendollar card had more minutes on it than than the twentydollar card, and to top that off the darn thing only had sixteen dollars on it. so my weekend was just a bunch of carp. i am not exactly home sick, but i do miss my baby brother and my fianc'. i went home this past weekend, missed the first football game here, and saw the two people i missed most. it was so cool to be home everybody was so happy to see me, it was great. i am planning on joining a sorority here to keep me busy so i won't get home sick. i haven't really met anyone here yet. the girls on my floor aren't very friendly. when i first got here i was bored out of my mind, but now things are looking better. i am not real in to sixth street, but the first week i was here some friends that live here took me there. i got my tattoo on sixth street when we were here for orientation. i keep saying we, my best friend and i that is. my best friend is my roommate and she is trying to get me to enjoy it here and not miss home too much. i have to say i do like the fact that my parents can't tell me what to do, and when to be home and all the other things that parents tell their kids to do. i was ready to get away and be on my own. my fianc' is at home going to school there. hopefully he will come up here next year. we are supposed to get married this summer, but i guess we will have to see what happens. it is so weird to see everyone outside smoking in the middle of the night, and to see people going out at three in the morning. at home we have a curfew, and they are real strict about it too. other than all that stuff, i am adjusting pretty well to the college life and am learning to love it. things can only get better, right. i know i made it sound like i just hate it here, but i don't. the weekend at home was enough to hold me off for awhile. that one bad weekend made me think that it was always going to be like that. next time i will be writing about how much i love it here, and i won' t have anything to complain about.

"i am an architecture major. therefore i do not sleep. last night i was able to sleep simple because i couldn't go any longer without closing my eyes. i wish that i had the choice to fall asleep and wake up at will. that time would simply stop when my head hit the pillow (or drafting table) so that i wouldn't lose any work time. if this were so, life would be much easier. without taking time out of my life to shower, eat or sleep i could get everything done. what is the true purpose of bathing anyway? i mean, i do it for the simple fact that i'm told by society that it's necessary for me to be accepted by the general populous. but, in all reality, if we didn't shower none of us would know the difference. i think that's my main complaint about the world in which we live. there is too much us. why can't it just be i, sometimes? rather than worry constantly about what sarah might wear or what jessica might do with her hair, why can't we just live and experience and be without the everpresent pressure of impression and attitude. when, i'm inclined to wonder, did everyone begin to care so much about trying so damn hard to lose their own individuality. what's the most disgusting, i believe, is that there are those out there who try so hard to find their own that, eventually, even that catches on, and then, once again, they become part of a click or group. here in lies my love and passion for architecture. but, it will also be my crutch, and possibly my ultimate failure. with it i can create and design and people will experience what i'm feeling and they won't be able to say, ""wow, that's cool, why don't i do that,"" without enlisting my services. (in a perfect world) they will, however, be able to say ""wow, that's cool (or awful as the case may be) i want to be in this space. "" on the opposite note, however, the only way i'll be able to express myself through my work will be to appeal to the masses or at least a mass large enough to want to pay me to build my building. so, in order for me to survive and be able to be different and interesting, i will have to find a group of people that are on the same wavelength as i am, which is essentially what i'm trying to avoid. it's a catch22 and there's no way around it. i suppose i could step to the side and be a howard roark of the world and live day by day surviving off the few people who may honor my integrity and desire for design, but, just like everyone else, i crave human contact and acceptance. i am too afraid of myself to be myself. i am too afraid to find out that i don't know what i am or to realize that everything i thought was, i'm really the opposite of and have only been playing a game my entire life, just trying to make an impression. i am so scared that i really am a failure, but somehow i've been lucky. somehow, i pulled off those sat's and i pulled off those straight a's, but as soon as i find out who i really am, i'll fall off of this full speed train toward success and end up in a field somewhere surrounded by no one. i don't even want to be successful anymore. i don't even want to be anymore. i just want to experience. i just want to know and think without the pressure of success or failure. i'm not sure what we're all trying for, but i do know that whatever it is, can wait until we've died.

"i still feel sleepy because i just got up a few minutes ago. i am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. my computer told me that i misspelled consciousness, but i don't believe it. i have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. i lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so i'm still mad about that since i only found out a little while ago. it makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. the book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and i just lost the last two lectures. oh well. i am thinking that i am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. the wp still thinks that i can't spell and i'm becoming irritated because i can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. i thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. it's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. i wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. hot, probably. i can't wait for the cool weather to come. this oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and i love to do stuff outside. well, that's not true. it doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. i'm thinking that i've already written a lot for only about 9 minutes. makes you wonder. i am wishing that i had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since i paid for them. i need a better study ethic. i think that i've been putting in about half the studying that i need to, but i haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so i'm not sure whether i should worry yet. i'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and i've been thinking about that a lot lately. i feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. maybe after a while, i won't feel that way anymore. i'm sure i won't, just look at my sister. and my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. i feel i should include my brother. i worry sometimes how i come off, how other people see me. but other times, i couldn't care less how they see me. i think it's justified, i'm not a hypocrite, i just have an idea of myself and how i want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that i make an effort on them, and with other things, if i don't seem to care, then that is how i want to be seen. i realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what i'm comfortable with. i don't believe in diaries. if i ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then i wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. i would destroy it. kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. ""destroy it. "" like it came from a movie or something. ""destroy it. "" i'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and i think that i've spent too much time correcting typos. not that i make a lot of typos, but when i do, i always go back and fix them before i go on with my writing. i'm feeling sleepy again and i think i'll go make some coffee.

"my name is oscar criel. i really don't know what i'm supposed to write but i guess i'll start anyway while i have some free time. i don't know if we're supposed to word wrap this thing or not so forgive me for the excessive going out of the lines. i just barely made it here to the ugl and decided ""why not and just do my homework while i have time. "" today in psych class it was pretty boring. i just wish we did something a little more interesting. i took this class because an old girlfriend'friend recommended taking this class. she told about her psych class and how interesting it was. so far i like the class but i wish we could start on some interesting facts. i still haven't bought my psych book and i hope i can hang on for one more day. i'm really just worried about whether my financial aid is coming in. i also miss home already. i decided not to go home over the holidays so i could stay here and hang out with my friends. but i think i made the wrong decision. even though i came during the summer i still miss home. for that whole month in the summer of 97 i just thought about going home. i was in the preview program for the summer but i don't regret being in that program. i met some of the coolest people during the summer than i have my whole entire life. my old friends seem like dumb asses when compared to the ones i met. i just wish i didn't feel so insecure about math. i hate math. i used to be good in it when i was in jr. high and the beginnings of my high school life. but during my jr. and sr. year i really slacked off and got my first c's from my pre-cal class and my calculus class. that's one of the reasons i came during the summer so i could take pre-cal. that was one of the worst classes i have ever taken. i got my first d in the summer and my dad wasn't to happy. he graduated from ut and he wants me to do the same. i'll try not to disappoint him but i don't know what the future holds for me. i just wish i wasn't in a major that required taking a math class. but i hope i get an a average this fall. i better. i just need to work more smarter and know and learn how to study better. plus i have a work study job now and i hope that doesn't drag me down. i guess it's almost been twenty minutes but i still got about three more minutes to go . it's weird but i didn't think i could type for a solid twenty minutes without stopping for a five minute rest or something. one ting i know right now is that i am starving. that damn job is costing me my lunch. i think i have to start packing a lunch every time i go to work. i need to buy meal replacement bars when i get my first paycheck. i just hope it's more than a hundred dollars. i forgot but i need to call my dad and ask about the financial aid. i guess i'll call him tonight and maybe he could sort out things. i feel so tired. i just want to go back home and sleep for ever. but i know that wouldn't be the wise thing to do. college sucks. i just wish things came a lot more easier to me. i have no more thoughts. i am just stuck here typing on a computer. well i better go eat now and hope that i typed enough for this assignment. one down and one to go. i guess i'll see you in class. bye.

"yuck, what a cruddy day. i had to go to 4 hours of classes and then i had to wait 30 minutes for the freaking bus to pick us up. then i had to stand up for most of the ride home. and it was really hot on the bus. luckily today wasn't too hot outside though. i saw on the news that we are expecting some rain and cooler weather. that's good. i guess. i don't know about the rain part though. i hope i can find my umbrella. i hope i didn't lose it when i moved up here. i live in a really neat apartment now. i like it a lot. and my roommate is really nice too. i was kind of worried about that. i transferred here from a&m this semester. i like it here. but it's not really any different than in college station. just bigger. my classes aren't any harder so far. i hate calculus. i'm usually pretty good at math. i think it's also because my ta that teaches our discussion is horrible. he hardly speaks english and doesn't know what he's doing at all. of course i don't' really know what i'm doing at all either but. wow 20 minutes is a long time. lots of random stuff kind of floats through your head. like the fact that i can see that i have email and i really want to check it. i just checked it before i started writing, i guess somebody wrote back. i wonder who. probably amy. amy was supposed to transfer this year too and be my roommate but she forgot to send in her transcript. she's kind of spacey about stuff like that. but she's like the sweetest person i know. actually i don't really know a lot of people here. that's kind of sad considering i knew practically everyone at my high school and i had a lot of friends at a&m. my roommate at a&m just rushed a sorority this year. neither one of us rushed last year. i'm happy for her. i wonder if i should've rushed this year. then i'd know more people. but my boyfriend goes to school here. but he doesn't know that many people here either. the year just started so i guess i'll meet more people as it goes by. i need to go workout tonight. i haven't worked out really well in a few days. i feel much better and more relaxed after i work out. i'm still feeling kind of stressed after my gross day. i have a lot of homework to do and a lot of other things on my list. i always make lists. i wonder what that says about a persons personality. i'm really organized and like to plan things. maybe that's part of it. strange. i wanted to plan a trip to go tubing in san marcos before school started but we never got around to it. i hate how my boyfriend makes fun of me and says that i never plan anything. i know he's just kidding, but it gets on my nerves. he just doesn't understand i guess. wow i just got a weird flashback of high school. i was a cheerleader and i just thought of some performance we did. i wonder where that came from. my typing has gotten really good over the past year. i used to not be that great. i think all the emailing made me better. i wonder who that email is from? i haven't seen a lot of the people that i know here. i guess i should call them and get together. i feel like i don't have time though. i have to do homework, and work out and i need time to myself just to vege. speaking of vegetables, i need to go to the grocery store too. i need vegetables, noodles, rice, chicken, cookies, hmm what else? milk. i like milk, especially with my cereal. i need more cereal too. i always want to get pancake mix. yummy. only a few minutes left. that's good because my back-neck-shoulder is starting to hurt from sitting at this computer. i need to get a cable so i can hook up my printer. not that i need it yet but i should get that taken care of. my mom said she is sending me a package with cookies and candy and my last paycheck from work (lifeguard)and other stuff. that is something to look forward to. i haven't gotten any mail lately. i paid my rent today. through january. i need to call my bank and have them transfer some money form my savings into my checking. or else we could have some problems. but my grandfather is the president of the bank and my aunt is the ceo so i don't think that they'd let me bounce a check. that's going to be a shock when i have to go out and get a real job and find a real bank. time's up. yea!

"ok so what am i doing right now? this is really weird, i've never really had to think about my thoughts like this and actually record them. i really don't want to be writing this right now. i would rather be watching bring it on"" with my roommate right now. man i am so tired. i would also really like to go to bed right now and the sad thing is it's only like 7:30. i really haven't been getting too much sleep here. i've been too busy. man my whole body just hurts because i'm so tired. even though i'm so tired i know i won't go to sleep till late. why do i do that? man i'm so distracted right now. all i want to do is watch that movie. i'm hearing the scene right now and i don't even have to see the picture because i know what is happening because i've seen the movie so many times. this dorm life is so different for me. i'm use to being able to get away and escape in my room, but i can't do that here. it's weird i always have someone around, whether it's my roommate or a friend from down the hall. don't get me wrong i love having people around all the time, it would just be nice every once in awhile to have some alone time and reflect on some things. but i doubt that will happen anytime soon. i can't get the fact out of my head right now that i'm so tired. i really should take a nap or just go to bed. but that won't happen. i really miss some of my friends from back at home. it's so different because i went from seeing my best friends everyday to now barely ever seeing them or barely ever talking to them. i told myself before i went off to school that i wouldn't let this happen but it has only been about three weeks and i've already let it happen. that makes me sad. my friends back at home were such a big part of my life and now it seems that they are almost being replaced. i've meet some awesome people down the hall and i really enjoy hanging out with them. man i can't concentrate. the movie is so distracting. see right now at home i wouldn't be typing here with all this sound. i would have gone into my own room and been able to focus. but i've realized that in college you really can't do that. right now my roommate is blow drying her hair, that is also distracting me. i need some peace and quite sometime. but that rarely happens. i'm so excited about the football game this weekend and the fact that the weekend is coming up. i love not having to worry about classes and i love being able to relax and really enjoy myself. that kind of makes it sound like i don't have a good time ever but i do i just love the weekends. my roommate is laughing at the movie and i just want to be finished with this so i can watch it with her. i'm really happy that my roommate and i are getting along so well. i really had my doubts when i came to school with her. but it has been great so far. watch that all of the sudden change because i'm talking about how good it is right now. with my luck something like that would happen. the hair dryer started up again. i really do have trouble focusing with all the sound around me. the people down the hall are so noisy. they play computer games till all hours of the night and yell so loud at the screen. i really don't understand that. nothing can be solved my yelling at a stupid screen. it's like the same idea of yelling at the t. v. during a football game. it's so stupid. but people will always do it.

"so here i am sitting at my computer. i am supposed to be doing my homework that i put off all week, i guess you could call this homework though. its a little cold in here, i haven't taken a shower yet. i hope my roommate doesn't just come home and i'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. i wish i could go home to see my family and friends. but i don't have the money. i hate my job. i wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe i'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. i'm hungry and my feet are cold. i wonder why it is that whenever i get hungry i get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever i get cold i get hungry. i don't think the second floor dining opens until 4:30, if even that, i can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. i really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since i dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time i get them, or were sent earlier in the day. i should really take a shower, i feel sticky. i think its from the ice cream. i just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day i might think about that, but today i've got bigger things to worry about. i like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which i think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. i would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. i wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. i mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday i was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than i did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so i said something, and it wasn't even mean, i just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. i couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, i hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. i think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. i know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. i couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time i get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did i buy two packs of gum? i went to wal-mart yesterday and for whatever reason i bought two packs of gum. i don't' even chew gum that often. maybe i bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, i think she was catching the 3pm bus out of san antonio. i'm going home next weekend. i'm supposed to catch a bus at 4 and get to dallas at 7:45. i guess we'll have to make some stops because i've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 3 hours. but i probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. i told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on friday, sat, or sundays because i didn't know when i was going out of town. and what did he do? schedule me for this friday. well i already bought the tickets and if i don't go home this weekend i'm going to go crazy. i miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. i miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. i got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. i don't talk to him anymore. i wonder if he even knows i'm here. samantha knows, i remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. i mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it i can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this? it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and i haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me? i don't know. well i should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening.

"well i'm a bit nervous about this. not that i really have any reason to be nervous, but college in general has been all new to me and a bit scary and overwhelming. i'm really tired right now, but i can't go to sleep because i have so much to do. my body is getting so run down. i really ought to take care of myself, i know. well, i did go to yoga today. besides, if i go to bed early, my roomie will stay up and make noise, something that makes me unable to sleep. unfortunately, only i have early morning classes. not her. but i love jenny. best friend, ya know. oh well. i wish i could have more time to study though. then i would have more time to sleep. then i would enjoy life a bit more, i think. i liked hearing in psych today that everyone is stressed first semester of freshman year. i truly did think i was the only one. well yippee! i'm not alone! although, i don't think everyone is juggling 15 hours, with work, organizations, and a lot of time-consuming friends! but i guess a lot of people have their own time problems. like if they are in a frat or sorority or something. those apparently take a lot of time. that's totally not my kind of thing though, so i'm glad that i'm not doing it. also, being in sports takes a lot of time i'm sure. band too. brandon is in band. he says it's a lot of fun, but i think it wouldn't be my thing either. unless they sang in band. in which case, i would really enjoy it. or dance. dance is awesome. i really miss it. but you know, when i went clubbing this weekend, i really hated it. i hated how guys treated me like a piece of meat and basically violated my personal space and being. i felt like crap. i really hated it. and the thing is, i really wanted to hit the library that night, but nooooo, they said i would enjoy the club because it was salsa dancing - one of my favorites. wouldn't you know it - they had like one salsa song. man, that was upsetting. it turned out to be a horrible night. i mean, horrible. jenny is going to bed now. that's a first. she always goes to bed after me. seriously, that's a first. i hope i don't wake her by typing. actually my comp is kind of quiet now that i think about it. besides, she claims she is not disturbed by little sounds. so good. i don't think it'll be too much of a problem. my head hurts. and this light shining on my keyboard is actually making my fingers hot. that's kind of creepy. i don't think lights are supposed to do that. oh well. i really have to use the bathroom now. hah. i bet that's a psychological thing. i only feel that way just because i know i can't leave the computer because i've got 12 more minutes left. how does this thing work? how can this computer tell me what my psyche is like? i mean, its a computer! how is it able to read what i have written, and then analyze it and give me a response? hehe, maybe the tas have to stay at the computer 24-7 so they can write in the responses. hehe. sorry, mr. ta. i know that's not funny. oh my god it's late. i'm talking to the non-existent ta, i'm so tired. well if it weren't for all that studying i tried to finish, it wouldn't be so late! but of course, even after spending almost every free moment i had today, reading, i still am not even anywhere near catching up in reading! it's all because of that stupid, stupid sociology class i dropped! i'm seriously upset about that! i mean, that class was by far the hardest class in terms of reading assignments. if only i had add'dropped the class sooner, i wouldn't have wasted all of my precious time on that one class. and then i end up switching sociology classes. man. i make myself so mad sometimes. well, hey. i am a freshman and new to all of this stuff. i guess it'll just take me awhile to figure all these things out. ut is so huge. i don't know if i will ever get used to the size. actually, i'm not sure it's fully hit me yet anyway. but how on earth did i end up here? i was headed for famous, private colleges in the northeast, that were small, which was my main want in a college. yet i've ended up at the biggest! alex is calling on my cell. poor guy. he is had such a rough night. but hey bub. i'm doing my homework right now. i hope he doesn't think that i'm ignoring him. well i am, i guess. but i do plan on calling him back. although that would mean sacrificing more sleep, but oh well. he needs someone right now. i think that's also a problem i have. i spend to much time with my friends. too many friends sometimes. sometimes it seems like there aren't enough. strange how that is. well i know online (aim) i definitely have enough friends to talk to. that's so hard. aim always sucks me in because i get to talk to people who live far away and that i never get to see. i waste so much valuable time on that! ugh. i procrastinate too much. well, no, that's not true. i spend a lot of time doing important things. and i guess aim and hanging out with friends are my way of relaxing and taking a break. although they really aren't breaks. because they require so much emotion, and attention, and energy! so then i need even more sleep! but that's just something i can't ever get! same with in high school! ugh. i was such an overachiever. all that for nothing though. ut didn't even look at all the extra work i did. replacing lunch for a class. not having any free time because of all the organizations and officer positions. so much going on. and all ut looked at was the fact that i was in the top 2%. whoopee. now i'm in. i think that makes ut a lot less prestigious. for that very reason, ut was my backup school. because it was so easy for me to get into. ooh, time is almost over. last thoughts, anj? no. i keep thinking about sleep. hehe. i can't get it off my mind. maybe that's a sign. but i need to call alex. eeks. jenny is moving. did i wake her up? oh, i can continue? nah. i think this is enough. besides, i need sleep!

"my eyes are closed right now and i'm wondering if i'm doing things correctly. i just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. i wish i was there with her right now to talk everything out. its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. i am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. i want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. i'm just very exhausted. i've been going nonstop this entire weekend. just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as i type words on this keyboard. i feel it in my neck and the back. i just want to go to sleep. . but i must go on if i'm going to finish all my assignments. i'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. i think i'm going to do my psychology tonight. and here i am. i'm tired but i don't want to sleep. i don't want my weekend to end. it's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . if i don't sleep yet, maybe i could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. i've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. now i am wondering whether i'm doing this right. how can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. i'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think i'm insane after reading this. i rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. how can we truly define that word? i think everyone has a little insanity in them. just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term insane pretty difficult and complicated. it's not like there is a standard of being sane. everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? i think its amazing how i wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. i have another thought. my uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. are they insane? how could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them? i wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the ideal normal i don't think they do because schizophrenia is their normal. besides, who is to judge the ideal normal? i read a book by timothy findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own? i guess this question is a double edged sword. take from it what you will. i still have no idea. anyway, am i doing this correctly? oh here's another thought. . how do you know if i'm doing this correctly. it's my stream of consciousness. whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. for me i think it's normal. i write these kind of thoughts in a journal. i think the only reason why i'm sort of unsure is that i'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment. i am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. i'm actually kind of relaxed now. more sleepy. i think my 20 minutes is up.

"today i am leaving for my grandfather's funeral. i am so sad that he had to pass on. i know that he is in a better place now and can no longer feel pain, but i wish he was still here. even if he could only stay for a few minutes. i just want to tell him how important he is to me and how much i love him. i would tell him how strong he is and how everyone looked up to and admired him. i wish that i could tell him how jealous i am of him, because his life was so interesting and fulfilled. but, most of all, i would tell him how much i love him. i am not really sad that my grandfather has passed away, i am sad because there is so much left unsaid. i just hope that he already knows everything that i wish i would have told him, before it was too late. i find it so odd that every time someone you know or love passes on, you sit and ponder all of the things that you wish you would've told them and vow to never make that mistake again. but time passes so quickly that you never get the chance to tell everyone that means anything to you that the are important, that they are somebody to you. i guess that my twenty minutes is up.

" well, apparently i'm supposed to just type for 20 minutes. being that it is september 11, i suppose it would a good topic. everywhere i look i see something about 9'11. even the clock at ut is stopped at 7:46. all of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 9'11. the first thing i did this morning was turn on the television, almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 9'11. why? so i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else. it's almost a sense of deja vous or something. (i don't speak french). i really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though. i sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers hadn't collapsed. would everyone be okay less 500 people? i'm really ready to see us attack iraq. iraq is just a big problem. i've always carried myself with little opinion because why should i, me, say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be. i don't know much, all i know is what the news tells me. how can anyone say we shouldn't attack iraq? if we do, i am confident that it was the right thing to do. people just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do, we'd probably say the same thing. these new what if america wasn't america? commercials are really fascinating. i find them very effective. i mean, a man goes to the library, and wants to find some books, it doesn't even matter the topic, and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested. i never really thought about that. i mean, i can go to the library, pick up a book on atomic bombs, check it out, and no one asks a word. it's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned. that's pretty cool. actually, my favorite commercial related to 9'11 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are, and they say: terrorists goal is to change the way of life of america or something like that, and then it shows the next day us flags hung all over the building and says they succeeded. that is just a cool commercial. i remember when there used to be flags everywhere. now you're lucky if you ever see them. i guess that's not natural to be so patriotic. i think we saw so many flags because we needed to be reminded that we all have something in common and we need to stick together. the news is starting to get on my nerves finally. what is really weird is me, probably like many other people, were wondering what today would be like. would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison? i even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more. what happens? everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 9'11 in their thoughts, but refuses to let it take them down. it seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that. for a while after 9'11 i was pretty scared. i wondered what was going to happen. i almost didn't even want to be in the country. but then, when thinking about what i'd be giving up, i realized that even if the us is under attack, it's still the best country in the world. now they are doing the i am an american commercial. they are analyzing how the different people say it. makes me wonder how i would say it if i were to be on tv. would i say it proudly, or with anger in voice (toward the terrorists), sadly, or just normal. the different tones were amazing. i never looked that much in the to the commercial until now. wow. i bet now most people would say it proudly, but what about a week after the attacks? would you not say it with pride, yet more sorrow. there is just a huge amount of commercials on tv that deal with this situation. although commercials are effective, i feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music. music is so powerful. you know, when you're hearing that god bless the usa or america the beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits. similar to church i suppose. whenever i'm at church i get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved. that's exactly how i feel when i hear those patriotic songs. well, i suppose in many ways, god was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing. the sunday after 9'11 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches. i know i was at church. everyone just needed to hear something good. i don't really worry about that stuff anymore. i figure it's like worrying i'm going to get the red nile virus or whatever. i mean, they act like it's the terrible virus but it hasn't even killed 20 people. heat kills more people than that. let's go worry about heat now. no need to worry so much anymore, it is time to enjoy life.

"it's sunday and i need to go to church since i didn't go this morning because i woke up at 11:15 and church is at 11:30. so i already took a shower and i'm dressed to go at 8:00 p. m. right now it's 7:25 and i wish it was about 4 because it seems like the day has just went by and i haven't done very much. that's alright though because i'm listening to my favorite rap music. trick daddy dollars, ja rule, dmx, ice cube, hot boys, juvenile, black & dangerous, k-roc, too short, twista, and jt money they seem to make me feel better. even if i'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. she got mad because i was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where i was at. so i had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. i was mad also because i gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. so we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that i didn't approve of. so i was instantly angered because i have a short temper to begin with. it was a big deal really but i don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. so we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. she decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. i acted like i didn't care so we just ended it there. this worries me because i hate to end it like that but i'm so hardheaded that i won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. it also hard because i'm here and she's 355 miles away and i can't see her the way i use to. i guess i'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what i'm use to. the girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people i've never seen so many people in one place at one time. being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that i'm not used to. hopefully i'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. i don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. whatever happens i'll just try to do my best and do the best i can as things come along.

"i don't like being home alone as much as i thought i would like it. i want talia to come back already. i can't believe she also takes zoloft this is too weird. i kinnda want her to be normal because now i just think the both of us are too weird together. it was such a coincidence that we got paired up together as roomates. i was talking to chris and everytime i do i feel so much more homesick. i can't decide if like him or not. well i like him. but i don't know if i like him more than a friend. i probably like william more. yes i do. i wonder what he is doing right now. it is raining and i don't like that. i hate the rain. i feel scared that something bad will happen. this song is funny. i guess they don't like jermaine dupri. i had some really good french vanilla coffee but now my throat hurts because it was way too hot. i really miss charm and all the guys. i felt so sad because they went out without me. ok the comp just made a strange noise that i don't like. that really scared me i thought i had broken talia's computer. i would really be in trouble then. damn it feels like i've been writing for longer than 6 mins. but oh well. i wonder wat chris is doing right at this moment. i wish i could see him. he can always make me laugh. speaking of funny people, i really miss emy. he's the love of my life, without it being in any way romantic. i would do anything for him and i worry about him so much. i really hope he is doing ok because if he isn't i would drop everything hear in austin just to be with him. the people in my floor piss me off all the time because they are always yelling and i can't stand that they don't have the courtesy to be quiet at night. they really annoy me. i wonder if that comedy show is going to be on tonight. i really like that show. i wish i had more of that coffee. even though it burned my throat. i ate pizza today and it wasn't the best thing in the world. i'm going to remember that for next time. i eat way too much sometimes. i am so fat i don't need to eat more. how the hell did i get to weigh so much? i just can't believe it. i hate walking around and seeing all those pretty girls. i spend most of the day being jealus of them all. i don't know how to make myself stop eating and to start working out. i mean i have a gym right downstairs but even that embarrasses me because i don't want people to see the fat girl working out. that's why people work out, to lose weight. but i just can't get out of that mindset. it is way too cold in my room. i'm going to get sick. i have to do so much homework. especially biology because i don't understand anything in that class and we might have a quiz next week. i won't do too good on that. chemistry is pretty good i think. i got a little confused last night with the homework but i'm hoping to work that out. biology 212 is not that bad. at least i don't feel like falling asleep right then and there like in bio 211, i really don't like my instructor. she's so damn boring and she tries to be funny but i doesn't work. i really hope i don't do too bad this semester. i hope to get at least b's in all my classes. a's are impossible in college i think. i'm really worried about my scholarship from d. d. hachar, i haven't gotten the half from ut that i'm supposed to get. i really should call the office or stop by. and i should also go and settle the matter with the mental health office too, i don't want maribel to keep bugging me about it. this is really not cool, i don't want to have to do that. but oh well. i guess if i have to. i should write an email to the finacial aid office asking them about my scholarship. or maybe i should try to contact the nursing school. maybe i don't even have that scholarship anymore. that would suck if i don't. i really need the money. i don't want my parents to worry about me or money. i can't wait until i have money of my own to help them out. i wonder if i'll ever become famous like i always dream about. i dream about so many things itz hard to keep track. i'm almost done. wow, that went by quickly. this wasn't so bad. i wonder if they're really going to read this thing. i doubt they have time.

"i don't know what i am going to do in this. this type of assignment is something i have not done before. i guess i have no idea is because that i do not have a topic to write on. i have always have had a topic assigned to me. this is el-hazard music. just by looking at the images of the cd cover, i can tell that this is going to be good. in fact, i am listening to it right now. i have no idea why i am writing this down in here, but it is a part of my thought. this has a lot of base, but it does not stick out. has a very good balance of treble and base. what am i going to write about. i am hungry. may be i can go to kinsolving later. i think that they start dinner at four thirty. another track has started. this is a slow song now. it is the music from the fourth episode where the demon goddess is freed from her master's control and gained her freedom for the first time. the cat ura was cool. she can mountain climb. i think that was a cliff. she is the coolest cat ever. i have to do this for 20 minutes. what oh yes the ura. the series is el-hazard. they don't have anything good on the internet on it. this sucks. i have to download that song tonight. i hope this time the connection is good enough. why is some of the music stupid. wait, if i listen to this closely, it is very good if the voice of the actress is older. the story has good development. the ova series starts with the discovery of the demon goddess ifurita in a certain high school and the main guy is sent to the world el-hazard through a portal created by ifurita. why is the tv series different from the oav series. the princess rune venus looks cute, i like her better in the ova series. i think a world like el-hazard lives in our hearts. rune venus was rescued by the teacher. that was cool. fugisawa kick. there were this little girl in the story. she was aielle. the 3 priestess was pretty. fire, wind and water. reminds me of ah megamisama. 15 minutes. ifurita was awakened by junnai. then he and ifurita invaded roshiraria the kingdom of el-hazard. they had to use the eye of god for defense. the tv series was called the wanderers. that was cool. the main guy can access ancient relics. he gave back ifurita her freedom by turning off the master obey chip. the war was still going on the roshitaria used the eye of god. kimdom of bugrom got kicked. the shadow nation intervened. the moved the eye of god out of control for the revenge a long time ago. they were remnant of the tribe that come across this world when the eye was first fired. they were hated afterwards. makoto. i am hooked on this series too much. the main guy got control of the eye through ifurita but ifurita sustained the impact and was transported to the location where the high school will be in 10000 years. ifurita then waited 10000 years for makoto to appear and send makoto to the land of el-hazard. after the impact, ifurita learned the secret of eye of god. it is a dimensional cannon. what was cool. is it 20 minutes yet. still 2 minutes. have i been keeping time correctly. kor orange road. i am still listening to the same music. cool. i can't wait to see the tv series tape # 2. it is going to be very good. i don't know i guess i am too excited about this thing to stop, i have not even realized i stayed on the same topic for long. men.

"right now it is 1:40. i don't really know what to write about. but, i guess i will just go with the flow. i can't really get use to this computer, because it keeps skipping lines and messing up. i got it about one month ago. i guess that over all it is pretty nice. i am so full. i just ate breakfast , and i think that my stomache is going to explode. but that is okay. i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this. sorry, this is a bit abstract. i would hate to have to sit there and read over five hundred of these papers. wow, it has only been five minutes and i still have fifteen minutes left. i can't believe that school has only been going on for two weeks. it is weird because it seems like i have done a lot in the past two weeks. but, it seems to be going really fast. i think that my next test is next week . who said. . sorry listening to leah anrioni. most of her songs have to do with questioning god's or man's motives. it is actually interesting to just listen to the lyrics. i wonder whi write her songs. i guess i could just look at the cd, but i'm too lazy. i wdonder if i should call jr. oh, sorry that is my boyfriend. i would have to wait till i am done with this anyway. i wonder what my life would be like if i had gone out of state. a long distance relationship would not have worked. too much time away from him. and i guess too much room to doubt his'my actions. this is better, because later i can always go. when is the first test in this class? i hope that i didn't have to read anything for next time. god, i keep hitting thr caps lock. that is so annoying. i hate reading my professors book in religios studies. he probably made us get it just to increas the book sells. that woould be kinda funny if he read this. well, not really, but i would laugh about it in about a year. three more minutes. i think melissa went back to san antonio today. i don't really want seema, my room mate, to come back. she is nice , but it has been nice to not have to listen to her talk all the time. i pretty much like my space. and she talks all the time. but i am sure that there are some very annoying things about me also. hey , my time is up. later.

" wow i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing for this assignment. i knew about a book that i was supposed to read in english class last year that was supposedly written in stream of consciousness but since i never read it i have no idea what it was about. instead i read crime and punishment. that was probably the most depressing book i have ever read. right now i'm reading a tom clancy novel, which is much more exciting. i can't wait to go back to dallas this weekend to see my family and girlfriend. they are all so excited. plus i get to see my grandma and actually get some real food. man the food here sucks. sure there's variety, but half the time they don't even have something green out there. i mean how the hell are we not supposed to get that freshmen 15 if they aren't even giving us some friggin green beans. my allergies are killing me. i think i almost died last nite i was coughing so much, and i'm sure i kept my roommate up. but i don't really care. he shafted me. he was going to give me a ride to dallas this weekend but instead, he made his girlfriend come down so now he won't take me. he could have just seen her down there, but he didn't want to have to be around adult supervision for that long. oh well, i'll get him back. hehehe. yeah so my arms are definitely starting to get tired. i definitely haven't done this much typing since fourth grade with mr. colonna. that was the year that i was introduced, and subsequently failed fractions. damn i hate fractions. with mrs. hatch. evil lady. there is so much reading that i have to do for my classes but so far i am really liking them. i took five pages of notes today in my architecture class, but at the end i was ready to take more. we were talking about hitler and the nazi's, but mainly about the architect that hitler hired to build his sets for his speeches, and the headquarters of the nazi party. i'm now listening to pink floyd and i feel as though i'm on a space ship. this is some crazy stuff. i use this cd to put me to sleep every nite. and usually by the second song i'm asleep. it is so cold in this room i'm having to crap, somebody's knocking on the door. ok i'm back;. now where was i. ah yes my toes probably have frost bite now i could get up and turn up the thermostat but then i start sweating profusely and that's definitely no good. it's been very hard for me to meet people in my dorm so far. i'm in the new dorm, san jacinto, and it's like a hotel. since everyone has their own bathrooms no one really has a chance to mingle, because they're always going somewhere. everyone seems like they're on a mission and they'll kill you if you get in their way. i'm not exactly the most outgoing guy in the world, so let me tell you it's more than intimidating. i had such a close, great group of friends in high school that i could tell anything to. and they felt the exact same way. now, i have no one to talk to except a few of my friends that came here. the problem with that is, i just know too many people here, so there's always someone to hang out with, we just don't get new people to hang out with. and it's also kind of pointless if you sit down and think about it. because the odds are, if you see someone somewhere and introduce yourself to them, you very well may never even see them again. i mean, how much does that suck. ooh this is my favorite part of the song. shine on you crazy diamonds. wow, that just made me think of band banquet from last year and i have absolutely no idea why. unless it's because my date was wearing a gold sequine dress and was definitely shining. yeah, that's prolly it. oh lord my hands are tired. i'm so out of shape. i've definitely lost like 20 pounds of muscle over the summer. and now, everyone here is huge. i was big back in high school, but comparatively, i'm a stinkin shrimp. and i really don't have any particular skill at any sport. i played soccer in high school, but i played goalie and i hate it now. i'm average at any sport but i don't really excel at anything in particular so i'm at a decided disadvantage.

"ow. i just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. i bump intot stuff a lot. i think that it's because i don't pay much attention or maybe because i'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about the wall in front of me. i ramble a lot too and i don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. i've told the people at the management place and i don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and i'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if i don't like having the lights on? what if i'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way i can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing i'm not like that. i don't type as well as i wish i did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. i forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, i hope it's not overdue. i already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when i told him i scratched the car? it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when i messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and i don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if i ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when i know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because i have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. i don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and i don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. i like sharing my opinion. i even like it when people get mad or offended. i don't know why, i just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. i can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid i thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what i think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that i think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but i would never tell her that, and i certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. i think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because i only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if i can't talk to you i don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, i'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be evil, god forbid. god forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. i hate stupid people. i'm sorry, i'm a mean person. i don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. i hate when people ask me how i like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, i hate asking people stuff like that so i don't and i expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that i hate that. they don't know me there's no way they could know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. i am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. i wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do i mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. i don't think i have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then i feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. i think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up ",1,-0.222044 0.604996 -0.417213 0.441007 1.291645 -0.580302 -0.382782 -0.31002 -0.54071 1.670185 -0.169181 -0.240538 -1.760184 -0.725304 -0.913621 0.0 -0.04277 0.978821 -0.736692 -0.650699 -0.952496 2.353076 2.56978 0.780552 0.680906 -0.92789 -1.909818 -0.707649 2.151805 0.67738 1.460503 0.444875 2.415764 0.103711 3.616045 -0.65336 0.429821 1.103394 0.383926 -0.315653 -0.348495 0.184577 0.757106 -0.254789 -0.649424 0.710283 -0.352274 2.597976 0.53071 2.778164 2.014278 -1.171807 -0.809988 -0.128384 -0.927928 -1.087799 -0.323748 -0.182676 -0.858505 -0.074778 -1.411387 -0.684874 0.88477 -0.496789 1.67688 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.099192 0.386754 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.272889 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.837053 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.614319 5.227687 4.013714 4.218695 4.390717 4.984981
well. how do i start? i suppose i'll just start by saying that i am very tired of school i don't even know why so soon i mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but i'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing i am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 9 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and i miss him so much the only bad thing is that i think that i'm hiding myself from the world because i feel safe enough with him that i block out the rest of the world and therefore i am not quite as social as i should be. but i'm really worried that i'm going to lose him and then where will i be? who will i have? oh well can't think of that right now. i'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. i don't quite know what will happen but i do know that he is very special to me and every guy i go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff i'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now i don't know what to do except for buy her medicine i'm a bad nurse oh wells i can't believe we have been in school for bout 2 weeks now. it feels like 2 months everything is moving by so slow i miss dallas i can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 2 weeks or so i hate it that i'm easily distracted when i start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and i start on my homework its already 12 and i'm pooped i need better study habits i'm currently a biology major. i don't even think that's what i'm going to follow through here i don't go out partying like most college students i think i should take advantage of my college years here but i really don't like the whole clubbing experience i'm full and i feel like vomiting. i think i ate too many chicken wings. oh wells i hate the computer i'm on the internet connection is really slow and i hate tying on a laptop computer. i'm use to the normal ones i still have a lot of reading to do i have to finish reading in this class and in biology. i hope i don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is?

"first of i would like to clear something up. yes you did pay for bally's but for the money you paid i wore walamrt and target clothes and payless shoes. i also hardly think that the $30 a month you paid for me equates to the hundreds you pay for andrew. second i paid for that fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at s&s. in no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. i did earn a lot of money this summer. i spent very little of it and saved most of it - so you wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. i don't think having a car is a sign of love- i think it is a sign of favoritism. that's what makes me cry and get really upset. the two main reason's andrew got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and dad obviously identifies with him more. nevermind that i try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. i guess maybe if i act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one i could get a little appreciation in this family. having a car here is imparactical and honestly, i don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. the damamge is done. my whole life i felt loved and i'm not saying i don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. i was very upset. not that i didn't mean what i wrote, but i could of said it in a kinder way. i had a really long talk about it with will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. the reason i get so upset is not because i want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. logically i know it means nothing, but i still hurt when i think about it. i'm really confused. i think i get emotional about it because i think it's so unfair, i can't do anything about it, and i get so mad i cry. another thing i have observed is i can't talk to dad about it. i don't know why i feel it necessary to ""protect him"" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. i guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that ""he couldn't afford it"" i can't even really talk about it with you; i have to write about it. i guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as i can remember. maybe i get sad about it because i don't understand why i feel this way and no one understands my feelings. i really meant it when i said i didn't know what could return me to the way i felt before the incident. and all the while i'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. i was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. here, no one loves me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that i was sure of at home. the car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why i'm upset about it. i know that objects don't measure love. it's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. i guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. this letter itself is really ironic in some way. i write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here i am up at midnight worrying about yours. well i'm going to bed now, i've got school and work tomorrow.

"so today has been one of the worst days ever. i found out that i didn't do that great on my biology exam 1. and i aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 1. i have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and i am still not done with it. i am hungry too. i haven't had dinner tonight. well not yet. so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now. this is crazy. i don't know what to write. its hard to write for 20 minute. it has only been 3 minute. this is crazy. i wonder how long i will get to use this computer. oh, i don't know if my class code is right or not, but i think that's what it is. so we will see. i hope this is the right one. who knows. i have no idea what to write. i don't even know what i am suppose to write. i am really hungry. why wouldn't this prescreening survey thing work? this is very frustrating. i feel like crying now. oh gosh the thing worked and i want to get it over with but i can't stop writing. i wish i had started writing earlier. i think what i just wrote didn't make any sense. no i am pretty sure it didn't make any sense. i think it doesn't matter. i realized that u think faster then you type. well at least i do. may be because i type slow. but who knows. i think everyone thinks faster then they type. anyways, so i want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but i can't. so i wonder what liz is doing this weekend. i have to study this weekend , because i am really behind. i make a lot of typing error. i have to improve my typing. i want to go to jcl and eat. then again i don't want to go by myself. i wonder if kristi would come. she probably would. liz needs to come get her book. i kind of feel obligated, but i don't want to call. it's her book and she should care for it. she should call me. besides no one ever calls me other than kristi. liz is a very nice girl and i want to be good friend with her, but she is always too busy with her high school friends. they are nice too. why is it only 11 minute. it needs to be 20 minute already. i wonder what annette wrote for her writing assignment. ok so this is not a great assignment. i mean its very simple. it's very easy, but it is kind of annoying. it's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself. i mean you are writing for the class. who knows. this is getting old. actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast. ashley was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies. now that's crazy. well now i am hungry again. this is not great. this is actually kind of annoying. i think i wrote this line twice. i am not sure. like the way i am not sure about my class code. i know i am right but its kind of hard to agree with it. ok so i don't make any sense again. see i am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy. i know he is not going to read this but what if he does? he is going to think i am idiot. why am i like this? i don't get it. no i am really annoying. i can tell. but oh well. i am who i am. people should deal with it. see now i don't make sense again i don't even know why i thought about those stuff. and wrote it here. i can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating. except that there is nothing to cheat about. you will be cheating yourself. yay. only two minutes left. no it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast. i need to stop chatting on the internet. i can't even write a sentence properly. internet does no good to you. well at least not to me. ok i guess this is it then. only 30 sec left. yay. i guess i will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one. this is crazy. but ik ",0,-0.130656 -0.009204 0.868048 -0.153192 0.795919 0.12408 -1.447737 -0.837444 -1.160969 0.435736 -0.25714 -0.155712 -1.453169 0.041901 -1.541138 0.0 -0.04277 0.541059 0.03835 -0.590707 -0.11861 1.446469 -0.188267 1.866212 1.221461 -1.936527 -1.346578 0.445067 0.150754 0.318745 -0.496653 -0.546635 -0.109892 -0.906028 0.923834 -0.786905 1.445398 -0.239329 1.328253 1.258295 -0.062579 -0.637017 -0.38449 0.249601 -0.326278 0.278017 0.478885 -0.446211 -0.341551 0.050521 -0.914844 0.215348 -0.531926 2.502716 0.120458 -1.742494 -0.50382 -0.954251 -0.478125 -0.468617 -0.444953 -0.564623 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.841557 -0.745381 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.102689 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.311793 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.68189 4.974041 4.080233 4.506785 4.909016 4.300895
"at this moment i am worried about completing this assignment. the main cause of my concern is that i am using a friend's computer. i do not own a computer and therefore it is very difficult to have access to class notes and homework assignments. i have never really dealt much with computers, so i am not very familiar with this type of technology. i have tried various times to seek help in a public librar, but i was unaware that a long process of aquiring an account and finding a payment plan (if i want to print) was required. this is especially hard for me because many of my classes offer class information on the web. now proceeding to my next concern, tomorrow i have a major french exam. after finishing this assignment i must hurry to my apartment and eat lunch, then return to school. i have no idea what i will eat for lunch, but i must eat at home. last weekend my parents came down from lufkin to visit me. they swore that i had lost some pounds and that i must not be eating healthy. my parents worry about my health very much. being from a hispanic background, education is not of importance. my father threatened to take my out of school if i did not start taking care of my health and house duties. my father believes that a woman's future is in the kitchen. he never realy supported me in my college education. in his own words, he didn't think i ""would make it in the real world"". my mother begged me to stay close to home and attend a community college. i refused because i am very ambitious and much of a dreamer. i wanted to attend a well-known university (ut) and nowhere else. i worked hard for 12 years to get this far. i did it with very few support from my parents . i encouraged myself to achieve everything i have. perhaps it is better this way because my parents let me become independant and able to have my own dreams. they knew that if i achieved all my dreams, it would be because only i worked for it. knowing that you made it almost alone gives a sense of immense satisfaction and self-worth.

" well here i sit at college and its kind of weird. in the next room there is music playing which i like. it makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that i went to. it was in good ole tennesee, and i was occumpanied by my cousin. now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending memphis university. she now lives in hawaii, what a tough life. my room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. i always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. actually it is quite organized. i have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as i have grown older i have realized that indeed i do enjoy some sense of organization. my roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that i have. coming from midland, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from midland. a friend away from home you could say. my connection in the bussiness. . haha, i didnt always live there though, i came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but i do remember that it was right before i entered high school and it was still a major adjustment. i went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. my high school that is. now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. that is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than i could have imagined on that friday night. nothing could go right. i miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. you never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. i have not written much lately, and i know that i should have been writing every day. i once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. that and reading, but i know that i will have no shortage of reading this year. i have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. i enjoy reading. i guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. when your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. you think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. inspire or say something meaningful. its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. with so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. you can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. you have to find the median. the happy place you could say. not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. you can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. you have to make it happen. as clich'e as it sounds, its true. in the words of mick jagger and the stones, you can't always get what you want. . you could say that they truly are wise old men. you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. amen brother. spoken by a true poet. i have always liked comedy in my writing. not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. i mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. if they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. it was a wasted tree. often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. i by no means claim to be a great writer nor do i claim to make people laugh, i am simply claiming that i like to laugh as i read. i enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. if it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. it is a shame that i do not write as much as i used to. the ideas are there, i just have not gotten them out yet. they will be there, it will just take time. i guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. my memory is not the greatest right now, at 19 years old. when i hit seventy or beyond, i can't wait until i have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. .

"you would think that by now there would be no pain. ha. also on my mind is the extensive amount of homework that i have to do this evening. i am also very hungry. what am i going to eat? double-daves sounds good. or what about chinese? god my teeth hurt. i should've grabbed the advil when leaving the house this morning. bummer. i would hate to spend another 5 dollars on another bottle but i don't know if i can go all day without it. i am also concerned with the fact that i just did an hour of pretesting stuff and its not connecting with the server. that could be a problem. ill have to ask about that today in class. it did take almost as hour. i would hate for that to be wasted time. this paper i have to write this evening is really stressing me out. john winthrop and the puritan dilemma. what a dilemma. actually it is rather interesting the way people thought back in that day. things have certainly changed. gross- i just rubbed my tongue back to that far forbidden corner in my mouth and felt the stitches. ouch. this probing throb is driving me bananas. obviously. i keep losing my train of thought. how will i ever be able to concentrate on john winthrop. ill have to wait until i get home and pop a few advil. or a few hundred as i am feeling right now. just kidding. anyway another thing stressing me out is the fact that my car is in the shop again. i dropped it off this morning and its almost as if my life is in someone else's hands. at least my checking account is. ha, what checking account is more like it. ouch. my freaking teeth. i am going to have to break down and buy some more advil. that sucks. gosh it's almost 2:00 already. where does the time go? oh yea that pretesting thing and then trying to submit it. i have that it's not lost. maybe i should try and check somehow to see if i can send it through now. well its been twenty minutes. its time to go and get some advil and relieve my suffering. eckerd's is probably the least expensive. it kills me that i have to buy more of that. pain medication is not cheap. anyway enough bitching! lets go over to the pretesting website again.

"hello my name is joey michael kindred and i am a biology major. i plan to go to medicall school some day and i hope to become an orthopeodic surgeon. i did not become interested in orthopeodic surgery until i hurt my knee the first game of the football season my senior year in high school. i tore three ligaments and blew seventy percent of my cartilage in my left knee. i used to want to be an orthodontist until this injury but my interests changed with the surgey and all. school is very importtant to me although in high school i can honestly say that i did not try my hardest. i did weell enough to get by and to get into the university of texas but i did not do my best. from this point forward i strive to be the best that i can be in school and whatever i do so that i can get into a medical school, hopefully somewhere in texas. i grew up and lived most of my childhood in dallas texas and that is where my dad lives. i have a lot of friends that live there and i really like dallas. it holds a special place i my heart because of all of my experiences there. i moved to midland texas in the seventh grade and went to high school there at midland high. it is really neat to hear you talk about midland, dr. pennebaker, in our class. i had many great thigns happen to me while i was in midland and one of those things is my long term girlfriend of five years, katy kelly. she means the world to me and i hope i mean the world to her. she ended up at texas tech university but hopefully she is going to transfer to ut at the start of next school year for the fall of 2000. i am going to las vegas with her and her family in september for her birthday and i think that will be fun. it will be hot in las vegas and i look forward to seeing the beachboys and alannis morisette live at my hotel. i miss her terribly and i haven't seen her since the 20 of august. her mom and dad constantly send me email and little care packages and i hope someday i will marry this girl. i want to live somewhere in the country but somewhere that i don't have to drive that far to work. i want to live outside of a big city because i want to be a weell known doctor that people from all over teh country go to in order to get there bones fixed. that has always been a goal of mine and i plan to carry it out. i hope to have kids someday and raise them the same way my dad raised me because i can't complain. i grew up in a chrch going family and just came to really know the lord abotu two years ago. church is very important to me although i havent found a church here in austin that i am just wild about. i am a freshman yousee and i havenot been heree that long. that is my life story wrapped up in just a little bit of time but i guess that was my stream of conciousness because that is what i thought about when i was writing.

"the way i feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. i have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. to be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. currently i feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. i live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. the people at jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than i. i don't believe i am as happy about being in college for this reason. i love meeting new people. i find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends i left behind. i seem to dwell on the past lately. i go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. i work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. i many times dwell onthe question ""why do i not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. "" i guess part of the reason i feel this way is simply because as a child i was teased about being overweight. i guess i developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. i've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. it is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. personally i tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. i also worry excessively about my grades. i guess from reading what i wrote my biggest feeling'emotion is lonliness.

" i hate escalators. don't know why. i've always just hated them. or maybe i'm afraid of them too. my right foot feels really numb. and not comfortably numb like that pink floyd song. just numb. pink floyds ok, somewhere up there with verve pipe and nirvana. there's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me. he's wearing a fedora that's covering his eyes. he looks cool. fedoras are cool. i wonder why guys stopped wearing them. i mean they look cool, especially in those old film-noir movies like the big sleep. i have no freakin' idea what that movie was about. the plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was ok. some girls next to me are chattering'giggling. i hate it when people giggle that way. its annoying. i hope i don't giggle that way then i'd be annoyed with myself. i wonder what it would be like to be somebody else. i mean what if i was the guy resting back on that couch? would i be the same person in someonelse's body? or someone different. i wonder if a different body makes you be different. i wish i had my cd player with me. life sucks without it. then again, it'll suck either way so i guess the cd player doesn't make much of a difference. i'm humming the tune to something stupid. cute song. though what the hell was up with sinatra singing that with his daughter? freak. but he's a cool freak. the weather here is always so damn sunny. i don't like sunny weather, it gives me a sun burn. i like it when the sky's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain. that's my kind of scenery. always has been. don't know why. i'm yawning now, even though i'm not all that tired. i wonder what the girl next to me is thinking. she looks like she's in really deep thought. maybe she's thinking about lunch. no, lunch is over. dinner. yeah, maybe she's thinking about dinner. i can't wait until this week is over. what time is it? there's never a clock when i need one. life's inconveniences. i'm looking at my wrist, at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it. hope i'm not late to class. then again i was early to class the other day because i had my watch on upside down. my nails are too big, i need to cut them before i get a hangnail or something. my foots still numb, i wish the bloody thing would wake up since i've got a class to get to. i miss my friends back home. hell i even miss my paranoid, stark-raving-lunatic of a mother. how pathedic. . i need a new pinky ring, this ones all rusty and broken down but i'm too attached to it. its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway. hey fedora-guy just woke up. yeah, he's stretching his legs now. i wonder if my leg will ever move now. i wonder why people can't fly. i mean who wants cars and airplanes'jets when you can fly? that would be cool. i wish i could fly. but i wouldn't want wings, those would be too annoying to take care of. i also wish i could play the piano. but i guess desire never equals talent. reminds me of saliaree. amadeus was a great movie. great story. fedora-dude is gone now, some other guy has taken his seat. he's not wearing a hat, but its ok. this guy's got long eye-lashes and a pointy nose. pretty cool. i wonder if someday i'll wake up and everything was just one big nightmare. that would be great. i could start over. but knowing my luck, i'd just make the same mistakes.

"i am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, i have mono. soon i will find out whether or not i have strep throat. in fact , i need to call the medical center hotline later, although i guess it really doesn't matter that much because i am already taking penicillin. last night i could not sleep at all i was in so much pain. i would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. but, then about an hour later i would wake up and wish i was dead, not literally, but i just wish the pain would go away. i can deal with feeling sick all the time because i know that will eventually go away. i have so much stuff i need to do still, but i never have the energy to do it. i miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, i guess that is part of growing up. texas plays rudgers this weekend here and i already have my tickets, i wonder what that whole day will be like. i also miss all of my friends from high school, but i got two letters 2 days ago. i always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. even when i was a little kid i would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. i was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and i argued all the time. but, now i seem to really miss them, i think because i am sick i miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when i was sick. i wonder how my brothers are doing, i haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. everything here at ut is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. the people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. i hope i can actually make good grades in my calculus class, which is really hard. i guess i need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. computers are really interesting. they seem like part of the ""system"" and red tape involved in everything. not that i don't appreciate or like technology, it just isn't personal at all. i need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why i think i miss my family, they were always there to talk to. i know i can graduate from college, but i sometimes wonder whether or not i really can. i also wonder about the many paths my life could take. will i be truly happy in the future? will somebody love me enough to marry me? will i ever find a person i want to marry. what job will i have, how much money will i make. will i be as successful as my dad? can i live up to all of the expectations of my family? sometimes i see answers to these questions, i don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination? i feel like time is passing and i am not really making an impact.

"it was very frustrating to get on to the web site. however, the weekends are fun. i get to see my friends that are not at this school. this weekend i went home to see one of my friends who signed with the kansas city royals. i also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. one goes to tcu and the other goes to tomball community college. he was supposed to go to georgia to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. now he is writing other colleges and the yale coach called him. if he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. i also got to see my boyfriend. he goes to baylor. he was my best friend first and now we are together. it is great. however, i miss him a lot. he is the sweetest guy i know. anyway, right now i am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. it is really a pain. i need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my ethernet card. it is not compatible with my laptop. i am right now in the school of business. however, i am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. my dad thinks this is a terrible idea. my mom thinks i should do what will make me happy. i guess i need to get as much information as i can about the type of jobs that i can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school i will have to complete. i will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. i really do not want to go here next year. i want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. i will probably stay in the state. i will probably go to a&m of baylor. oh well, i guess i have a while to decide.

"here i am sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts. i am thinking that i shouldn't worry about what to think. i am not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary, but then again i am no psychologist. whoa, change in thought. now i am thinking of england and of how i wish i could go there to see the sights and see a close friend who lives there. now i am sad because this reminds me of princess diana and of what a wonderful woman she was. i was truly saddened when i heard she died. she was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for a moment. she was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you. this sadness takes me to other places, i am now simultaneously thinking of a close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of aids. i am a christian and i have strong christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving a supposed loving god. sometimes i praise god for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why. i have always been a dreamer, setting my goals high, but sometimes i wonder if what i want to do with my life is right or if god wanted me to go off and become a minister. life is never simple but i just try to roll with the punches. a minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt. they try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out, but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much. at the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to a lesser degree of love then is possible. i want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly, but in reality i have been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again. whenever you go on a date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself. i think that is a huge crock of shit. i am a multi faceted person, i don't even know what being myself would be. is that the self that you express outwardly, where in my case i am jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very, very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring. sometimes i feel like i have all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give it to. i try not to dwell in these places for any significant amount of time. i think io like who i am, but its just that i really haven't figured that out completely yet. at first i didn't know what to write, but now i am glad we did this assignment. it is good to get your feelings out from inside when you don't want to tell anyone and you don't have a diary. bye-bye.

"although overall, i am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. i'm actually on my own. i can't believe it - for the first time, i won't have my parents to rely on everything for. i'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. and i think i'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. even though i've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. i don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. i still would've preferred going to the college i wanted to go to, columbia u. i guess i'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, i'll just have to accept it. right now it's late, almost midnight. i am tired and i have so much to say right now but i just can't get it all out. most of what i think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what i actually want to pursue in my education. do i really have the commitment to study medicine? what am i going to major in? i'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. a lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. right now my parents are preparing for their trip to india. they haven't been there in 2 years. i feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. somehow i feel my parents' families resent me because i was actually born in america. also, i don't really feel ""indian. "" i am american in the full sense of the word. that's been a huge conflict i've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. the indian community i have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which i dislike. so i find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. however, i find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because i act different. i don't always hang out with indian people. in fact, i rarely do. strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by me, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. i don't know why i can be so bitter about this subject. i guess i just resent the idea of the indian culture trying to shape my life. i am about me, not about being indian. ok now that i'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, i'm going to complain about something else. how about religion? i am very proud of the fact that i am a christian. however, my parents don't seem to believe i am religious because i do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. i am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. it's the same way with the indian church i used to go to. i left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. as long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. i couldn't stand it so i left for a better church. spiritually i am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. right now, my roommate is out partying and i'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, i don't really feel lonely. i actually like being by myself. with others sometimes i feel like i have to act like i'm someone else. alone, i can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but i feel like typing more. i wonder if people think i'm some kind of nerd or recluse. i hate when people assume that about me since i'm not a party person and i do well in school. i really am different from most people, and i like that about me. when i get married and have kids (if i even want to have kids), that's something important i want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. that's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and i don't care what other people think. maybe i'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think i have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. i really do have a lot of friends. basically i look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person i want to befriend. so as i'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, i have to express a couple feelings. i'm excited about my new beginning in life at ut. i'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. i know i am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, i think i must end this. ok no i wont, haha! i still have a little more to say. i am a night person. i don't know why. but i just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. i feel like i can do things i couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. i wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? i know i'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. i wonder how much less people think of me because i am fat. i am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- i'm not dieting because of what other people think. i know it's not healthy for me, and believe me, i intend to live a long healthy life, and i need to start. sometimes i feel i am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. i don't intend to be a statistic of the ""freshman 15. "" well, with all that said, i am ending this now.

"start. the question is how can i make a good grade in this class? most people are smarter than me so i have to try harder to make a better grade. i know nothing, that is all i know. i don't know what to say when i see a stranger so i do not speak. frustrated. confused. tired. lucky. healthy. homesick. lonely. but its all good ill be alright tomorrow right? fuck you big country you bitch. there are so many new people here its overwhelming. i am mute. i want to make friends but i do nothing. stupid. harmless. harmful. nice. relaxed. worked out. bored. nothing really to say to mom and dad just what i did today. can't talk about some of the other things because there is no need for them to be burdened by my troubles. but they would like to hear it anyways. maybe i will try talking to them. am i crazy? i hope so. its so much more fun to be crazy. like in catch22, which i just finished reading. its really interesting to mess with people the way yosarrian did. i miss paris. i love it and hate it but love it more than hate. everyone is connected to everything else. especially in paris. i don't know anything right? because i am from paris? i'm so sick and tired of people from houston, dallas, austin, san antonio trying to make me feel inferior and they know everything so much better than i do. but i come from a small town and know i know nothing. who is smarter now? i love the country. there is nothing like it. big city people are pop people. they are so one way and not another. all the cheerleaders dress like brittney, all the guys dress like backstreet boys or some rapper from the east coast they wish they could be like. in the country its all different. anything goes believe it or not. everyone listens to everything. everyone can dress however the hell they want to on any day and no one think differently. that's another thing that confuses me. i'm from the country and i listen to all kinds of music. everyone i meet is pretty much into one thing and thinks the other stuff is lesser quality until i put some stuff on and they say oh i like that now. but they know more than me. jester is like westgate. drugs are everywhere and easily obtained. you just got to know who to ask. i'm glad i ain't into that. i stick with some beer myself. its funny how beer is harder to get than drugs here and everywhere i've been. the government has their focus on the wrong areas. i don't know much about government because it was so boring to me in high school. i may not even vote in this election because i don't see a real point in it. someone else has narrowed down my options so evidently they got that far they can do the rest. i miss brother sid. it hurt me when i found out he had passed on but i didn't cry. i really liked listening to him speak in church. he had a real way with words and was very emotional. our new preacher is a lot different as was to be accepted but its still not the same. he tries to make things to complicated and show his intelligence when everyone knows you are suppose to preach on a 3rd grade level. but why is that? that's like saying hey you wont get very far in your spiritual education if you never get higher that the third grade. third grade was when i broke my ankle outside running and some black girls started laughing at me. i stayed in school the rest of the day and was tough you know, trying to act tough. i didn't cry the next year either when i really messed it up jumping on a trampoline. i cried when i couldn't play baseball though. that was when i was good at baseball. before i wanted to quit so bad and cried while i was playing. of course i had a lot of shit going on in my life then. adolescence can be a bitch. but i was lucky enough to make it through it and once i got out of my depression i haven't really been in one since. i get sad a lot and have notorious mood swings but nothing major. rosanne is a huge influence in my life. i've never heard anyone else say that. she's has a totally different approach to life. laugh at yourself in the mirror every morning. make fun of yourself before others do so they know it doesn't really bother you and they wont make fun of you for whatever. water. drink. wet. still thirsty after every drink. don't know why that is. can't get the taste of chips out of my mouth right now. taste always makes me hungry. but i've already ate so there is no need to now that i am full and don't need to eat. i wonder what lindsey is doing right now? i think i have figured her out. she likes to tell people what she thinks will sound good and never lives up to anything she tells me. but she's my friend still. my friends in paris have all moved away. i wonder what andrew is doing in arkansas right now. he just moved the other day i think cause of crazy ass aliece. she gets weirder and weirder everyday. like stevens roommate russell. that boy is strange. he thinks he is mr. badass and knows everything. i wonder if he knows he's a spaz. he said my car system sounded like shit. he's listened to good systems and mine is shit. first time anyone has ever told me that before. maybe its true but still i don't even know they guy that well and he's only heard one time but he knows. i'm stupid. my arms hurt. they need to be stretched. i wonder how long i've written for. my roommate likes to play videogames and turn the sound up loud. have some respect man. i don't do stuff like that to him. i'm glad everyone isn't like me. then id feel different. have you ever thought of life as a cartoon or wished you could do stuff in cartoons? it makes it much more interesting. it also makes me more creative i think. or crazier. but i like doing it anyways. i haven't had a square in 4 days now. haven't had a beer since i've been here. maybe i will but i don't really miss it. they were wrong when they said i couldn't have fun without beer. what were they thinking? what was i thinking. i wish i would meet a girl that meshed with me. but if only get my treated badly again. oh well i'm not going to change cause i know one day it'll get me the girl i've been looking for. finish ",0,0.340295 0.094725 0.328352 0.235628 0.797468 -0.380877 0.252856 -0.152049 0.081185 2.105649 -0.24128 0.456722 -1.269711 -0.128326 0.111733 0.0 -0.04277 0.691175 -0.529502 -0.664262 -0.737546 1.042989 0.826927 0.814575 -0.032677 -0.664256 -0.972951 -0.272086 1.751469 0.443005 0.833874 -1.05309 2.000506 0.009151 0.693167 1.99017 0.323453 0.113338 0.687116 -0.037026 -0.72593 -0.164953 -0.180255 1.127533 -0.545716 2.10369 -0.589637 1.149579 1.138487 1.224564 0.730163 -0.437746 0.537749 0.425632 -0.300077 -0.150681 -0.344004 -0.604591 -0.615861 0.344884 -1.101596 -0.106948 0.756947 0.380545 1.244693 -0.280398 -0.086094 1.207225 -1.086796 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.91002 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.332887 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.24378 4.640676 4.282697 4.273006 4.710767 5.24888
" i am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, austin. it is overwhelming right now solely because i don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. i enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. my goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. i am feeling a little homesick though, because i am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. i miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. i am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. everyone knows eachother and i sometimes feel alienated. i am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. which causes me to lose concentration at times. it is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. especially at night when they come running in all drunk. i smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging theta. my roommate and i just got through with rush and are excited about our new sorority. i know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. i am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. it is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. i realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that i will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. i love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. our room is all tidy and neat. i know my mom would be happy. i really love this city of austin. it is so fun and such a party place. it also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. i'm not all into this every night party life. don't get me wrong i love to party and all, but to a certain extent. i'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. you become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. one thing i want to do while at school here for the next 4 years is discover who i really am. when you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? i want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. i am contemplating on whether i want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. it seems like im always on the go here, too. there is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. as you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. i notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. my computer just froze for the longest time so for about 5 minutes i couldn't write. so i am going to start again, because for 5 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. it is making me very aggravated. so in case you know this i am still typing after the 20 min time period, because 5 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. well, i am hoping that i will learn my away around austin soon because this city is very confusing. i just want to have a notion of where everything is. i hate not knowing my way around places. well, i am going to end it now because i timed an extra 5 min on my clock and it is up. j m y ",0,0.083167 -1.327911 0.706373 -0.850965 -0.640345 0.836548 1.005827 0.658347 0.620624 0.163098 -0.162198 -0.309148 -0.478285 0.499524 0.690228 0.0 -0.04277 -0.834126 -0.393099 0.557143 -0.264716 0.571769 -1.184801 -0.640406 -0.624052 -0.048301 0.105744 -0.204479 1.126276 0.895889 0.560665 -0.457591 0.532464 1.058726 0.050706 0.665118 -0.411421 1.380561 -0.540482 -1.227624 -1.038726 -0.41863 2.559156 -1.565904 -1.429535 -1.04165 -0.228133 0.088942 -0.80215 -0.519555 0.793494 1.55384 -1.051906 0.255501 0.704684 1.365683 -0.340685 -0.353717 1.840144 -0.972367 0.116973 0.109546 -0.055219 0.414868 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.013431 -0.137788 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.347136 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.170251 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.749983 4.919631 4.481985 4.734415 4.814735 4.094053
"i guess the way i feel right now is overwhelmed. i just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own i wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. i am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. although i know this is a part of life i feel as thought i am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. at first i told myself that is just how i feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then i might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. i have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour i have talked to my friend back home. i guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. i can truly same that moving to austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who i was and what type of person i was, but here everyone thinks i am a nobody. i feel as thought i have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. i guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that i am here i have to build a new foundation to start from. i am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. now that we have started classes i am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. i think i just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then i will be fine. i do like challenges and that is why i came to this university but the challenges i expected are not the ones i am having trouble adjusting too. it is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off.

"i love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since i last wrote my entry. i have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. i had english today at 9 am and really enjoy it, i like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which i like also--more of a high school feel. it is my birthday tom. and i am not excited about it because i have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. all my friends are already talking about where to live next year and i am not sure why. they all say that things fill up so quickly. i got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, i guess i had assumed we would live together next year. college is so much money. i feel like at every corner i turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. i am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, i am doing some babysitting though. kids are my life, i do not know what i would do without them. i was thinking the other day, my dogs back in houston--do they know i am gone? it made me sad to think they have no clue if i am ok, i am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. my phone is ringing but i think i will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, i have gained a lot of weight and i can feel it, i am slower and get more tired quickly. i wonder how it will feel to 19! almost 20, i feel like just yesterday i was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times i miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but i miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. right now my friend connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. she is thumbelina, so cute. there is a vacuum going on in the background, i really need to shave my legs. and lay out. my brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, i miss him also but sometimes i wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. i want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. he already has two. i am a theta and i really like them. tonight i am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as i do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. my e mail is broken and i am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. they are so slow. now my friend has left the room, i feel like i can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and i am not hungry. i am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at acc and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, i think the tv show jerry springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. i love beanie babies, they are so cute, but i do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!! i love the summer and am sad it is almost over! my 20 minutes is up so bye bye.

"hello, i don't know why i feel that i have to greet you, but i do. and i don't know who ""you"" are, because i have never tried to communicate with myself. that is so strange to me because i should know me well, because i am me. so. a stream of conciousness, eh? lets begin with the first thing i look at: the keyboard. it is black, and the lettering is in white, capital letters. i know each of these letters by sound, and sight. how did i learn these? with out them i wouldn't even be here doing this. now i am hearing things. people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away, researching away. now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here. i don't know who they are, like how to adress them, that is. but they are here to help. and for some reason that makes me feel at ease. at ease from what? i don't know . i guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy. my existence in this world makes me feel like i need to be recognized, sensed, felt, heard, or loved. isn't that strange? why do i need to feel this way? i don't know. but that's how i feel. moving on- what is another sense? i've gone over what i am looking at, what i am hearing and what i am feeling. but feeling in an emotional sense, not physical. i could have said i am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard, but instead i chose to elaborate on my internal emotions, and that is not one of the five senses. isn't that strange? so that covers three out of five. what am i tasting right now? well, i don't know how to answer that. i don't know how to describe the taste of my mouth. and even if i was still eating, how could i explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana? the only thing i could say is that ""my mouth tastes like hot dog, fries and banana. "" but that isn't necessarily what it really does taste like right now. now it tastes like nothingness, i suppose. what does nothingness taste like? i could ramble off synonyms, such as void or empty space even. but that doesn't mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it. right? like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like. there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry. mmmm strawberries are delicious. that's all i would be able to say. and now i am actually craving a strwberry! even me typing the word, and the big capital way that i spelled ""craving"" makes me want it even more. i am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that i can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before i leave to go get some strawberries. it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but i have discipline. and that is what makes me different from everyone else. i have discipline. i won't leave now because my grade is so important to me. and its paying off, you know why? because i only have 30 more seconds to go!!! i am very happy now at the hought that i don't have to type any ",0,0.557745 -0.244235 1.307377 -1.143618 -0.475239 0.38691 0.177981 -0.118751 -0.050499 -0.306447 -0.213409 2.539634 -0.610555 -0.376923 0.222173 0.0 -0.04277 -0.574014 0.415788 -0.52278 0.297909 0.052563 -0.898897 -0.678983 -0.624052 0.248636 -0.635099 0.099728 -1.659584 -1.349243 -0.296481 0.139124 -0.929236 0.044767 -1.017959 -0.679977 1.710137 2.3785 1.238097 0.060477 -1.038726 -0.062182 -0.666334 4.293021 -0.327678 0.881826 4.141102 -0.448919 1.867738 -0.971873 0.09167 -1.170836 -0.94524 0.816279 -0.973026 -0.036188 -0.891105 1.225351 -0.7946 1.724718 -0.695698 -0.565937 -0.480161 -0.277379 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.016333 0.779248 0.092962 -0.23436 3.176769 0.484454 -0.091933 1.968979 0.054894 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.913112 4.707378 4.337462 4.688207 4.535531 4.362067

"i am running from something. from who i was and where i was. maybe not running from. maybe running to something. everything i see changes. my life is one constant storm, one sunset. i don't spend enough time thinking about who i am. i am attracted to things that are not always the best for me. i think i can fix them. i like to visit my past. sometimes it is nice to bask in something comfortable. i sit in your glow and warmth. i run to you thinking that you will wrap me in your arms offer me something stable. something that makes me feel like i know something about my life. i was thinking today as i was walking on campus that you are the only one i would like to run up to and kiss. then you come at me with your fists up and all i can do is shrivel and draw back. i loose the urge to hold you. for a minute. i wish i could shake you. i sometimes wish i could shake myself. just get out of my own life for a minute so i would get a new perspective. do you think i am wonderful? do you wish that i would let you love me? when i was running today i pounded out all of my aggression and all that i was left with was tears. do you ever have the feeling that anger is a mask for pain. i think i play that game a lot. hide what i feel. or maybe i don't ask. don't look inside my heart. too many challenges follow. i am happy though. proud of myself for the distance that i have walked and that i take another step every day. i wish you would stop me sometimes. grab my hand and beg me to say. tell me from your own mouth what your life is like with out me. admit to me that i am the light that causes you to have a shadow. you never admit things like that. too much pride to loose i guess. i let you fill me. i made you my home. then so much of what i thought we had and what i thought we were did not exist. very confusing. and painful to tell you and me the truth. i wish i had something beautiful to say. i wish i was the rain that washed down over the whole world. beautiful gray drops that just make you want to stay in your warm bed. they are comfort and beauty and a rare surprise. they can be gentle and subtle. or they can fall with a vengeance drench you make you remember things you want to forget. create a spectacle in the sky. lightening strikes my heart. i wish i was the lightening that struck your heart. then i remember that i am lucky. so many people never find what i have. the ability to love, be loved, lay beside someone. hold them, think them, feel them. i am lucky to have found people that will hold me with out making me pay them back, love me without asking when i will notice. with those people in mind i decide to get out of the life i live with you. focus on them. devote time to them. hold them in return for once. decide who i am and quit letting you define me. i think i will be happier that way. i think maybe it is time to let my light shine.

"i think college is going to be the best part of my life. coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where i'd fit in. ut has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that i think, i will have no problem finding someone like me. of course, right now, i'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. i really want to join a soroity and become active in as many hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. even though i only know a couple of people on campus, i feel more comfortable there than i ever did in high school. outside of school, things are good at home. i have all the love and support than i can ever ask for from my family. without them i don't know where i'd be. i love them very much. i don't know why i can't tell them that. i guess i'm just too stubborn. i also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. even though i didn't really want a boyfriend, i'm glad he's there. he brings a lot of fun to my life. i hope school doesn't take away my time for him. i know its going to though, ecspecially if i join all the organizations that i want. overall,i'm satisfied with everything. i know its going to be a long and hard four years, but i'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.

"this is my stream of consciousness writing for psychology class. i'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit o. k. i had a dream two nights ago and i was at some hollywood awards ceremony. this lady introduced me to kirstie allie as i was sitting at a table. i looked over, and it was not kirstie allie but andie mcdowell, some other actress. anyway, it was weird. then on the very next night after that dream, i was watching a movie on t. v. and she was in it. i rarely see her on t. v. and i was astonished. it is very relevant, because i am reading a book right now called the celestine prophecy. this book is very cool. it talks about some ancient manuscript found in peru that is going to change every human beings consciousness. it is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 20th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. it is amazing because i have been having many of these lately such as that dream. also, on the way over here i turned on my car, and i thought of this song by jewel. i turned the station and that song was on the radio. unbelievable, right? i don't think so, man,'. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. ok i finished a focus question for history class before i came here and i also watched seinfeld. it was the one where jerry picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. george makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on t. v. george's girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then kramer tells george alright i'm not gonna sit here and talk about seinfeld for 20 minutes. i am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright you are all just a bunch of hacks. lets get ready to rumble in the bronx joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. nietzche's theory on dionysus man let's call ourselves the doors man. like the doors in your mind, acid. aldous huxley. when the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. that was a line from oliver stones, the doors good flick. it is total irony how jim morrison has a poem where he says, did you have a good life when you died, enough to base the movie on. he must have known they would make a movie about him. strange days. i'm taking tai chi classes. that should be very beneficial to me. i must do well in school this semester. man that is a big deal to me wow i'm really looking forward to the ucla football game. it should be a good one. i really want a piece of glass you know. my grandmother died last week on the same night princess diana died. was that some kind of luck, or what. i want to die at a reasonable age. death, now there's something i could talk about nope let's see mi hermano no va a california para la funeral. neither am i. is that wrong, i don't think so. man let's just increase the peace i can't believe i just said that there is a reason to live. we are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in south america for the love of peirre. they are going to read my thing and go nuts man. who am i talking to. sometimes when i'm sitting alone i think as if someone were with me. this is a good thing, for the love of my family is always going to be there.

"life is ever changing. nothing remains the same yet, you keep everything with you. every good thing that has made you happy and every bad thing that has changed you in one-way or another. right now i miss him. i feel love and sorrow. lose for what we never found. why wasn't i the one. or instead, am i the one who he needs? i hate questions that keep me up at night. you tell yourself, ""go to sleep. you have a big day ahead of you"" but does your mind pay any attention to what your body needs? no, never. so, i find myself wondering what he is doing and what he is thinking. is he okay? not caring if he is with someone else, just wishing him happiness. i hate myself for being so nice. people use me and don't even bother to thank me for that. is that to much to ask, a simple ""thank you""? i am greatfull for lots of things. for my mother and father and grandmother. by the way i wish she were hear. sadness with a touch of happiness runs through my body as i think of her. as i think of when i was two years old and would help her clean the house. about all the days she made sure i went to school and did my homework. especially of the day she left us. the day she left me. i was running. i remember i wanted her and she couldn't say anything. all i wanted was to say ""thank you"" for all the love she showed me. i guess that is why i say thank you for everything now. i should have told her that she ment everything to me. well, i did, but i don't know if she heard me. it is because of her i am who i am today. not only that, it is because of her that i am here. the world should be a better place. not for anyone in particular. no, just everyone. people should be happy with who they are inside. if not, than it is difficult to reveal yourself to anyone. how many people do you know that became who they are or accomplished what they have by being true to themeselves? i don't know many. sure, i'm only 18, (well 19 next week) but life has not been easy to me either. when i think of my childhood i don't have fond memories. most people i know would easily go back to the days they had no worries as children. well, not i. i hated being a child. even then everyone took control of me. starting at the age of six my brother sexually abused me. can you imagine that? my own brother. sure, i forgave him, but he wasn't the last. i don't remember how many people messed with me as a child, i try my best not to think of that time-period. though i do remember that i wanted to be better a better person when i grew up. i wanted to leave and never return to the pain. now i am strong. stronger than what most percieve me to be. i love everyone despit the fact people are harmful. i trust everyone despite the fact people are decietful. most importantly, i am happy. though i do miss holding him:) ",1,-0.481088 0.827859 0.951351 0.847341 1.077846 -0.618542 -0.357129 -0.148268 -0.020102 -0.374607 -0.232107 0.605071 0.305644 1.773143 -0.553222 0.0 -0.04277 2.352591 0.418704 -0.232898 0.379048 3.630444 1.810036 2.352125 0.009638 -0.285886 -0.55291 -0.00746 2.120298 2.46879 2.630263 0.998112 0.415667 -0.415697 0.315541 0.662021 0.686301 0.113583 0.124556 0.440539 0.301985 -0.720661 1.108593 0.081924 -1.050712 0.957988 0.346253 3.148256 0.463091 3.456357 1.917488 0.008739 0.909755 0.381423 -0.700074 -1.794568 -1.170245 -0.954251 -1.722303 -0.240072 -0.399947 1.599922 -0.480161 1.184873 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.853014 0.251278 0.098197 -0.23436 1.343917 -0.37208 0.16862 2.044096 -0.730351 0.622799 0.22601 0.735674 5.43868 4.557426 4.179584 5.221179 4.947793
"my name is john davis but i go by richard davis. i don't know if you care but your class is really interesting. that is not me kissing butt. i don't kiss butt. thats gross. my life consists of my jeep, beer, and women. my girlfriend is sitting right behind me watching everything i type so of course i can't be honest with you. j'k my jeep requires a lot of my time because i am always upgrading it. new suspension, new tires, new axels, new transmission, new engine. all better than before and better than anything else. my jeep is my security. not that i am self consious or anything, in fact i am very cocky, but without my jeep i am not comfortable meeting new people. i want my first impression to show the amount of work and dedication i have towards my jeep. it's my baby. beer helps me get through the times when my jeep is frustrating me. it calms me down and allows me to think more fuzzy. i like that!!! i like chicks a lot. without chicks i don't know if i would want to work on my jeep. although i would have a lot more time to work on it. i want to be sucessful when i age, and not real worried about not reaching that goal, just because i know that i want it so bad that i can get it. but, i'm having a hard time thinking about my future because my life is so full in the present. i spend all my money on my jeep and all my time on chicks. but if i didnt have those i wouldnt care about my future. whether people think those are the wrong priorities or not, its going to make me reach my goal. which is the american dream. to live a happy life, and thats all that matters to me. p. s. i do like to take the easy way to that american dream.

"today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? it's only the 4th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. i stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. it's awful. i've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. i wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool i guess. i got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. i'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. this oatmeal cream pie is great, i'm so hungry because i haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. i hate when i don't know everything. well i don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. i hate when i can't understand something right away, probably because i know that means i have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. i swear that when i used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. i wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now i'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when i used to eat them years ago. who knows? or actually who cares. kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means i'm going to the chem. review at 5. it'll probably be really good for me so i shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. i can't believe that i'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but i kind of feel like i'm missing out on so much in san antonio, even though i'm not. i can't wait to get some good mexican food. it's been too long. what a horrible affect working at a mexican restaurant all summer had on me. oh well. the football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! i'm so excited, my first ut football games as a student in the student section. ha-ha. and actually i think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool. i saw something on austin's news talking about ordering the games on ppv. that's crazy. i really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and i can't watch them. like the away games for example. that'd be so cool if i could get tickets to the ou game. i hear that there's nothing like it, and i'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but i guess if all else fails i can order ir ppv for 40 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on abc or something. i actually called kenny today, after my first biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. i don't know why but for some reason i really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before i went down to san antonio this past weekend. it's cool i guess. since i'm here and he's there, but i don't know. i wish that we wouldn't of met, so that i wouldn't have to deal with it. but then again i don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. i wish that i could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that i wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. i like that boy. dang i just admitted it. i don't like him actually. i just don't know. i definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy ""karla"" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. sounds like a challenge. i'm pretty hungry for like some real food, i guess i'll go down to jcl in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and i'm exceptionally tired too. i ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and i don't think it even helped me that much since i barely got a b on the homework. man, i miss high school math classes. everything was definitely explained so much better, so yeah needless to say i'm pretty freaked out about that, i'm actually freaked out about all my classes. oh well.

"at this very moment i am tired and hot, i really don't like not having a computer at my house because it causes me to have to walk far in ordere to do my assignments that are assigned through the internet. in this heat i really hate to walk. if it was cooler outside i might not mind as much, but until then i will be sweating like a pig every time i have to come to the fac. on top of all other things i moved two hundred miles away from home and my boyfriend so i really have a constant sad feeling streaming through my mind. there are some things that i will never be able to forget and one is that my boyfirend is 200 hundred miles from me. i really wish there was some way that i would be able to still come to ut, but also have mt boyfriend here with me. the days just don't seem like normal days unless i am ablt to see my boyfreind everyday and talk to him whenever i want without having to worry about how much money i will be spending on a phone call. i had really great weekend with him, this labor day weekend. we sure did have a lot of fun. if only there was some way we could things like that every time we see each other. a felling of depression comes through me every time i think about him. i try to fight it off but i can never seem to forget about him for more than ten minutes. i a definitely in love with him. i never knew love could be so strong. i really can't seem to get him off my mind no matter how hard i try. some times it seems like i don't ever want him off my mind. i wish he was here with me right now then t would not be obbessing over him on my writing assignment. that seems a little strange, but oh well like i said it is impossible to get him out of my head. seems strange to be so in love only after 4 months. especially with a guy that i would not even give a chance until after five years. i wish there was something else i could have pop into my mind so i would not feel so sad. i like to change my thoughts or at least try to change my thoughts to think about something happy every once in a while so i won't always be in this sad mood. i use to always be happy, rarely in a sad mood, but since i moved from home without my parents and friends i cry every night i don't thik it is fair. i want to get use to austin and meet some people so that i can start a new group of friends here and will be one thing away from what is causing me to always be sad. i thought living with my sister would he,lp with the sadness but it really hasn't she is never aorund and i really don't like being alone or a long peroid of time so that just adds fear to the list of things i exparience daily since i have been living here.

"i mean, there were many questions about over eating. of course everyone wants to lose weight that is a given. and the thing about the spiders is just plan dumb. oh but my friend on the fourth floor asked me to go up and kill a lizard for her. when i went in to the room she was on top of a chair with a flashlight shinning at the lizard. it was hilarious. and it wasn't like the lizard was huge. she was just really really afraid. man, i have a lot of homework and studying to do. i came here in the summer and i always had reading to do and now it is like i have 3 times the work. it is very cold right now. my room always stays below 60. oh man, i woke up at 11:00am to the sound of someone drilling!! i was very upset. it lasted about an hour and a half. i have a lot of laundry to do. my clothes are all strung out on my floor. i wonder if anyone is going to read this besides the psychology department. i don't think any normal people would want to read this. you know it wasn't until this previous year that i learned how to spell psychology correctly. weird huh? i just never took the time to learn. my sister went and watched saving private ryan. she said that it wasn't any good and that she hated and the killing. and now she will have a test over it on monday. she said it was hard for her to pay attention. for her sake i hope she paid good enough attention that she passes it. i had the same english teacher that she has right now. i won't mention any names but she is a really hard teacher. she started out as a dean of students at sul and then she went to my old high school. she was really hard and expected a lot out of us. i found that i like the challenge. i think that someone just had a wreck. i'm sitting here typing and i heard screeches and then a bang. i heard that this morning, only it was a bigger bang. i didn't get up to look. i was very tired. i hope that everyone is okay. my room is very cold!!! i wonder why they set the thermostat so low. here it is in the summer and i'm sitting in my room with sweet pants and a long sleeve shirt on. i normally have on a sweater. you know, i wonder what everyone else will be typing about. i decided not to worry about capitalizing my words because the instructions stated to not worry about grammar or sentence structure, which is great because i'm not that good with grammar and sentence structure. i wish we didn't have to type for 20 minutes. i have been going for 13 minutes now. i hope that the next seven minutes go by fast. to whoever is reading this, how many have you read? i wonder if there are any interesting. i think that psychology could be interesting. i just don't like some professors. for example, in my exercise physiology class i have this proff that just kills the class. not literally, but it is a very interesting class and i have trouble staying awake. i wonder if i chose the right major. i mean i like physical therapy and all, but i think that i would rather be working with cancer patients. i wonder what people are writing on this thing. i wonder if someone is treating it like their own personal diary. i have four minutes now. after these four minutes are up i'm going swimming. no not really, i have to do homework. i have a big concert to go to tomorrow and i'm trying to finish all my studies. you know i use to never use the word studies but for some reason it just came to my head. i like to write papers like these, no grammar, no structure just typing. i like to type i can type over 70 wpm. i'm currently looking for a job. and so if the person reading this knows of any available positions that i might be good for, you just let me know. i have one more minute left and i plan on finishing at the time i am suppose to. i bet that some people don't type for twenty minutes. i could have typed for 10 minutes for all you know. for some reason at the beginning of this assignment i was thinking about things to type but not any more. obviously. well my time is up. peace out.

"well, i suppose i should think of a topic to write for 20 minutes. it is a mystery to what kind of issue or topic the professor wishes me to explore. i know he says to just type what i think, but the topic is so broad there are an infinite number of paths and possibilities to explore. what exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment. it can't be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 20 minutes. my mind currently draws a blank at what i should write about. perhaps my first impressions of college as a freshman? well so far, i think i'm still getting used to the fact that i am living on my own, and i do have a greater sense of independence from my parents. however, there are responsibilities i like and dislike having. wow, it's only been around 5 minutes since i started. i really doubt i am capable of typing about no specific topic for a whole 20 minutes. now i am thinking if i am required to type for the whole 20 minutes, or if i can simply hit the finish button when i have finished this stream of thought. earlier, i started to complete a few experiment requirements. the prescreening requirement was not available, which is kind of depressing since it seemed like an easy 1. 5 hr worth of experimental credit. i hope it becomes available later. now, my mind continues to draw a blank with nothing to write about. honestly, i'm watching tv while typing this assignment, hoping to pass the time a little faster. it doesn't seem to be helping much though. it's strange when you try to force yourself to type about anything, nothing comes out. not just nothing good, but absolutely nothing! well i'm nearing the 15 min mark, and i seem to have less and less to write. i wonder how long other people's assignments will be. perhaps most will be longer than mine, but maybe not. some soul must be just as stuck as i am.

"hi my name is brandi and i am writing this assignment, mainly cuz you told me too. right now i am really tired and worried about my grandfather who happens to be in the hospital right now. i feel stupid writing about absolutely nothing just what i think about and since that is what i was thinking that is what i typed. i am really wondering when this line is going to end cuz it is pretty darn long. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing at the university of atm right now. i wonder if he misses me or forgot about me. though i know that he didn't forget about me. i mean who would i am an unforgettable person. this apartment'dorm is so terribly hot. i haven't figured out how to work the air conditioner yet. i believe that it is broke, my room mate can't figure it out either. let's see i have wrote for about 5 whole minutes so far, and this is a lot harder than it sounds. let's see what can i do this weekend. hummmm. there is the football game, a party i was invited too, go home (which i don't see happening), go see my grandfather (which i am not real sure about doing), or study. i believe i will take options one, two, and four. i don't want to see my grandfather because i hate to be around sad situations. they depress me and i hate to feel sad or depressed. i figure i can make myself that way why put myself into that situation. i love my grandfather but i don't want to go there. there is also the fact that if i don't acknowledge it then it might not be true. that is the way i think. if i don't see it then it doesn't happen. illogical but it works for me. my friend just came over and i let her in she is now washing my dishes, she is one of my best friends and i have known her since kindergarten, but boy can we get on each others nerves. not kidding because we really do. we have gotten to be like sisters almost especially this past summer and we just were around each other too much. and when we argue it is usually over irrelevant things, or really really stupid things. we also argue over the race issue. she is black and i am white, that is one issue that can really tick me off. i don't understand how people can be so stupid and childish. why should we look at race instead of the people. that issue really makes me mad. i really have completely nothing to say at all. i did receive a letter well email from my boyfriend today and it really made me happy. he told me that he missed me. it had been awhile since i have seen him but hopefully he will be able to come see me this weekend on sunday since there is a stupid football game on saturday. i really miss him and wish he was coming here but it makes me happy when i hear from him and see him. i guess since i am a female one of the most lovable things i like to do is hug someone, but only at certain times. cuz when i am sad, it will make me cry in a heartbeat. kind of what happened yesterday. i told my room mate about my granddad and she gave me a hug and i wanted to just cry, but i hate to do that in front of people. lord have mercy it is hot. i am about to catch on flames i am soooooo hot. well i have typed for twenty minutes so i am leaving now. i sure am glad cause it is really hard to just wait until your mind has something to say. i mean when you aren't thinking about it you can think all day long but when you are trying to think of something to say you cant do it. never fails. happens to me every time.

"i don't know what to do with my boyfriend. i am so distracted by him and i should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in college. i don't really feel that great today. i really feel like taking a bath. it would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. i wonder eho the package is from that i got. it is really stupid that i won't be able to pick it up until tuesday. my room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. i miss my roommate already. maybe i should have gone home this weekend. oh, well i guess my weekend is going ok because i got to see both jared and eddie yesterday and that made me happy. i miss jared right now. i wish my siter was here. we would have so much fun. i heard that she already took over my room. i don't really know what i think about that. i don't know how i am going to get all my work done, i can't believe i slacked off sp much and i would have had all my stuff done already. oh well, i guess next time i will do better. i hope that i will be able to get my application to the texas spirits this week so i can start meeting people. maybe i should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. hopefully with the things i am attempting to join i will be able to meet some more peope. it is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. all my frinds from high school were pretty much people that i had been friends with since catholic grade school. making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many difference places. ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere i have been before. except for new york city, i guess. but i guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and i guess that is prety hard to comprehend. i wonder ho jennifer is at lsu. the last time i talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. i hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. so far, it seems like kristen and colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. i haven't talked to sarah at all , i hope she is doing ok. i wonder if she has met wes yet , i bet they would get along really well. this wirting is completely all over the place. i am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so i guess i can end my rambling.

" it amazes me that i have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet i wait to do it until the night before the deadline. i don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes i guess i do. i'm really tired. i stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. then i had to wake up at about seven. i don't even know why i woke up that early. we entered the draw for the ou football tickets and everyone i talked to said to get there early. so i wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. i was pretty irritated when i found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. i must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. i guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. i'm actually not as nervous as i expected to be. i came from a town of 2000, smaller than most people's high schools. everyone told me that i was going to be sad and cry a lot. suprisingly i haven't been upset once. sure i miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. i do miss my boyfriend. he's great. that was pretty hard. i cried more when i left him than my parents. don't really know what that means. i was just use to seeing him everyday and now i hardly get to talk to him. he's still great though. i hope it all works out okay. i know it will. what's meant to be is meant to be though. i've sort of learned the hard way that i can't decide my own fate, i've tried to change things but they still end up the way i worried they would, but they ended up okay. i guess he does know what he's doing. he's pretty good at it. yesterday was kind of hard. the september 11th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. i got to go to new york this summer. my mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. pretty nice gift. she and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. it was my middle sister leslie's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. she was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. it was real sad, but we forced her to go. we had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. it was truly amazing. in my dorm we have a connecting bath. it's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. it took my roomate and i a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. we've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. one of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom. wierd, but i'm glad we figured it out, it was really starting to get on my nerves. i've really been getting sick. i think i've been sick since i moved down here. i'm sure it's because i'm in a new setting and i don't sleep near as much as i should, but i guess i'll adjust. i called my doctor and he told me i needed orange juice, which wouldn't get me well but it would make me feel better , and some sleep. it's hard because i still use my old doctor. he's the only doctor i've ever had. i guess it's that comfort zone thing again. i've lived in the same town, on the same street, with the same neighbors, in the same house. i've had the same friends for eighteen years. it's sort of odd to be gone from everything. the coolest thing happened to me this past weekend. my boyfriend got me tickets to go to pat green so i went home. there was a get together before the concert so we went over to one of his friend's house. as i was walking in, this girl was coming out, she just looked at me and smiled, so naturally i smiled back. then she said, are you allison bruce? i was like yeah. she looked at me and said, i'm crystal. i was thinking okay?? then she said your best friend. she was my best friend from kindergarten to second grade. she had to move to alaska with her family. then she moved to a little town, lifeguarded in another town where she met her boy friend weston, who happens to be one of my friends cousins. it's such a small world. gary and weston hang out so he has known her for a while. it's so exciting.

"i really miss all of my people back home. i really miss kim i wish she would take me back. i miss having her around to hold me and make me feel happy. i really really miss being happy. i can't seem to do it on a regular basis without her. why did she break up with me. i still realy don't understand. i was very good to her. lacey said i was her favorite out of all of kims boyfriends. seems like that says something. but i guess not. were still broken up and i don't see that changing any time soon. excpet i wonder what that big long letter was going to be about. i find that very interesting. could she have written about how much she misses me and wants me back. who knows, hell, i may never know and thats the problem. i really want to know. i want her to be honest with me about everything that goes through her mind about me. i would love if she would just write down every thought she ever has about me and just tell me. that would make things so much easier for me. it may hurt sometimes, but at least i would know. that would make me feel a lot better. i really hope she writes me back to tell me what that letter said. it bothers me that i can't know. i wish she wouldnt have even told me that she had written that damn thing. now its going to be on my mind all the time. at least until she tells me what it said or at least what it was about. thats all i want to know. i want to know if it said she wanted to get me back, or if she never wanted to talk to me again. i think she still wants to talk to me cause i know she cares about me. lacey told me that, and i know that. but i just want to know what it said. and i want to know what kathryn was talking about when she said that brad and john said they were talking about how i stalked kim. when could i have done that?? i was out of town, so its pretty impossible that i could have stalked someone 800 miles away. i wonder if kim thinks that i stalk her. i don't know how she could think that. its really silly to think that someone would think that. but kathryn said that brad may have told her that just to make her happy. why would it make kathryn happy that i stalk kim, even though i don't. i guess cause now kathryn knows that someone hurt me as bad as i hurt them. oh well, forget that idea. kathryn and i are friends now so it shouldnt matter that i got hurt by kim. it should make kathryn sad when i am sad. i know it does cause she told me when she called me to see how i'm doing. so i know that brad was lying now. kim never thought i was stalking her. if she did why would she still talk to me. i just wish that when she talks to me she would say that she wants me back. just like in that damn song. ""when i go fishing for the words i am wishing you would say to me i'm really only praying that the words youll soon be saying might betray the way you feel about me"" yeah thats how it is for me. since i think she doesn't want me back yet. it would be such a good thing if she did. even though i would see her about once a month and we are 150 miles apart. oh well. cest la vie. i could deal with that just to know that she is committed to me. thats all i really want from her. i just want to know that she is committed to me. this sucks royal ass that shes probably out running around with hundereds of guys, and i'm here being miserable. if i ever found out that she was i would just go crazy. i wouldnt be able to deal with that at all. that would push me over the edge, like i'm not close enough already. even now that i'm here all i do is think about her. i've thought about her too much. i should be trying to find someone here that i can be like that with bt i really can't. i wouldnt mind meeting that vollyball player that alex was telling me about. she sounds really cool. if it was her that i saw today with that coach then shes really hot. and shes a christian too, so that would help me if she was. plus she lives a lot closer than kim or wendy or julie or erica. that would make things so much easier on me. i would really like to fall for this girl. then i could get my mind off of kim. if she doesn't come back to me, then i need to get my mind off her. but its too hard. i loved her too much. i still do. thats what sucks so much. but what can i do. not a thing in the world. i can love her all i want but if she doesn't love me then its all worthless. that bothers me to death. this is my first day of class and all i can think about is her. i liked my classes today. i have homework in every one of them. i should be thinking about that, but i'm still thinking about her. thank god my time is almost up on this thing. my wrists are getting tired. and my fingers too. this is really ridiculous. but i do see the point in it though. times up. bye ",1,-0.130918 0.6274 -0.647834 -0.082627 1.656183 -1.217639 -1.111948 -1.431632 -1.827718 1.265013 -0.214087 -0.437827 -2.155673 0.755587 -2.043048 0.0 -0.04277 2.191412 1.14999 -0.635295 1.042249 -0.431033 2.26596 -0.64637 -0.263113 -2.149113 -0.189075 -0.595888 -0.257087 -0.725258 1.260684 -1.200305 0.541115 -0.626744 -0.068536 2.169691 2.783586 0.406084 1.593964 3.234322 -0.656903 0.417801 0.399964 1.706206 -0.350679 3.442471 -0.273437 1.175902 2.223809 1.587051 -0.839884 -0.884054 0.986261 0.499305 0.15141 -0.346444 -0.494387 0.326211 -1.179988 2.371561 -0.916594 -0.992569 0.727925 0.354136 1.093321 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.816426 -0.734855 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.237264 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.045999 -0.658682 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.283517 5.095861 3.936883 4.800597 5.06787 5.180498
"so i'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. i have no real plans for tonight so i decided to do this assignment instead! it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that i'm going through right now and yes i am going through a lot of personal problems but i don't want to write about those because i've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and i sort of get along but i'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares i went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country i mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about i mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and i'm not having much but that's another story. i mean i don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, i personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and i haven't been able to oh well it's been 20 minutes and i'm tired ",1,2.80263 -1.707375 -0.887053 -0.974935 0.307265 -0.288948 0.922499 1.344592 1.047735 -1.211457 0.11903 0.713754 0.835776 -0.604475 0.662268 0.0 -0.04277 -0.970324 -1.560108 1.952083 -1.120355 0.147412 -0.704242 0.597036 1.439042 -1.571829 -0.021696 -0.307404 0.56975 0.672359 0.923986 -0.771886 -0.189674 -0.107847 0.067404 -0.388458 0.489501 1.433199 0.922177 -0.357318 -1.038726 0.830863 2.161777 -0.895876 -0.196206 -0.524991 -0.507571 1.323346 0.657462 0.436048 1.068487 -1.196096 -0.344651 -0.87189 -1.700474 -0.677717 -0.57154 0.265583 1.408238 0.563414 0.566922 -0.442538 -0.480161 7.109435 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.591315 -0.533939 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.078303 -0.012554 0.074519 -0.422267 1.058533 1.297316 0.10789 -0.837149 5.492085 3.941507 4.808935 4.3728 4.946998
" i feel like i am under a lot of stress right now at this time. all that i have been doing is wondering if i am going to make it through college alright. i am very hungry at this time. i do not know if i will get something to eat right after i am done with this assignment or if i will wait until i have done some other homework from another one of my classes. i know that i will have to get something very soon because i can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner. i smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until i give some food to it. i feel sort of tired at this point in the day. i have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon. that is sort of a good thing because i get a big break in the middle of the day, but i would rather get my school day over with early so that i could do homework at any time that i want to instead of being forced to do it right after class. the reason that i have a schedule that is this way is because i went to one of the last sessions of orientation and i did not get the times for the classes that i wanted. right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because i am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break. usually when i type i will take a lot of breaks and i will waste a lot of time that i should not be wasting. therefore, i guess that this is a beneficial assignment because it is teaching me something that i am not used to doing. there are many assingments that i am not used to doing that i have had to do for all of my classes. i get a lot of math homework, which is something that is completely different from high school. back in high school i really did not have that difficult of a time with the work that i was given. i feel now that i will have to work very hard to attain grades similar to my high school ones. the reason that i figure this is because i have talked to many people that used to go to the university of texas. some say it is not that hard, but the majority of the people that i talk to say that i will have to work my tail off if i want to be at the top. they have said that everyone is just as smart as me at this school. i feel that this fact is a good thing. i like to be challeged against others who are at the same level as me or above. i feel that if i work hard that i can do anything that my mind imagines. i think that all people should have that kind of confidence because everyone in this world is worth something. maaaannnn, i am really really really hungry because that food smells really good. i think that i am going to go and get something to eat after i finsh this assignment. i may have a burger or a few tacos or something. whatever i get to eat, i know that it will be delicious because my stomach is turning and wishing for something to be put in it right now. i forgot to tell myself that my left foot hurts a whole lot. yesterday i dropped a big can on the top of my foot and it swelled up a little bit and it still kind of hurts when i walk for a long time on it. i know that if i just gave it a little time to rest that it would probably be fine, but i have an active life and i really cannot do that.

" hi, my name is heather hughes. i am 18 years old. i am catholic, i like to play the piano, i miss my family, i miss my friends. i do have alot of friends that came to ut with me, but i didn't really hang out with them much in high school because i had a boyfriend and seemed to live a totally different life than they did. they were on the debate team, i was on the dance team, i joined every organization there was in high school because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great. all my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten percent of the class. my cell phone is ringing now. i really want to pick it up, but i think it's just my cousin so i'll leave it alone. it kind of gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my room number when i told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's long distance. i still have the same number from back home, so my mom can call for free. i had a bad dream the other night about my mom. i dreamt that she had done something really sweet for me, and i didn't appreciate it. all i could think about was being with my friends. when i came to orientation this summer, i hated it! i called my mom every 20 minutes telling her that i would rather go to texas tech or midland college, the community college in my hometown. but now that i'm here, i really like it. i don't miss her as much as i thought i would. i really miss my exboyfriend. i think i disliked orientation so much because we had just broken up. we had gone out all through high school, and he's at tech now. that's where i really wanted to go. i got in, and into the business school too, but i really wanted to be in the honors program. i guess i was a little conceited and believed that i was smarter than the average student at tech. anyway, i had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, i waited and waited. i received my letter from ut but it didn't mean anything to me, because i didn't know anything about this college, none of my friends were going here, and kit wouldn't be here. but my parents gave me a deadline and said i had to decide on a college by march 26 or something. so, i decided to come here. i think mostly because i was upset that tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and i also thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make it, surely kit and i can. well, prom rolled around about 2 to 3 weeks later, and kit made prom court. we were both amazed. because he made court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky football player. so the day of prom rolls around, and kit callls about 2 to say that the court got a limo. i thought great, now we don't have to worry about transportation! but then he said there wouldn't be enough room for the dates, just the court. so i asked him, am i suppossed to go to prom alone? and he told me to have my parents drive me! i was so upset becuase later on i found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or not, and kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. i don't know if i'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel. everytime i think of my prom, i'll always remember that. he also said during prom , that i had been acting weird ever since i choose ut. that made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had always said, do what's best for you. i didn't know that he thought what was best for me was him, and not a better education. i miss him so much. i tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. that it would be too hard to have a long distance relationship. i'm really disappointed in him, this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that i dispise them, and right before he left for tech he didn't tell me about it. a week later, i ran into his parents at best buy and his mother told me. each time he does something like this i vow this is the last time, i'm through with him, but i keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and i fall in love with his memory all over again. i wonder if he's dating anyone yet. i d ",0,-0.131815 0.544903 -0.597089 0.484693 0.295471 0.395431 -0.670818 0.012418 -0.022727 0.837121 -0.102131 -0.303522 -0.849217 0.161607 -0.822529 0.0 -0.04277 1.518251 0.635233 0.10701 0.699037 -0.567003 1.762212 -0.687436 -0.21744 -0.355742 -0.081907 -0.362947 -0.518364 -0.698106 -0.834265 0.127696 0.023992 0.352471 -0.804047 1.163869 -0.435963 0.709063 0.194883 -0.628383 -0.178449 -1.085571 -0.028603 0.435588 -1.18646 2.067594 -0.631578 1.352 1.922212 1.169097 -1.156565 -0.509758 3.63477 -2.003842 -0.737603 0.358024 0.731604 -0.954251 0.916025 0.097419 0.530428 -0.003092 -0.139922 -0.125978 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.622086 1.69133 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.399099 0.05307 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.210654 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.224459 4.899765 4.012736 4.979698 5.054844 4.740305
"how strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. the only sounds i hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. i hope i am not making too much noise. i don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. i can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. i wonder if my friend has arrived at dobie and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. how much time has passed. oh i still have four more minutes. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? i think he is working. should i go out with my friends tonight? no i'm going to stay home and read tonight. i miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. i wonder if my friends miss me as much as i miss them? life in austin is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. i think i'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that i have been accustomed to all my years living in houston. i had a routine in houston, which can not exist here.

" i'm sitting here, listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window, on my balcony at university towers and i'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud. a better question would be why couldn't they attach it to another outside wall that isn't in the middle of my balcony. i've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life. on the one hand, i adore it because i'm from chicago and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here. if there was no air conditioning and i had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets, which i've noticed an insane amount of, i'd flip out. why are there so many bums here? i don't really know what to do when i pass them because i feel really really bad and want to help, but it's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they do with the money and why aren't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place. i just don't understand why they are so attached to austin texas. true, it's an amazing city, much of the reason i am here attending this school. it has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by. it just has the worst heat i've ever experienced and i don't see why the bums won't save their change for a bus ticket and go 300 miles north so they don't sweat to death in the heat because they can't buy water and i'm sure that's not what they'd buy if they could buy anything and i really don't understand how their bodies are still living. which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming. it completely ruins the balcony. there is no other place i'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl i'm trying to hit on than the balcony with an incredible view, but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and i sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me. i think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly. i can't really say why, but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here. the tv's on, we just got digital cable and it's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he can't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 15 dollars a month for the playboy channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it's soft core. true the girls are prettier, but is it really worth it? i think not. he's a bastard. all he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour. the kid doesn't move, he's a;ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is, no man, but it's cool, it's cool. the only time he's not sitting there bothering me when i bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 3 on a week night and decides he's going to study the one night that i decide to try and get some real sleep. there are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which i am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. when i inquired why he was doing this and let him know that i actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was, no, it's cool man, it's cool, i won't keep you up. as if it's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on. the time is up and though i wish i could go on, which i easily could, i'd like to say one last time that my roomate's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening, gentle creek out!

"guess ill just have to wait. atleast i can get this out of the way then. i'm so tired, but i think its that coffee from mojo's thats keeping me up. i have that song stuck in my head by aliyah. ""i got what you want, i got what you need, can i get another shot, this time i going to make it hot"", oh well, enough of that. i finally get to see salima again!!!! this friday!!!!! i can't wait after forever, i'm so excited. anyways, my hands are getting tired from typing this much, and its only been 2 mins. i'm going to go crazy, no way i can write like this for 20 mins. oh no, this sucks. oh well, nothing i can do, i have to stay awake for my laundry anyways. atleast my roommate eric stopped snoring now. and finally that damn pretesting crap worked. i finally got the confirmation sheet, now i'm set to go do some experimenting. hope nothing messes up though, i don't want to end up like the nutty professor or like in flubber or anything. its probably going to be easy, like analyzing dreams and crap like that. oh well. guess i shouldnt call it crap, i mean this is psychology class, i can't make fun of it in a psychology paper. that doesn't even make sense, i'm goin crazy, because my hands are hurting!!!!! oh man, my eyes are closing, i'm fading fast, got to fight it, can't sleep, i can do it, then all i have to do is sleep in class tomorrow. oh, but i can't, i have . my ear itches. just scratched it. anyways, as i was saying. i have a damn quiz tomorrow, and the ta hasnt taught us anything. she's so sorry, i know more than her. but its those word problems that are messing me up. i can do the work just fine, just those word problems sound too complicated, and i get confused on what its asking me to do. oh well, hopefully there wont be any word problems to do. man this sucks. i'm bored, gloria is sleeping, so i can't chill in her room tonight and ""study"". salima is asleep, so i can't talk to her. kajal is being a bitch, so i don't want to talk to her even if she is awake. amar and ripal are both asleep, steve is probably awake, but he talks too much, so i don't want to chill with him. hopefully when i get off the computer gloria will have left me a voicemail telling me to come upstairs and chill with her. maybe she is awake, because i just called her and talked a little while ago. she said she was going to sleep, but oh well. she likes some other guy now, but thats ok, i already got what i wanted from her. but she's cool, we'll have other ""study"" sessions, i'm sure of it. she was pretty good though. oh well, can't get into that now, just in case somebody that shouldnt be reading this does. damn, not even 10 mins yet. i've never wrote this much so fast ever. its kind of cool, but weird at the same time. because none of it makes any sense and none of it flows, thats ok though, i guess thats the point of the assignment. now i'm wondering about what experiments i will be able to do. seems like fun. i can't wait. i'm excited because my check card came in the mail today. now tomorrow i have to go to the co-op and buy the solutions manual for calculus, because the ta doesn't know how to teach, and she's a aloser. i hope i'm typing everything fine. i'm trying to type with my eyes closed. lets open my eyes now and see how things went. hey, pretty good!!! anyways, i hope fauzia brings me that paper in class tomorrow about selling your notes and all, it'll help out, i mean, every little bit counts!!! well i'm almost done know. its been 12 mins. so not too much to go. this kind of sucks, meghan and angela are coming on friday, in the evening, and i'm leaving for back to dallas in the afternoon. hopefully i can stop by baylor on the way back from dallas and check out the dorm room. we'll see what happens. man, now that i'm thinking about angela, gloria did the same stuff to me that she did, but gloria went farther. oh well, she looks a lot better than angela anyways, so i guess its better that way. ok, enough of that. i'm just really hoping we can do that kind of stuff later on also. ok, enough, for reals this time. man, my contacts are sticking, and they're causing my eyes to shut. oh well, hopefully when i'm done with this, the clothes will be done. that way i can get em out, and go to sleep, i havent had good sleep since i moved here. i got to wake up all early. and besides that i'm always awake, never sleeping. but i guess missing sleep last night was worth it, after what happened. hehehehehe. oh well, ill miss sleep for that any night of the week. i don't care about sleep when that is concerned. i was all sore last night from working out too, but i'm not going to let that stop me. hellz nooooo!!!!! i'm still a bit sore, because we started working out on saturday. its starting to wear off, so i'm getting used to working out, i just hope we stick to working out everyday, because i need it. but i kind of like that sore feeling, because atleast then you know you're doing something, and that something is improving. man, this is loooonnnnnggg, but its ok, i doubt anybody will even read it. i guess its just like a completion grade. man its hard to have your words and all agree with me. don't just play with me like that. well actually, you can play with me anyway you want. oh good, only 2 more minutes than i get get ready to hit the sack. 1 minute!!!! this is weird its like a countdown for newyears, but hena didnt make a big deal about leaving. i wish salima understood more and didnt cry as much as. whoa, just opened my eyes real wide, now i can see, and i see that it has been over 20 mins, so i am done. bye bye ",0,-0.359708 -0.065355 -0.441157 0.048695 0.229678 0.000305 -0.627693 -0.927401 -0.672634 1.776211 -0.187496 -0.590446 -1.448827 -0.722339 -0.503551 0.0 -0.04277 -0.139164 -0.426232 0.193388 -0.39763 0.355625 -0.232168 -0.186089 1.921817 -1.17906 -0.899888 -0.501302 0.531815 0.594976 -0.475758 0.805452 0.144242 -0.659788 0.823639 -0.219772 -0.245641 -0.178784 -1.100692 -0.070695 0.981153 1.0835 -0.616079 0.497468 1.043608 0.341046 -0.189707 -0.57304 -0.290454 -0.026064 -0.303741 0.147336 0.314351 0.268243 -0.0677 -0.485115 -0.208293 -0.20161 0.032945 0.555938 -0.135409 0.185465 -0.480161 -0.745201 1.863327 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.191695 2.778182 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 2.844427 -0.210105 0.816319 0.749497 -0.451544 -0.408772 1.973566 5.10682 3.887555 4.665514 4.954597 4.630834
"going off to college for me was the chance for a new beginning, a fresh start. a makeover. all the things i disliked about myself could be fixed. or so i hoped. unfortunately, the thing about myself that i hate the most and has plagued me for so many years has managed to follow me here as well despite my efforts to escape it and start over. gerd. it hurts my relationships with others as well as myself physically. i thought that the gross puking that occurs after i eat too much would magically disappear when i became a healthy college student. but it hasn't and now my roommates are on to me. but i'm not supposed to know. instead i just get to imagine what awful things they are thinking of me and know that every time i put food in my mouth they think i'll throw it up. and they don't even know because they haven't even asked me about it. they just speculate and have apparently come to the conclusion that i'm bulimic. which i'm not. yes, i have a problem that i need to take control of. but i don't appreciate the way they're going about the whole thing. my roommate, who has known me for the past three years and is aware of my condition, could actually believe them. and she didn't even ask me. instead, she picks up the phone and calls my boyfriend. i'm going to see him tomorrow and i was so excited but now i have to deal with this. she has to go worrying him like this. but he won't worry. my loving, caring boyfriend will instead contemplate breaking up with me. he won't have anything to do with a bulimic girl and i'm not one. i really care about him. he's my best friend. i miss him so much. i just always fear that my problems will drive him away. i wish i were more confidant and more everything. but i can't help the way i feel or the way i am. and i really need him. he makes me so much happier and healthier. but i'm not as dependent as i sound. i really had no idea how much he meant to me until i left him. and i'm always afraid that he won't feel the same. i know that we'll break up eventually, but i hope he's right about us always being friends. that is so important to me. and maybe one day we'll find out that we're meant for each other. i do believe that there is one special person that i'm supposed to marry. god has a plan for my life. but i am totally clueless as to what it is. and you know i'll never know if i don't invest any time in him. i need to get my life in order the way i planned to the day i moved off to college.

"i am sitting in my dorm room listening to my roomate talk on the phone to her boyfriend. i have just finished studying and everything i have just read is all jumbled in my head. i am thinking about the weekend and what i am going to do because my roomate's sister is coming to stay with us. she is a junior and has just come out and said that she is depressed. i want to take her out and make sure she has a good time. however, i went to my chapter meeting tonight and they told us that this weekend we were having out pledge retreat and a field day on saturday. i have so much to study for and so much reading and i have to entertain a 16 year old girl. i don't know how i am going to get everything done. but i know that everything will work our because it always does. i am listening to little pieces of information about my roomates conversation and am very curious as to what is going on. it sounds very interesting. i am just thinking about everything that i need to do and all of the people i need to talk to. it is so difficult when you have to talk to all of your friends from your hometown and talk to your mother while trying to go to class, meetings, and everything else. it seems there are never enough hours in the day. my roomate is offering our room to a couple of her friends to come stay at our dorm this weekend. the girls are extremely annoying and i think i will have to find somewhere to stay. hopefully our retreat is overnight. it has been alright with my roomate and i. he were best friends in elementary school but things do change. i came in the other night and she was drunk and was trying on my clothes. it pissed me off but i can't say anything just because she is too nice. she left this weekend and went to san antonio and stayed with her boyfriend. they got a hotel room for the night. it was nice having the room all to myself. i have my entire schedule with a boy who i went to high school with. i was shocked at first but now it is very helpful. we can tell each other and remind each other about assignments and other things. i went to my fig class today and felt like i was back in the fifth grade. he assigned us a project where we have to create a shield. the usual what you like, a word that describes you, and other stuff to that nature. i finally talked to my ex-boyfriend today for the first time in a couple of weeks. we broke up because we were going to different colleges and he couldn't handle it. he is too much of a guy. everyone went home this weekend in my dorm and i was all alone. our room smells like chinese food because we can't take our trash out until thursday so until then it stinks. i still have not done an laundry yet because out dorn is out of special laundry cards. i need to go to the grocery store to buy more folders and drinks. i will probably leave and go with a girl who lives down my hall. i am excited that i don't have class tomorrow until 2:00. we have a theta mexican lunch tomorrow that i am taking my best friend to. everyone in my pledge class is so caught up with jenna bush. i almost think people joined it because she is in it. she is just like every other girl in that room with the exception that her father is the president of the united states. at our meeting tonight the secret service was there. that part if kind of cool to see them. it gives you a sense of security that you are protected as well. all of the girl in my pledge class are really nice. i met the sweetest girl down my hall. i am going to her grandmother's 75th birthday party in a couple of weeks somewhere near dallas with her. my computer keeps messing us and the pointer is going to the middle of the page. my suitemate just made popcorn and is offering it to us. it smells incredible.

"what's on my mind? right now i am in my friends room, one who i met this year. her names is si nae kim. the thoughts on my mind as i type are, ""mmm. this chocolate is so tasty"". i love chocolate and i choose to eat it as much as i want to until i come to the realization of how fat i am and how much fatter i am going to get if i continue to eat chocolate the way that i do. there's this thing that my friends and i call a train thought and this is when one thought leads to another. the thought about chocolate making me fat leads me to think about my eating habits in college. my mother warned me not to eat unhealthy foods, not to eat late at night, and not to snack during the day. that statement replays in my mind over and over again, every time i pick up something to eat. yikes! well, now i'm just thinking about how i can lose all this weight. should i go work out, jog, do aerobics, or should i just read my books. i am just so lazy that i can't ever seem to go workout. on tuesdays and thursdays i only have one class from 3:30 to 5pm. i spend the rest of the day either sleeping or attempting to do my homework. these activities don't take up my entire day and i do have time to workout. however, i am just too lazy. now the thought of how tired i am has just hit me. all day i have been reading, trying to catch up on my assignments that i have fallen behind on. my eyes are puffy and i can feel them starting to close on me. my body is giving out on me too. trying to right this paper, which i almost forgot about, is taking a lot of energy from me at this point. it's interesting to see exactly what's coming out of my mind so freely. i can't wait to read this after i'm completely done. hmm. i wonder if this paper is actually going to be graded in any academic point of view. i wonder how hard the test is going to be. i wonder if i really have to read all the chapters or if i can just rely on mr. pennebaker's lectures. i hope i don't fail psychology class. i hope that i pass with an a. wow, i feel like i'm just babbling now. will this paper get too long? my mind seems so boring up there. the things that are coming out on paper right now are so boring and useless, but this is what i was told to do. i'm trying really hard to type without stopping but it's hard. well, i have about five minutes left. what else is on my mind? should i go to my biology discussion class tomorrow? we didn't really do much the last time and it isn't mandatory. oh well. i wonder how my family is doing in houston. i wonder if my sister misses me. actually, i know that she misses me because she told me so. i wonder if i'm going to meet any one cute anytime soon. i wish i had a boyfriend, but then again, it is kind of fun being single. then i don't have to worry about being held down. this is college, a whole new world of opportunities to meet new people, to discover myself. wow, i'm so overwhelmed at the thought. i don't know if i am completely used to the whole college idea yet. oh my goodness, i met my exboyfriend today. what a small world. i thought that i would never see him again. oh, you probably don't want to hear about that stuff though. i wonder how my best friends are doing back at home. i miss them a lot. i feel like i left everything behind. i feel like i'm away at camp or a long retreat. i feel like that life almost never existed, that the whole thing was just a fantasy. i feel like i've been living here, in austin, for a really long time. wow, my thoughts are really random and still boring. what a boring life i lead. argh! i kind of want to go partying, but i'm afraid that i'll get addicted and then i'll eventually fail out of college. what a bright future. yeah right! i love dancing, i really regret not taking it in high school, but hopefully i won't make that same mistake again in college. college, where the doors open up to new adventures. this is the real deal, this is pretty much when everything counts. it's going to lead me to my future. well, my time is up now so ta ta!

"well, i'm supposed to write down any and everything i am feeling or thinking right now. the truth is i am totally stressed out today and can't wait to finish this assignment so i can go home and relax and enjoy my wonderful weekend ahead. i have many things to be stressed out about right now. first of school, i'm trying to get my gpa up so i'm having to do just perfect in anything i do for my classes to get into the nursing school. this is my 4th year at ut and you would think i would have my life together by now. although it's getting there, slowly but surely. to add to my stressful life is my exboyfriend of 2 years who just moved to california so that he can ""find himself"". whatever. but it's weird because i feel so much happier now that i am no longer with him. it's kind of like i'm a totally different person. i don't hang out with our usual crowd. it seems that i have changed for the better. also adding some stress into my life is all my expensive bills i have to pay. phone, electricity, rent, gas, food, beer, etc. one thing i am so grateful for is my wonderful family. i'm proud to say that my parents did a hell of a job raising my 14 year old sister, my 12 year old brother, and of course me the rookie 21 year old. i am so proud of them and their accomplishments. the reason i say this is because they had me, the first born, at a really young age (high school) and to see how well they are doing, unlike many others who start off on a bad foot. and then of course i have my wonderful grandparents who would do anything for any of their three grandchildren. especially me since i was the firstborn hahaha! well, i'm trying to think of what else i can tell you about myself in the remaining 10 minutes of this assignment. i will say that i do enjoy this class very much and want to acknowledge prof. pennebaker's excellent teaching skills. he makes the class so interesting you never want to miss his lectures. as a matter of fact, my exboyfriend to this class and he recommended i take it. well, i have 6 minutes and i'm trying to think of what else i can inform you on about my wonderful life. well, i'm from victoria, tx. (pop. 66,000) my family still resides there. it's funny to see my little brother going to the same junior high i did with all the same teachers. and i can't believe my sister is a freshman also. i remember those days. i wish i could go back to when life was so simple. but no, now it's time to grow up and see what god has planned for me. i can't wait. i pray that each day he's by my side and helping me in any and every way possible. guiding me to tomorrow. well, i guess my time is up. i think in the past 20 minutes you guys at the psychology dept. can figure out a little about me by what i just wrote. hopefully the data will be interesting. thank you once again for your time. hopefully i have written some interesting thoughts for you and i can't wait to see how my results turn out. or do i even get to????

" i really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. it's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so i guess there is not much we can do about it. when i listen to music, i like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but i parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. i also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. music helps me go to sleep also. i can never really fall asleep to it, but i will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. i've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. why is that? usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, i also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. i still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that i know they are ok, makes me feel better. even if i keep going back to the same part of the dream i try my best to get them out of danger. i have a very strong family background. when i was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect family and that nothing could ever go wrong. i always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. one of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. i don't think i could handle my mother calling me a name like that. i think i have a very good relationship with my mother but i know that i don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. i've noticed that i have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. i guess that is because i'm afraid to trust one person so much, but i don't think that is a bad thing. i just think that i'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. i guess that is because in junior high i had a group of friends that turned on me and i don't think i ever forgave them. i went my own way in high school but to this day i still think of their betrayel and i can still feel the pain from it. even though i haven't always had the best friends in the world, if i have a falling out with a friend i usually will make up with them later on in life. we might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. that also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. i've always been able to make friends with guys better than i have with girls, i really do not think i'm that much of a tomboy but i just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. my first year in college was the first time i think i made more girl friends but that also might be because i'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. i don't mind girls i just think they have more issues than guys. i also think it's really weird that i haven't found that one single person yet either. everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but i think i'll just let it happen when it happens. like even if i like one guy, there is almost always another one. i think i like like four guys right now and its terrible. one has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. he doesn't know i like him but his friends do, it's crazy. i think i've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. if a hot guy walks by i just turn to mush. i think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. he would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. he would also have to be a talker, i'm really into having good conversations. don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship i've been in has failed because of some communication issue and i think i've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. i think i am a good communicator fo. r the most part, i know i'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where i had two sisters and one brother i guess its no surprize. i've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. i can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and i think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what i do. not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. i've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. i work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me.

"i have never had an asignment like this before. it is hot in my dorm room. i always feel sweaty especially at night. it is difficult to sleep. now that we are a few weeks in to school i can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. the workload is quit large, and i never have enough time to do everything i need to do. actually right now i am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. i know i won't do one of those three. i probably won't eat lunch. even though i am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the ou game. the draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. if i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. i wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. we live in the same building and i still rarely see her. usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. i miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. we both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 30 min a day left for just talking to each other. hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. i live at dobie so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. i am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. i wonder if that matters. i don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. i am serously considering not going to my next class. i just want to eat lunch and take a nap. i just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. during the last lecture i fell asleep for about 10 minutes and woke up really confused. i have so much work i have to get done before friday. which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. my time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now.

"what am i thinking of right now? i am thinking of how different my life now is. it is hard to believe that almost 3 weeks ago i left the city to which i have known as home my entire life <houston> and moved to austin by myself, with really no friends, no family and no place to really call home here. but everyone loves austin, right, and i am really lucky to be here, right? i don't know but all i know is that i hope i made the right choice, my parents and friends, and family members really miss me and i miss them as well. i just really feel so lonely up here, i mean all i really do is study and watch television, not really being very social with that many people. and the weird thing is i am a very social person-- i mean in houston i had i think seven very clost friends, and now i have probably five okay friends that live in the same city as me, and who am i talking to when i am on the phone--my friends from houston, not austin. i think i am just in a period of adjustment right now, or at least i think and hope that i am. please do not let my college experience turn into this--my worst dream. why is it so hard for me to move on and make new best friends, it is not like i would forget about my friends from houston, i could be close to both sets of friends, and why is it that no people are out of there way friendly here, is it me? no it cannot be me, that is what i always seem to tell myself, that it is not me. gosh, i feel like i am having a conversation with myself right now, or that this an entry in my diary or journal or something! but this is truly how i feel at this very moment in time---scared, alone, and wishing that i were somewhere else. i am really not trying to whine or anything, but how am i supposed to feel? i am alone in a city, with nobody close, with whom i can communicate with. and these are supposed to be the best years of our lives, right? just checking because i plan to hold whoever first said it on that. other than that, everything is going great, i am keeping up with my classwork, studying every night, with no disturbances. why? because i have no friends up here, i realize that i am complaining an awful lot and really exaggerating when i say i have no friends. but like i said earlier: i am a very social person, and when i do not have caring people around me, i feel left out. and that just about ends the twenty minutes, i guess it's on to the next one---and yes, it does feel good to get this out in the open.

"of course i don't ever really cry--or at least not very often. i've been waiting for a really big cry since i moved here a month ago--but no tears. i left some of my best friends--though i have over a dozen friends here from my home town of college station--but not all of them and i left my house and my birth city and my parents and two of my dogs(the third one i brought with me). though i don't really know why i am writing this to the computer as if it will respond back or much less cares at all about my personal life. i suppose that i am just suppose to ramble and write what is in my head--yes i am so tired that i am repeating the directions for this assignment out loud to myself and i am actually so bored and tired as to write them down as part of my assignment. i suppose that that bit alright. it is now 1:28 am and that means that technically i cannot write again until after mid night tomorrow or today or whatever which is too bad because that would make my life easier to be able to do it tomorrow afternoon because i only have one class but i suppose i should stop bitching at the computer. because frankly it is a computer--of course now i am worried that this should have been some philosophical expression of how i, erin, tick as a human being--but now i am way to tired to rewrite this--if it won't send properly then i promise myself to do something deeper next time--for now, however, i'm done.

"at this particular moment i am considering whether or not i should have started this stream of consciousness thing or whether i should be cooking some food. since i'm pretty hungry, i'm not sure it was a good idea for me to have started this knowing that i have to keep typing for another 19 minutes or so. hopefully my stomach will hold out long enough. other than that i am wondering why you are having us do this assignment. is it like the experimental research that is required; are some of our samples going to be used in some psychological theory? or, is this for our benifit, will i come to some startling realizations about how my mind works that will totally change my life? well, tracking what i have written so far, it appears that my priorities are food, and other necessities. then i go on to question the purpose of this assignment. it appears that whoevers hierarchy idea was correct. i'm thinking mavlov, but i might be wrong. any way he said that once the basic needs were taken care of then the person should work on the higher needs such as love and peace and democracy and all that, but untill everyone can be secure in an environment with their needs provided for them they will not be to worried about the finer things in life or be able to attain them for that matter. for that matter. for that matter i don't even know what for that matter means. i guesse it means also. what a waste of words. wow i'm also noticing that i have stopped using propper pronunciation. cool. i guesse thats the assignment so who am i to argue hmmmm pronunciation is a waste of time a constriction gets in the way of us getting our thoughts onto a hyperlinked web page i suppose the brain doesn't think in pronunciation but it sure helps everyone else if the writings are organized in one particular manner anyway i don't really care about that too much i think the real reason for this assignment is so that we will get comfortable with this set up. i'm sure the real objective will be revealed in a later assssignment this is just getting us used to it and able to pour our thoughts over teh keyboard in a somewhat coherent if illogical way. why am i so interested in teh purpose? hmm. maby i should just do it and not care what teh purpose is maby ignorance is bliss maby this is a psychological evaluation by the fbi to determine if i am eligible to be a programmed assasin like mel gibson in conspiracy theory, ironic that was a consppiracy therory of my own coincidence ? i'll let whoever reads this thing, if anyone, decide. like i said before i need to make some food because i'm hungry i know i'm supposed to do this for 20 minutes but i wasn't really keeping tracki of time but since i type faster and think faster than the aaverage person i'm sure that i put enough stuff down to count yeah proba ly so proavba lj asdflja probably so.

 i am so happy i can't really explain how i feel just that i am feeling great. i know the reasons why i am so happy i just feel like telling everyone that i am so happy and i just want to smile a lot. i would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in austin that i don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. anyways i have had so many hard days these past days buti think that i am going to be okay. i don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. today i actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university i can make others see me. okay right now my feet hurt so much i did so much walking today just like the other days. the difference is that i got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. anyways i think i have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when i bought them. which is good because i usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. oh if i misspell a word i am so sorry but its just that when i am happy i can't really concentrate on spelling. i'll try not to make so many mistakes. i have gone back and captalized all the i's that weren't captalized. right about now i feel my brain fried of so much thinking. so i met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but i can't say who he is. besides that i am really happy i feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. all this happiness is thanks to god because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. so thank you so much jesus because without you i would not be were i am today and who i am. i know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how i feel and what i am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. i so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase i have her in my heart and in a dvd that my sister made for her. so any time i want to hear my mom's voice i just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. i wish i could describe this feeling and share it with every one but i can't. it's great! anyways my minutes are almost up but after this i am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. i usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. one teacher told me that if i wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them. ,1,0.265323 -0.512719 1.100754 -0.848629 -0.079841 0.132909 -1.251495 -1.190551 -0.436535 -0.43898 -0.047003 -0.590446 -0.56184 0.152704 -0.6398 0.0 -0.04277 0.32785 0.783391 -0.795527 0.61231 0.102603 0.101468 0.011362 1.988211 -0.992216 -1.715261 -0.561335 -0.226032 0.6804 2.744325 -1.01368 -1.053635 -0.906028 -1.017959 0.259804 1.278543 1.106174 0.930417 1.146578 -1.038726 0.264009 -1.172935 0.783815 -0.648723 0.390172 1.874035 0.097102 0.793972 0.072061 -0.123612 -0.531355 0.252935 1.018152 0.103755 -0.417113 0.49683 -0.954251 -0.855645 2.190494 -0.881886 -0.867268 0.612766 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.812252 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.144467 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.271939 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.272373 5.411383 3.73636 4.799681 4.84268 4.352028
"it stresses me . i this what i want to do or i am finishing something merely because i feel i have to. i think this is what i want my degree in but just maybe not what i want to do seriously. i am so much happier about my life at school already. i want to meet a good guy that i can hang out with and not worry about how i look and stupid stuff like that. i just hope it happens pretty soon. i love art now. there something so mysterious about it to me. what were they thinking? although i think some of it is sketchy as to call it some sort of meaningful piece but i guess it is to them. it is definitely one of those things left to the beholder. i am not sure if i buy into all this psychology stuff, it is a little hard to follow. we'll see. just out of curiosity, what are they going to be able to tell about me from this bit of blabber. i bet they read a lot of weird stuff. i am normal, i guess. sometimes i am a bit complicated but in an interesting way, of course. i do stress about that. if i am to complicated for the guys i am around at school. so many of them are just existing until their next beer. get a life. and a job. i think i am looking in the wrong place. maybe i am looking and that is my problem. it is kind of something that makes time pass. you know, waiting for the next guy, wondering what he'll be like, if you know him already, if he has a girlfriend. i am stressing that i will have to stay up too late tonight. couldn't stay awake in class, that bothers me. it is rude. i don't know what to say for 20 minutes. i probably won't go the whole time. i have a lot to do. i wonder what they think of me so far. honestly what i am thinking now is not always what is on my mind so forming some sort of a synopsis is unjust. just checked to see how much i had written. this is really boring, you know. i talk to myself all day. the last thing i wanted to do was write it down. i have to try to balance my spending every month. i have 3 weeks left and its not looking good, already. if only i had a job, i wouldn't feel so bad about asking for extra cash every month. but i don't and i do feel bad. i must go, this is driving me insane. i keep thinking about what i have to do.

" consious stream of thinking huh. i don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. these chicken taquitos sure are good. a lot of greese though. ya know, i really like musicals, but only ones from andrew loyd webber and ones from the late 19th century like gilbert and sullivan. speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. topsey turvey that is. i wish there had been more in there from the pirates of p. but it was still pretty good. i can't believe that i have a lecture to go to at 5 to 6:30. at least is isn't on friday. that would really suck. i should download some songs from the beatles. in fact, i should buy the yellow submarine on dvd. that would be a good movie to have. i wonder what movie i should go see this weekend. i haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. i wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. i'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. oh well. i need to write kim an e-mail. i haven't see her or kate in a really long time. they would probably appreciate that. i'll do that tonight after i finish reading the iliad. i need to read the rupublic. i meant to a year or two ago, but i never got around to it. i didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now i'm really getting into it. i don't know if i really want to bother learning guitar or not. i know it is never something that i would seriously persue, but still. at least i've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. i might as well, i see to have plenty of time on my hands. except for in the mornings. the past two mornings i've set my alarm early so i could wake up and get some reading done for class. too bad that both mornings i've overslept and yesterday i was late to physics. not that it really mattered. i could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. it's easier than what i took in high-school. my mom called me the other day. i was at starbucks, so i didn't really talk very long. i'll have to call her back tonight when i get in. i'm sure that they miss me. it doesn't feel all that different then when i was at home. i guess i might be homesick if i was going to school in like vermont or something like sara is, but i'm 3 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. i guess it helps also that i stay busy. i also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. i really want to go buy a phantom of the opera cd today. i'll see if they have it at barnes and noble although it will be an outrageous price. sarah brightman is a really good singer. it really helped that she was married to webber. that must have been a big career booster. it really doesn't see like i've written all that much. there is a lot more goig on in my head, but i just can't get it all out. some of the musicals that i really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. they just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made.

" im sitting in my room at the towers, and i have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. however i do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. and if i had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. yet i can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the towers has to be the food. the cooks here should go down in the guiness book of world records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. and everytime i go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. as i look around my room i can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. because he eats all of my food. i went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. i havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. this fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing i am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. but every once in a while i do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences i can say that tony, the guy with whom i share a room with, is a very nice person and i believe that we will get along very well. so far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. my other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. and campbell has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. yet the one guy that i am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate joey. its not that there is hostility between us its just that i try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time i get yet he just won't seem to respond. maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. because i know when i was in high school this new guy moved in from chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents. but the more time i spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. but the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk a whole lot. and i had to remind my mom that thats how people are in chicago, and just to give them time because they are really good people.

"this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio, texas. i went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell i'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. however, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished. i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order. at first when i went to the co-op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i didn't need about three of them. so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed, and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but i still managed to have a great time. i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home. i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. we went out to eat and to see a movie. we weren't sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. i can't wait for winter time. it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. one of the worst times i've ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and i smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. all together i would have to say that i'm very excited about this year, and i can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life.

"well, this assignment is interesting. i don't think i have ever attempted to write for 20 minutes straight. i wonder if i have adhd or add or if its just because i am a drummer. wow! i have only gone for a minute and i am already bored. um. i was watching the cowboy game and they won 20-17. vinyl did well but threw an interception. i think he will be good this year as lond as he doesn't get hurt. he has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses. speaking of defenses (i doubt this has any relation) but anyways i didn't make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing. i really wanted to make it and thought that i had a decent chance. maybe i gave myself too much credit. maybe i am not big enough or something. i wish i could have made it but i suppose that one was up to the coach and god. speaking of god (random again) i went to a really neat church last sunday. its name is glad tidings. it is an assembly of god church (although i am lutheran i think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons). i miss my old church though. my youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend. i am unsure if i should go home this weekend. i don't know. i think i will stay here because i really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend. i am really tired tonight but i suppose i will do my best to continue typing the entire 20 minutes. but along the thought of the laundry business. i have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend (was going to do this weekend but i think i can make it until then). it has been really hot lately. it was brutal last saturday trying to run in the morning. it was so humid. it eventually rained but not until after the practice. i have never been so sore in my life. i am still sore but i guess it doesn't matter seeing as i am not going to be playing for the team. i suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe i will try and keep in shape. i don't know though. we will see. well i am half-way there. i am still tired and i am finding this assignment very boring and i suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring. kind of sad i suppose. i wish i weren't so lonely tonight. just me and the tv. a horrible invention it is. ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals. but i suppose it helps many escape. i like to escape by playing video games. i think i might play one in a few minutes when i get done with this thing. but yaw. i really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on it but it is really fun and entertaining. i am still tired. still tired but only about 7 minutes to go! hurray! this makes me excited. i didn't have an antecedent before the ""this"" nor did i there but that was because i quoted the previous mistake. i wonder who just walked by my room. it sounded like two girls. i wonder if there really is a girl out there for me. probably. i hope so. one can only hope can't one? it's funny, i accidentally made a typo and said can't none which if one thought about it logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about it from a texas perspective it would have the opposite negative and depressing effect. i hope for the logical. i heard a papa john's commercial. i wonder how they can claim they have ""better ingredients, or better pizza?"" it is subjective i would think. there is another weather report on tv. i find it interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them (i usually just go with the flow). the flow of the easy river i guess. it is 11 o'clock. only a minute left. here's my chance to say something deep. i really can't think of anything but live the golden rule and you will find yourself a better person. love is all you need as paul said (the beatle of course. lol). that's it!

"it seems like everyone has gone home for labor day weekend. lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. we had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. i really don't normally like mashed potatoes but i always just get them anyway. a couple people started playing coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. the more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. this dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. at night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. they tend to yell and be extremely loud. our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. it would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. there are so many more months before the semester is over! i'm sure it will go quickly though. twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. i still have to go to wal-mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. i'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. i've been watching way too much of ""the real world"" in the past two days. they've been playing reruns nonstop since like wednesday. this week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because monday and wednesday are my busy days. i want to get out of the city next weekend. maybe i'll go visit some friends at texas state or go to the lake. i haven't been swimming in really long time. i remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than i remember swimming in my own pool. maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. the trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but i never once got stung. the lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because i'm over half way done. the game on saturday was really fun. once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. unt didn't do very well. i almost went there instead of ut just because its close to home and my sisters went there. on the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. i don't know why i bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when i have a computer sitting right in front of me. its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. i hear a lawnmower outside. i feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on labor day. my neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. i should trim my fingernails. they keep getting in the way while i'm typing. i haven't seem a movie since i came to austin. i don't even know where a movie theater is around here. better yet, i don't know what is playing right now. i haven't seen any previews either. someone must be sick because i keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. people go out way too much. i can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. i always want to wait for the weekend. i'm sure that will change shortly though. this has been a very long weekend. i think i'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.

"so here are twenty minutes of brian's thoughts. as i sit here, i am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. today i talked to a coworker about religion. he found out that i'm agnostic and proceeded to proselytize. i can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept jesus christ will go to hell. but at the same time, i poked several holes in the christian philosophy and in the bible. he wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. this epitomizes human ignorance. i have faith the chair i'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. this faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. yet he claims he has ""faith"" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. i can just as well assert via faith that there is a pink elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. i've never seen this elephant, but i know it's there. i have faith. it speaks to me through the elephant spirit. what the fuck is that all about? how can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? it is incomprehensible to me. i realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! who needs logic and reason anyway? and it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! it scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. it makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. and even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. i'm dumbfounded. it also amazes me how closedminded people can be. i'm gay. big deal. yet many people (though a few proportion in austin) perceive me as evil for it. my actions are vile and disgusting to them. never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. and don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. people have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to ""recruit. "" at the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, i can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. we even have al gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? of course!) j. and so i'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace christianity and oppose homosexuality. ugh. these are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! which brings up another point. i'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. the craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. but things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. i still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a ceo) as he. he. he. i can't stand it. but perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. in finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of procter and gamble and home depot, inc. out of some two dozen positions between the two companies one person was a woman! i can't stand it. i feel like i'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (keep in mind, i'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. hehe. ) and, not that i'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! it's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. with regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. this manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. and we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. with homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. and so on some level i'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will ""choose"" to be homosexual. then the species will die out! oh no! (i know per richard dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) anyway, i suppose that's my time for this week. tune in again next week for more ramblings from brian's ultraliberal mind.

"okay, here we go. i am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. i don't know how i can do this considering that i type pretty fast and also i am in the ugl and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that i type. oh well, no one seems to be listening. i am really tired right now and all i can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. it's only been one minute! i can't do this for that long. i have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm i had a fun time last night. i got in at 6 in the morning. if only my mother could see me now. that's the latest i've ever gotten in. am i typing loud? i don't want to do this anymore. i am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that i am typing. bored bored bored bored. i miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in barnes and noble i was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and i really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow i held it back. hell right now i want to cry. i really miss all of my dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. i guess it's inevitable, though. i mean i've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but i never thought that it really would be this hard. i'm living on my own. i am my own mother now. that's pretty damn scary! i think i'm responsible though. i've always been able to manage my time wisely. even my mom agrees with that. it's only been 3 minutes. or 4 maybe. i really like this guy i met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. i'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. i hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. i'm really paranoid right now. i don't want him to see that i'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks i'm stalking him anyway. i'm really not. i think i am inventing things in my head. i do that a lot. i can't believe i'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. well, hopefully not. i mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. yikes! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least i am assuming that it is. so, with that in mind i really am open to write whatever the hell i want to write. this is for my benefit, in essence. like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! i really like that guy. i hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe tuesday. hell, i'm sick of waiting around for this guy. i always do this. i cling on so fast to people i'm interested in even after just meeting them. it's like i have a onetrack mind and it's all i can think about. that's pretty scary, huh? wow i just scrolled up and i've written a lot. a lot of really boring stuff too. he probably won't call tomorrow. who am i kidding? i can't keep doing this to myself. it's really unhealthy. i just want to cry after realizing this. it's such a horrible thing. i am putting this guy up on a pedestal is that how you spell it? and like if he messes up just a little bit, then i think that he hates me and i'm just this horrible person. god i say the stupidest things around him sometimes. i'm so concerned with trying to impress him that i just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but i am again blowing it out of proportion. who am i kidding, i need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. like everyone i meet, i hold off on just for that rare chance that i might get to date this guy. i am a weird person. i am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. it feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. whoa that's scary. i love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. not really. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. i feel like each letter i type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. how did that go so fast? what did i write about? i can't even remember. i really don't want to look back at what i wrote either because i'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but i'm sure i will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, i envy your patience. until next time. that is all.

"as i write this paper i am still filled with the stress, but know gets much worse. i have been hired for a job, and i am still pondering if it is possible to handle both a job and school. i guess you can call it greed about money, but i need it to stay here. i am also thinking that this to easy. college is supposed to be hard, and yet my hardest class is my microeconomics. with all this stress i still have the one thought in my head. what if i was not born? would it be less stressful? this is not a suicide letter, but the thought of me not being born always enters my mind. is life nothing but work and school, or is it much more. i do not know i guess i am always thinking about the negative aspects of life. the world is not like peaches and cream. tonight is a busy night. i have to do my laundry, and do some reading. i guess i am psyching myself out. and yet i am alone in a city that is surrounded by my burden. i do not know what the point of writing this. i guess i need the grade, but even then i wish why i can not be truly happy about my life. to think that some where around the world somebody is happy, and it makes me sick to think about that. life is not fun and games it is a weary journey that must be gone through, but i can't rest my feet until i am done and gone.

"i am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. i can't really smell anything because i'm getting over a cold. i'm thinking about last night. my sorority had a party at antone's and my date just didn't show up. i've been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. either way he owes me big time. now i'm listening to the doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. i trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. i have a class today that i have to read for before 2 o'clock. i really don't feel like reading for that class, but i guess i have to. it's biology and i like the class, but i just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which i am not to excited about. my foot is starting to hurt because i was sitting on it weird, adn now it's asleep. i hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up i guess you would call it. this cd that i'm listening to has quite a mix on it. now we're listening to the beatles. it's not my cd or i would know what is on it. i wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. i mean there's no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. it's too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. i have a download capability on my computer but i don't use it all that often, so i doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. i understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the cd. i have no idea who this song playing is by. i still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, i really need to try and wash them off before i forget about it and go to class with them still on. i don't like the way they write exes on your hands. is not one hand enough? they really don't need to mark both of them. i don't even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. there would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as i was expecting it to be. well maybe if my date had showed up, it would've been more fun. i'm not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so i'm more excited about that. he is not coming in until much later though, i wish he could come earlier. i also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for lion hunt, another thing that the sorority throws. life is so hectic at college, i don't ahve time to really do anything. i don't know how some people do it. they can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. if i'm behind in a class it bothers me until i get it done. then after i sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. all i did yesterday afternoon was read. i'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally. but then next week, the cycle starts all over again. i guess that's why i feel like i'm never caught up completely. we're listening to school's out for summer"", i wish it was! but that won't happen for a very very long time. but i had fun this summer. i didn't have a job, so i got to do whatever i wanted. it was fun. i really need to straighten up my room, it's got clothes everywhere. they're all clean but thrown around from when i was trying to figure out what to wear last night. i need to go to the grocery store too, i'm out of bottled water and drinks. i need to get more hangers too. ok enough of this random writing, my 20 minutes are up.

 i'm really happy i started my workouts today even though i feel awful right now. i need to get back in the shape i was before the marathon. i don't really feel like going out tonight at all but i have to go because i promised my friends. i'm not really big into parties i think they are sort of stupid i'm always really uncomfortable because i don't really know that many people except the guys they go with and i feel really weird just following them around. oh well it doesn't really matter i guess everyone there is drunk anyways i really want to go home this weekend and see zach i really miss him a lot i wish we could have both gone to the same school but we couldn't. thanksgiving is really far away and i don't know if i can wait that long to see him. we have been friends so long it feels really weird not seeing him everyday there are some good things about being here i never have to see ross or trevor i hate those guys. i would like to lie and say they taught me something about myself balhaablaha but zach was right i never needed either or them. dating zach is so weird but being friends first makes it more special. i really miss sharon i can't believe she is going into the army in two days israel is so far away and i can't believe i won't see her for two more years. kayla is at texas state with nathan and says she loves it i hope her and blake get back together she just loves him so much i feel bad that she's sad about them breaking up with him and i don't really know what to tell her. i miss the basketball team so much i have pat and kellan here with me but zach and maury and matt and nathan and dotun are so far away i hate it i guess maury and zach aren't that far away dallas isn't that bad. its sad though i won't be able to go back and see ben and dipot and my brother play since my parents moved i'm sad i won't be able to go to reno with zach anymore but i guess he decided to stay home iwht me for christmas so andrew and dotun will go by themselves without us christmas is going to be so fun with him i know zach feels like he will never mean as much to me as ross but i feel the same way about amy i think we both know what we have is different but i really don't like talkinga bout it with him i would rather just ahave fun together like we always do we know what we are to each other and i don't think we need to keep talking about it. i'm over ross for good this time same with trevor and no matter how many times they ask me i won't get back together with them i don't think zach believes me though i don't konw what i can do to make him no so insecure about us i don't know whatever hell figure it out eventually. its hard to talk to him though i could never hurt him though i just know him to well everything about him we grew up together so i know all the things that hurt him and he knows all the things that hurt me so i don't know if i could ever accidentally hurt him or say anything that would make him sad because i know exactly what those things are. he knows those things about me too i think its better this way to know everything all the wounds a person has when you are with tthem there ar eno secrets between us because he was the person i always told me secrets to and he is still that person i go to so i don't understand why he thinks i will break up with him inever will he will have to break up with me because i refuse to hurt him i would never cheat on him eitheri love him too much and i respect him too much i think it is just awful when people cheat on each other i don't think its the worst thing you can do but it is still terrible you should care enough about the person to end it before you deliberatly hurt them that is just mean and selfish i don't think i could ever do that to anyone but especially to zach god i've tlaked about him way to much i think but who care nobody will probably ever read this i miss him a lot i think its weird what happened alst weekend going up to visit him will be awesome in two weeks i can't wait i miss him so much he is really starting to look like ben i ,1,-0.97602 0.509607 -0.044506 0.600921 1.568203 0.625436 -0.763833 -1.180645 -0.678153 0.734882 0.465084 -0.590446 -1.595131 -0.590971 -1.450865 0.0 -0.04277 1.88927 0.027364 1.624231 0.466263 -0.019036 2.404789 0.339225 -0.624052 -1.885814 -0.748317 -0.624411 1.271416 -0.295582 0.545321 -0.091574 2.193808 -0.25716 0.08495 3.285803 0.935444 -0.398873 2.2581 0.220779 0.291922 -0.834854 0.416662 0.528148 0.575693 0.111928 0.573602 1.783098 0.026805 2.593564 0.223907 -1.163482 -0.837225 0.877585 0.119827 -0.39328 -0.441285 -0.954251 0.559564 -0.263458 0.607448 -1.12961 0.221534 0.212593 -0.229283 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.780723 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.477761 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.830342 5.061408 4.181773 4.730888 4.539154 4.775505

"so school has been interesting so far. i've come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like, and i've surprised myself to find that it would be completely different. at the time, i have become increasingly known by a nickname that wasn't even self imposed, i've created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to. people love ""dat boi tony"" but hey. i guess i'm not too mad about it. it's good in the end, in some ways, and in some ways not. like for example, if i want people to know who i am, then they really do know who i am, and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way, but on the other hand, since people think they know who i am they won't bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who i am. really who am i anyway? can it be defined by a label or name? does it matter if i am anthony derrell williams, tony, or dat boi tony. because some people can remember my name at all. i guess in some facets it really is irrelevant, but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant. lol. it's like significance drives us, like a since of purpose, much like agent smith from the matrix, but that movie was flawed in itself. it had no purpose. it started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end, but that just didn't work. however quentin tarentino, did it right when i he made kill bill, it was a simple plot with a unique character development, and that was the important part. many people thought that it was the action, but it truly was the characters that made the movie. that's why vol. 2 is better than vol. 1, no matter what the next person tells you. sure vol. 1 was composed of the best action sequences since the old bruce lee days (who is still better than jackie chan and jet li), but the story itself is what should draw you. on another note, a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see, and now he's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care. the problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind, but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature. he can't take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself, the thinks he is fine as who he is. emo sux though. i had no formulated opinion about it until i seen what it is doing to him. he needs help. for real. the funniest part about it, is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting nietzsche. ""god is dead. "" which is a very interesting quote. a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion. if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason. they are a tool, if they inject reason and use logic to prove why god is alive. then they are less of one. the point is, that the religious texts, such as the koran, the bible, etc. were written by man (inspired by god), which means they are subject to flaws. inherently and maybe intentionally, if you could tell the people ""thus said the lord"" and you didn't want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish. then that's what you'd tell them. after all some people read from texts translated by shakespeare. but i digress. i as a christian would only have this much to say in return. if god is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed. and if he truly is god and did exist, death has no binding power. defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic. what is death, what is death to a man, what is death to a beast, what is death to a god. and then i would say. yes, god in the form of man (jesus) did die, for you and i. there's always a way to explain something in the logical realm, however some people are too closed minded to see even that. sometimes, philosophy, even pomo philosophy, can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe. and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory. that persons faith has become that much stronger. well. yester i went to a labor day cookout. and there were some fine ladies there. you never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you. that's the funny part about it all, i don't try that hard enough. i just wonder what other people's perception is of me. could i have had a chance with any of those girls, probably, but not likely. and this is where my reckoning begins. what are these girls looking for. attention? relationships? or just good sex? i could provide them with all 3, but hey there's only a small amount of me to go around. all jokes aside, with the truth being told, i really think attention is the centric thing that girls want. how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story, because girls are all so different. but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail. and i like to look at detail. that's why i think i might be staying single for a while. even as hard as that is in a place like ut austin.

"this is the first writing assignment i have had in college. i'm a little nervous. i don't know why i should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. i've never written in a stream of consciousness. i just lost my train of thought. i tend to do that. actually, i constantly go off on these tangents as i hold any conversation. it's quite annoying. but hey, it's me. it's about to rain outside. i was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. and professor pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""how the hell am i going to get home now?"". i laughed for a long time after that, but i was still thinking about the rain. after i ran out of class i noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. i also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. not one of them. i thought that was extremely odd. i have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. i'm very sleepy now. the rain tends to have that effect on me. i love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. but i do hate when it rains right before, or when i am about to go out. it's a hassle that i haven't had to deal with for a long time. i'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. i can't wait until winter either. that time of year makes me happy. i don't know why i keep referring to weather. i'm not one of those, ""it's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person.

"i really want to go swimming but i don't want to tell sylvia that i don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. i really want to go home this weekend. i know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with gera even after i haven't seen her for a while. maybe i just don't want to go out with him i think that i feel guilty for some strange reason and i can't get the courage to tell gera. this air conditioner is really bothering me. it makes so much noise and does not cool very much. i am so hungry. my roommate sucks. i don't know why i'm so mean. maybe i'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything i do. maybe she's just too smart and i feel stupid. i'm really hungry. i don't know how i'm going to get to eat if i go with sylvia and loni. i wonder if gera is calling me right at this moment. i wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. i think i'm making too much noise typing. i get the feeling that i'm disturbing everyone behind me. i can't believe loni. she just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. i wonder if her parents know the way she is. i still have one more question to do for economics and i don't really feel like reading. i learned that i should wait to be told what to read before i stress that stress test sylvia and i took was weird. i think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. i bet he thought i was weird. he could right away tell what was bothering sylvia. i know that manny really has sylvia thinking about him day and night. he's such a jerk. i can't believe what how could someone treat someone that way. maybe love is blind. i wonder why people around here are so free. i can't believe that girl i say two days ago. she was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. i assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. i wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. i had to turn around for a second. i think that i'm a nosy person. i often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. during lunch today i listened to two complete conversations. i could not believe the things that people talk about. why does my roommate have to be so selfish. i think that i want to make everyone healthy. i don't know why but i am so self conscience of the way i look. but i hear that is actually average in girls my age. i went all out on this diet until i lost up to 25 pounds and now i think that i am too skinny. but i say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do i gross myself out when i see my roommate eating horrible and then i see her change and i feel that i have to go workout. she gets offended very easily. i don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly.

"so i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing with this. just typing i guess. damn aim. no one ever wants to instant message me until i start doing something. there are so many times when i am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. the minute i start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. all that typing and its only been two minutes. i have no idea what to type. can your mind really go blank? i mean, i want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because i'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously i'm thinking about something because i am typing this stuff. so my mind really isn't blank then. so i guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. my roommate is funny. i keep picturing her when i walked in the door from class earlier. she was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. how someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. its looked so funny though. i should have took a picture. i'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. i am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. ah. the new real world is on tonight. i absolutely love watching that show. all the drama. its interesting to watch. its kind of sad though i think, the way people love to watch reality shows. i mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. they film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. can u imagine how much film ends up on the ""cutting room floor"" as they call it. all the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. if not made up completely at least embellished. and its all because of editing. birthday. someone on tv just said the word birthday. i'm so excited. my birthday is a week from tomorrow. yeah! but i also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. and i have no idea what to get them. actually what to get my boyfriend. my dad is easy. a gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy. my boyfriend. i don't know. he already has plenty of cologne (did i spell that right?) so i don't want to get him that. and i always buy him clothes. i want to get him something different this time but i have no idea what. and he is going to be 21. lucky. everyone is leaving me behind. i am the youngest of a lot of my friends. so now they can all go out to the bars. without me. so sad. i still have a whole year to go. bleh i hate waiting. bleh. is that a word? i type it a lot on aim. its my way to say yucky or boring or i don't know. i heard it from somewhere though. i can't remember where. ha-ha. my roommate is up. i wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face. because it fell off when i came in. bleh. i am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again. i think we should have a fall break. kind of like spring break. i need my rest. its only the third week of school and i'm already so exhausted. i need a break.

"9:55. 20 minutes. time? why did i wait so loong to do this? well i didnt know about it until thursday, but still, what happened friday? oh yeah, i slept i think or maybe not it seems so far away. i guess its worth waiting since i got to see elise. god i sometimes feel like we are in competition and i keep reminding myself that it can't be like that. of course this is texas where she is a goddess in her own right. i wonder why i have been denied the compliment of a man wanting to get physical since i've been here. elise i can kind of see because she is older and attractive but i would say our looks are on equal par although mine do need a little outside help to get there. maybe he just liked the smaller more natural look. god i need to loose weight. why did she think i didnt need makeup or to loose weight and why couldnt she tell i had? maybe she feels threatened like i do. i bet thats it, we both feel threatened because we are seeing each other in a new environment. i kind of want to skip the greek festivle because i am afraid. i'm afraid of being the odd one out. ok obviously i willl be like the only non greek. niko,. how i wish i was greek or smatter sometimes. i miss feeling loved. i miss feeling strong and powerful. although i do feel that way here sometimes. texas just isn't right for my balance i think. then again this is an emotional time of the month. but no i have been feeling a little off balance here most of the time. i gues sits good to face, but at the same time i just want to crawl back home to paris. will i always think of it as home i wonder. god, sometimes the future is hopless. dear god, why do i sometimes feel this desperate? i know there are a lot of things i have done wrong, but i also know that i have been forgiven. lord, i love you with all my heart and yearn for a way in which i can get to a church so that i can get the spiritual nourishment i need. i am starting to feel drained'. my father, jesus christ, please help me to help elise. help me to ease her fears and remind her that you are still waiting even though she feels like she is on empty. lord i pray for my father, that you would help him to fight off this cancer. christ jesus please forgive me for my weaklness this weekend. after vowing to quit and taking an oath in your name my human weakness alowed me to cave. please help remind me not to give up, that mistakes are just that nad that i neex to continue working towards being free from this drug. lord jesus, please remind me to turn to you and look upon you for strength because i know i don't have it. please give my sisters strengtjh and wisdom as well. help them to be happy and content in their new schools and to find good christian friends. lord just help my mom to dela with all of the stressesd of my sisters and my dads probably illnrss returning and her new job. lord please show her if it is not your will for he r to work and help emily and katie and rebecca not to feel the sudden decrease in time and attention thay may experience. lord i pray for jules. my heart is breaking for him because i love him so much. the thought of him tears me apart lord. i know that everything happens for a reason and that i am unable to see this reason but that it is somehow part off your plan. lord help me to recognize your plan for my life when i see it and to embrace it willingly as i believe i do now. lord please continue to work in the life of jules. help him to see that there is a god and that you are he. help him to understand how i know for certain and help him to experience this knowing and comunion that i am able to experience any time. give him peace lord jesus from whatever may torture his mind. help eric and kate to find the same things too. to be an instrument rather than a hinderance to him and let him serve in the same way for them. time? 10:16.

"i just got of the phone with my best friend lauren from home (potomac, md) and it was weird because she hasn't left for school yet - she is going to the university of pennsylvania - so when i talk to her we are coming from such different perspectives right now and it is really strange since we have always been so similar in everything before. we were talking about our other good friend meryl who is going to cornell and has been there for about the same amount of time that i have been here and she was saying how she has been talking to her everyday but that meryl is so happy and has so many friends and even a new boyfriend and i was saying how that is really weird and annoying because i honestly am pretty happy and having what i think is a fairly normal adjustment to college but i don't have like a real group of friends yet or anything and it isn't everything that i had hoped college would be yet, but i figure that i have only been here for two weeks. lauren was saying that what she thinks is so weird about it though is that meryl says that she goes out everynight and loves school and everything but she calls her everyday and i say that i am still adjusting etc and i don't even have time to talk to her everyday. i don't know, i just think that it is really annoying and try not to talk to meryl too much because it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me since things aren't going quite as well for me and it makes me feel sort of bitter towards her. tonight i went out to dinner with my friend katie who i met when i went on camp texas and i love. we went to the hula hut and it was really good because i had really been away from campus and the whole ut thing since i got here and i was sort of starting to feel like i was stuck in a bubble and out of touch with reality so it was good to get away for a little bit. plus, the food was really good and i hadn't had a real good meal since i got here either. it also made me more sure that i had made the right decision about going home for a the weekend of sept. 17-20 (for the jewish holiday) because i saw that it was good to be in car and get away and realized that it would definately be good for me to get away for a longer period of time. before i went to dinner tonight i was worried that i wouldn't want to go because i would feel like i was missing things here but now i see that i definately did make the right decision. also when i go home i am going to drive up to penn for the night to see lauren and when i was talking to her it sounded like she was really excited to see me so that is good too. i feel like i should be really stressed right now about schoolwork and everything with this being my first semester of college and my first time at a big, public school since i attended a small private high school but i honestly feel like i have less work then i did in high school and that it is easier - plus i am really staying on top of it. the only concern that i am having at all is the size of my classes (all of them have over 200 people in them) because i am used to being in classes with about 15 people in them and recieving a lot of focused attention from my teachers and although i am not concerned about this affecting my performance as i feel that i am completely capable on my own, i am worried i will be overlooked and just be a number in crowd - which i'm sure that i will be in a lot of my classes, at least for a while. so far though i like my classes at least and find them interesting and all of my professors do seem to be pretty interesting and approachable. i also rushed and am pledging a sorority which, even though i really like it and am happy that i did it is becoming more and more time consuming and i getting worried that i am going to have trouble completing everything that i need to do for that but i am sure that it will not be as tough as i am expecting. right now i am listening to a really good cd that lauren sent me that our friend dave made for me and it is so good because it is a mix that he made of all of these really good old songs plus a couple of good new ones. i have three minutes left to write now and i am really running out of things to say except that earlier i found a cricket or grasshopper or something in my room and it is really gross and i don't know how it got up here because i like on the 11th floor of dobie and there are no windows but it is totally gross and i am definately going to file a complaint and tell the front desk that i need an exterminator or something. well i think that my time is up now so bye.

"i guess right now i would be feeling on edge, or wary. it is on rare occassion that i have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. i worry about everything, though. i worry about this class. what will the tests be like? am i studying enough? how many times should i review the material? i know that it is better to ""overlearn"" something, but in doing so, i think i will go crazy. i try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top of the previously assigned work. i cannot convert into a complete ""bookworm"" because i would not be at ease with myself. i need time to relax and just chill with my friends. it is almost a set system that i have with myself that i read as much as i can, and then i go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. it's kind of ironic that the thing i reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, i have a killer soar throat. from what, i have no idea. it's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. i'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because i hate being sick. i love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. yes, i am aware of dayquill, but it has such a bad taste. gross. it does work, though. hopefully what i have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever i had the other day. i was burning up. the only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. i took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the hbsa called to invite me out to eat. i really wanted to go, but i couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that i couldn't go because i want to be able to be as involved as i can in any organization that i join. i felt as though i had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. thursday, i will hosting for apple computer at the hbsa company night. i think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but i need to do some ""boning"" up on the apple company before i speak with any of the recruiters. of course, i will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when i have four classes, and which is also the day that i promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night i was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. from everything i have mentioned, i have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that i am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if i really could have done something or not, or even where i stand in life. weeks before i came to ut, it seemed like i had a firm grip on life. i had a group of friends that i partied with all the time, and while i knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while i still have my ties, i now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, ""what am i doing with myself?"" i know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because i am ""building"" myself, but i don't think i can completely be myself yet, because i don't know ""completely"" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, ""be yourself. "" i'd say that half of the people at this school don't know who that is. in any case, i need to go smoke.

"well, here i go with the good old stream of consciousness assignment again. i feel like i'm back in freshman hs english class again. not that that's a bad thing, mind you, but my english teacher freshman year made us do these assignments constantly, and mine were always completely ridiculous, like, ""wow, i'm really hungry. i wish i could go to taco bell. "" they really had no point, except as busy work. in a psychology class, though, i can see the reasoning behind an assignment like this. just letting my mind go free, and putting my random thoughts down in writing could be a big help in figuring out why i'm such a psychological screw-up. well, that's not true. i don't want y'all getting the wrong idea about me, being that today was the first day of class and all. i'm really not a nut case. people may think i am, but really, i'm a normal kind of gal. actually, down here in texas, i guess i'm not normal. i don't like to eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and country fried steak with fried okra for dinner. i'm from connecticut, and we don't even have okra, much less worship it like it's some kind of vegetable goddess. my mind is starting to go blank--performance pressure i guess. i'm on the spot here--i don't want you all to be bored while you're reading this, if you ever do get around to reading this, that is. well, i'm not going to stress just yet, so you're probably going to have to listen to some of my random, incoherent babbling for a few paragraphs. these computers are a big old pain in the ass. here in the smf, sure, they've got a bajillion computers, but unfortunately, we've got 42 bajillion students trying to use them, all at the same time. i think i'll be spending quite a few late, late nights in the computer center, just to get my stuff done. yippee. that's what college is all about--late nights in the libraries. yeah. right. at this point, i don't even know what college is all about. i probably shouldn't say anything though, seeing as how i'm going to have to write another one of these thingys in a few days, where the topic is ""college"" blah, blah, blah. i can't believe i'm actually doing this assignment on the same day that is was assigned! go me! talk about dedication. i really can't believe this. in high school, procrastination was my middle name. no, it was my first name. by second semester, i have more free periods in a day than actual classes, so i didn't have to do a damn thing. it was great! unfortunately, because of that, i'm going to have to work that much harder here at ut, to get those studying skills back up to par. high school. now that was a trip. when i was there, i couldn't wait to get out of there. i hated that school, that town, everything except my friends, of course. then, my family moved, right after graduation, and i learned real quick that there were worse places to be than in my old town. at least back home i have my friends and my boyfriend and my piece of crap car, and i knew what there was to do. after i moved, i had no friends, no life, no car, no nothing. i worked all day. that's it. now, though, i'm ready for this whole college thing. austin seems like a fun city, where i might actually enjoy spending the next four years. oh yeah. while we're on the subject of ""four years,"" why is it that all the professors & administrators that give speeches and stuff always make it sound like we'll be in college for like, 5 or 6 years? i'm sorry, but i plan on graduating in 4 years. what's the problem here? what are people doing, that they can't graduate in 4 years? i just don't get it. no offense if any of y'all reading this took like 7 years to do your undergrad work. i'm not trying to knock you, just trying to figure this out. well, it's 9:19, exactly 18 minutes after i started this nifty little piece of writing that makes no sense and has no point. i'm not really sure if i have fulfilled this assignment, like if i was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness, where it took me, and what that means regarding my own personality. i guess if i had to, i could say that my mind works in mysterious ways, and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected, to me, i can see the patterns. yeah. i just went back & tried to read this over again, and i've got to give a suggestion. for these assignments, make the box we're writing in a box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time, without have to scroll across , because it's a real big pain for me, and i'm sure it's just as big a pain for you when you're trying to read it. unless, of course, when you read it, you can see the whole line at once. i don't know, just a suggestion! thanks for taking the time to give us all the opportunity to get an easy 10 % of out final grade through these writing assignments!

"well, i'm at ut now, and boy, is it a different life. everything is different now; no more mom's home cooked meals and i have to do my laundry now. i'm going to go back every two weeks and take my laundry home. i will only need two weeks' worth of clothes and then i can take it all home and get them washed. one main thing i like about ut are women! wow, there are some sexy women here. then again, there are also the ugly girls. they will always be around, but at ut, the ratio of hot to ugly girls is much better than what i have seen before; at least that's what it seems like. i guess women are the motivation to stay here in school. i could never go to an allboys school. i would go crazy! there would be nothing to look forward to. talking about women, i went back home last weekend and i met my very good friend, stephanie. we have been friends for years, but only recently have we gotten really good friends. for example, she took me out for dinner and a movie before i had to leave for college, and she has been telling me how much she will miss me. i think ever since i broke up with my old girlfriend, stephanie has gotten closer to me. i am definitely happy about it. she is the sweetest girl i know, and she looks great too. i've been emailing her quite often and i plan to visit her every time i go home. college relationships can be hard when the person you like lives far away. the main reason my relationship with my last girlfriend ended was because of college. she mainly did not want to go through a longdistance relationship, and i agree with her. however, i have known stephanie for way too long, and there is no way that i can simply ignore her. well, i'm not sure what to talk about now. i'm in my room and i really do not want to do this psychology assignment. my friend just called me and he asked me to play a computer game with him. i really want to play, but i still have to type what is on my mind. i am going to talk some more about stephanie. i guess, she is the main thing that is on my mind. i cannot stop thinking about her. her high school homecoming is coming up this october, and i think i will tell her that she can go with me if she has no one else in mind. after all, we went together last year. i am pretty sure that she knows that i have a crush on her. especially since i gave her a kiss on the cheek two nights ago. i was surprised when she asked me to come over and watch a movie with her. she looked terrific that night; i'm pretty sure she wanted to look good for me. either way, we had a good time and i made her laugh several times. i think it is really important to keep a girl happy in order to have a healthy relationship.

"my first week at ut has been okay despite the humid weather, long walks to class, and lack of sleep. already i am behind on most of my reading assignments. my math homework which is due sunday is incredibly hard. other than that, i have met new people and taken part in new experiences. for example i have never shared any of my stuff with anyone. but when i came to ut, i must share everything, including a dorm room, ethernet cable, printer, etc. with my friends, roommate, strangers, etc. life here is so different. there are so many types of people and the population of economics and psychology are overwhelming to me. the size of those classes is just a little smaller than my graduating class in high school. another problem is that i must force myself to wake up in the mornings and walk to class. right now my roommate is asleep which i am busily doing my homework and yet i am still behind. i can even hear her snore. sometimes this is very distracting to me; however, you must learn to cope with these dilemmas. i have never understood why i chose to come ut. i have realized that getting into the business program is not that important because i am not the only one that got in. i guess i came here because my friends did. they influenced me that going to ut was cheaper than if i went out of state to uc davis. i took their advice, although sometimes i wonder if i made the right decision. last night, some of my friends tried to convince me to attend a frat party. i knew she was never like this in arlington. i knew she was curious about what it was like, but everyone should know what to expect at one of these parties. i am glad i didn't go. i am feeling overwhelmed, scattered, and tired right now. i hear noises of people doing laundry, the air conditioner, the stupid building fans that are spinning below my dorm, etc. the lighting in here is horrible because i don't want to turn on the light in case it would wake up my roommate. although i am somewhat considerate of others like my roommate, are they considerate of me? i always clean up my messes, but she hardly ever does. for example if my hair is left in the bathtub, i always wash them down the drain and when water splashes out from the sink i clean it up, but will she do the same for me. i guess not since her hair is always laying around in the sink and her items take up most of the tub and sink area. well, i guess this is what it is like living with another person. i tend to complain a lot about things. maybe i do this because i am stressed out or really mad at something. sometimes on these assignments it is really hard to describe what you are feeling. when i was given this assignment in high school psychology, we had a certain word amount that had to be obtained. so i used ands and ums as additional words. twenty minutes is actually a long time to write such an assignment. i am still thinking about what to write. there are so many things i need to finish. one for example is my calculus homework. so as my twenty minutes is about to end, i hope ut will bring me many great memories.

"well this really pisses me off. i write you assignment to send to you but i get no connection. so i save it and try to do send it again. it got lost, even worse i have to do this again just turn this stupid thing in. for something i have already did, this really pissed me off. so to make sure you get this thing i'm thinking about emailing this to you. and to think i actually did truly analyze myself for this project, tell you my true feelings and you don't even get to see it. this is what is really going in my sub- consciousness. you well probably are not going to get a memo like this class. too bad, i really had a great paper or memo you could have really thought about. it was about time, and since i have to do this the second time, it's even hardier to write about. speaking of time i have about 5 minutes left so here it goes. i feel that time is one of the most under-rated things in this world today. just look at me i'm writing this memo for the second time today and have to do the other one tomorrow. now that was a lot of stress for just one day. still i accomplish more things under pressure, i think that is what i'm best at. well it is time for me to depart, so i hope i well learned something in your class. man, this really is stress releasing.

"well, here goes nothing. i decided to do this assignment while waiting for class. i arrived at 3, class starts at 3:30,my bad. guess i'll just transfer it to computer later. this hallway isn't particularly quiet. the door next to me squeaks. not like a mouse mind you, but that annoying oil-me-sound. this hallway looks different than all the others. i don't know why that is exactly, it just does. i don't seem to be having that many creative thoughts. my suite-mate told me that you become most creative during the late hours like 2 and 3a. m. i guess this is my creative down-time. boy, i could sure use a little down-time. too many things still left to do. somewhere in here i have to eat dinner. i refuse to eat from the death carts again today. granted, they do have good eggrolls. but i just don't want figure out what the meat is. dog would be very bad. i've got a dog, or at least i had a dog. i had to leave him at home. i guess i'll see him at christmas. i like it how the semester ends at christmas. less to worry about over the holidays. unlike high school. i hated it when teachers would have tests right after long vacations. not that i did bad on them. it just meant i had to think about the upcoming test for the duration of break. y'know, it's going to be hard to type all this one-handed. i fractured my finger about a week before class. for the time being my finger is immobilized. you'd be surprised at all the times we use our pinky and take it for granted. it is a very essential finger. only 5 more weeks or so, and it will be healed. personally, i can't wait. i've really had an interesting time as a new student. adapt to college and adapt to the loss of complete hand movement. which is essentially the loss of my left hand. i wonder how long this is typed. it's 2 pages written. ouch#@** my leg is asleep. pins & needles are always a fun sensation. i wonder how much longer it will be till class. almost there i think. i feel good that i actually completed a paper weeks before the deadline. it's not a first, but it's close. i've decided one thing about ut, tex hates me. he asked me if i wanted him to search for one of my classes, and of course i said yes. so tex replied that my class had been added from 7-9. no problem, right? he neglected to mention p. m. i am no longer enrolled in anthropology. good-bye and good luck.

"at this very moment i am feeling slightly depressed. my roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. that's great. the first weekend of school and she decides to go home. she left me all alone even for the first football game. it's not that i am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. it gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. i'm also a little stressed. moving to college has been fine for me. i haven't gotten home sick, really. and i'm having a lot of fun. but adjusting to how much work i have now is hard. i one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. that's impossible here. and if your not computer literate your screwd. so that means that i am screwed. but on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. i have no option if i want to succeed. succeeding is important. i was valedictorian of my high school. i think that is a curse. it seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. and it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. i want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. i hope it happens. i really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. he is 26 and lives in dallas. what a bummer. not that he is 26 but that he lives in dallas. it is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. most of the time i don't know how to read him. what is he thinking? that worries me most of the time. i don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. we once got into a fight and he told me that i had become to dependent on him. that really pissed me off. i don't believe that i had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. bored because he had moved and i had nothing else going on at the time. how dare he call me dependent. how am i suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to dallas and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. dependent my ass! it just really irritates me. but i don't know what to think about it. moments like these, when i'm all alone is when i miss him the most. and i try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time i can't help it. then i have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. its him that has the problem. why does he have to be so independent? i don't believe that someone can be totally independent. everyone from one time to another needs someone. everyone. so why does he have to act as if he doesn't. i wonder if my time is up yet. i honestly don't think that this has helped me much. its just made me think more. great. yes my time is up. good.

"i forgot that we were going to be timed, i wonder if we have to type well, i wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. this is kind of harder than i thought. so should i go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? oh well, i don't think i will. i'll just keep going. i need to keep typing about something. i need to type what i'm feeling. i'm feeling a little stressed because i have to keep typing all this time. i wonder how long this should be, especially if i have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. it's only been three minutes. geez! i thought this was going to be an easy assignment. well, it is relatively easy. it's just different from what i expected. i wonder if sarah and christen have gone to bed yet. i never know how late they stay up because i'm always. oh my phone is ringing! but i can't pick it up because i have to keep typing. oh well. they can wait. i bet it's larry. i still haven't met him. but liz said he wasn't even that cute. he is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. i need to call jennie and make sure we can all go out on friday night. my shoulder is sore. i wish i was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. that would be so nice. i can't believe i ate those tiffany's treats cookies. i hate that. it takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. but then i just come home and waste all of the calories i burned off on cookies. i wonder why i get those cravings for sweets. i keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. i'm running around the track in such pain. i really hate to run. well, i guess i don't hate it. it does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. but while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! it takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. i wonder who is actually going to read this? i hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. i don't know if that even makes sense. natalie, my friend at byu wrote that today in her email. i have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. i feel that way mostly because i lack the. see i can't even think of the words. i lack the ability to think of the words. the bottom line is i need to work on my vocab because i just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike natalie. however, i did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while i was getting my school supplies. i realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. but then ironically when i finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, i couldn't find them in my dictionary! i never look words up because i just lacked the motivation and then when i finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! it just goes to show that i can try but i'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. maybe i need to read more. i need to read the newspaper everyday. i hated hearing that i had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. my neck still hurts. i need a massage. i would love to just get massages all the time. that would be so nice. i only have two minutes left. it feels like i haven't been typing for very long. i think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. i still can't type very fast. almost done. 30 seconds. wow this is a long 10 seconds.

"pennebaker i used to think it was spelled pennebaker and i couldn't logon to the web page cause i kept spelling it wrong, silly me. but that's the story of my life i guess, one time, i thought i was going to psy class, but i had the day wrong, and i ended up going to a chemistry class!! and i said to the guy next to me, ""is that the usual guy who teaches?"" and he goes, ""yeah"" duh. and my eyes are pretty bad and so i was like, okay. and then well, he started talking about chemistry, and that's when i realized that i had the wrong day and was in the wrong class. but i was such a nincompoop, for some reason, i just didn't want to leave the class, maybe it was the really hot girl who sat down next to me, yeah, i guess it was probably her, but anyway i ended up staying in there and finding the class very interesting, and so i wouldn't look like a freshman, which of course i am, i started to take notes. you know, i won't keep them or anything, but i couldn't just sit there while this guy was giving this awesome lecture and not take notes!!! especially when that girl next to me was taking notes so fast like. but there's too many girls are this school. i mean, wait, i mean, too many girls who think they're pretty and try to hard. maybe there's too many guys in the same class, i wouldn't know. but like, i find it amazing. i mean, of course, in highschool, they're were girl who tried so hard to impress everyone and make themselves so beautiful, and all us guys were like the ones who try the hardest are the ones who fail the hardest!!! fail meaning don't do a good job of making them selves look good. i don't know, i just always preferred the beautiful ones who didn't have to paste on the makeup on for hours every morning. sometimes, i would and still wonder how long it takes a particular girl to get ready to go to a college class. it looks like it takes them forever! it's amazing, i just get up, take a shower, do the person hygiene things that everyone does, put some clothes on, and go. i don't know. maybe i should spend more time getting myself prettier. i just find it disgusting, that's all. and one time, one of my friend sent me this email with the most awful, brutal, disgusting pictures i've ver seen. i was so depressed for like days after i saw them. i don't know what they were of, i mean, if it was a war or what not. but it was these pictures of people who were dead, and they way the died, it was just horrid. i mean, i've seen some nasty deadly pictures of hanging and shooting people and everything, but these were just simply horrid. and i never get sad or depressed these days, at least not any more. i used to be though. and get this, it was cause of a girl that i was so depressed!! can you believe that!? i was going out with her, right, and it was all good, and then one day she said not any more, and i couldn't believe it. it was such a shock, i was amazed, and therefore depressed for like, well, for months, probably around 6 months were i felt that i was leading two separate lives!! it was horrible. and you know, with things like that, the only thing that helps is time. lots of it. i guess that's what my uncle is going through. uuhh, lemme see, i think it was probably about 5 months ago, maybe more, maybe less, my cousin was at a party where many illegal substances were being used, cocaine, speed, you know, those terrible drugs. he ended up getting in to a fight over the use of a telephone with some african american male (my cousin and i are hispanics, well, i'm just half hispanic and half white, but he was pure blood) and they got into a fight, and the african american guy ended up stabbing my cousin and killing him. it was instant or anything, my cousin was a really big guy. strong and big and everything. he had a wife and a daughter. she's so beautiful. she had no idea what was going on at her fathers funeral. i mean, she's old enough to walk and talk and stuff like that, but she was clueless. and so i was i for that matter. she probably understood it more than i i did the more i think about it. his funeral was so so, well, the most beautiful and sad thing i've ever seen in my life. that's what my mom said about princess diana's death, but it pertains to this as well, at least for me. we buried him. in a cemetery, next to some family members. he was 21. it wasn't his time. it wasn't his place. but, god has a reason for everything, you know. i wonder if i'm just writing this out and nobody is going to read this, and i wonder if and when you, if there is a you, reads this, when that will be. it's 5:28 p. m. wednesday, august 10th, 1997. i miss him. another really close friend of mine died of cancer on march 13, 1995. but we won't go there, things just kind ad up you know? anyway, did you know that right now and for the past 2 decades neptune has been the farthest planet from our sun!? did you know that!? i didn't! i was amazing, my thumb is really hurrying from hitting the space bat so darn often. i miss my cousin. i didn't know him well enough. my other cousin, all the full blood ones, the true ones, they took it a lot harder that i did. they were into to things like that, and it was like a wake up call for them. for me, it was a wake up call that i don't' think i'm ever going to pick up. it's like it hasn't really happened, still. after all this time, i still hasn't really happened!!! is that amazing? talk about denial. but it's more than just denial for me, i mean i truly still don't think it's hit home yet. it s just one of those things you read about, see on t. v. it's not something that happens to your cousin. my cousin was murdered. my cousin was murdered. can't believe that, saying that, my cousin was murdered!?

"o. k. here i am in the computer lab in my dorm. i really do not know what to say because i have never had an assignment like this before. anyway, college life is very different from my high school life. i do no t drink therefore being with a complete different crowd of people, i find myself being very uncomfortable. i suppose once i get settled and used to my new surroundings that everything will be fine. don't get me wrong, i love ut. i could not wait to get here, it is just the whole different atmosphere. i have met a lot of interesting people so far and i am sure there are many left to find and meet. my classes are so much more time consuming than i ever expected. i joined a sorority this year and now i never seem to have any time to myself. then there is the whole boyfriend situation. my boyfriend goes to a&m. real convenient right. i miss him so much when i am here. he is the best person i have ever met in my entire life. his generosity, compassion, sensitivity, and love amaze me. i am so happy when i am with him. he is coming tomorrow to see me. needless to say i am counting down the hours and minutes until he arrives. i have so much planned for us to do. i am fine being with out him. long distance relationships are harder than you think they would be. we are making it work however. i have never trusted anyone as much i do him. i think it is the same with him. i am not nervous about him being in a different town or setting - i know he would never do anything to hurt. it is just the whole being apart thing. it has only been two weeks since we have seen each other. sounds like a short time to everyone else but they just do not understand. that is another thing. i do not think many people understand me. my boyfriend, jay does- very well- it is almost scary well he knows and understands me. it also provides comfort though. i cannot believe this whole paper has turned into a description of my life with my boyfriend. anyway, he is coming tomorrow like i said and i cannot wait. next weekend i am going home to lufkin. jay is going with me. i was on drill team and will be returning to the homecoming game. it will be a nice break from the hectic college world. i miss my bed. there is something about your bed. the ones here are not the same. i miss my dog too. she is so sweet and loving. she used to sleep with me and now there is not a lump in the foot of my bed. well i believe my time is up. this was fun. i have never sat down and written out my thoughts and feelings - i think it helps!

"right now i feel like there must be something more important that i could be doing. that's not to say that what i'm doing right now is unimportant, but i feel that there is something more imperative looming. i feel like i need to clean my room because all of my clutter is getting annoying to look at. i feel like i brought to many things with me to college in order to ensure my comfort, but all these things are only making me more uncomfortable by their presence. tomorrow i have a test in chemistry that i think is going to be really easy. hopefully it turns out as easy as i think it will. i don't really need any surprises right now. i wonder if the medication i'm taking for my earache is giving me all these rashes or if it's just the less than par level of cleanliness in the mighty jester east. i heard that it's dirtier than jester west but i'm beyond caring. rat dander and roach feces don't bother me until i see them. the only thing that really nags me about my dorm room is the bed. who knows what nasty things that old mattress harbors? if i was really anal retentive i wouldn't be able to sleep on it because of the thought of all the stuff that it has probably accumulated over the years, but instead i succumb to fatigue, grimace in disgust, and lay my head down once again. speaking of which, my head itches. rat dander, i tell you. in addition to my concern over the probable existence of rat dander is my concern over the obvious existence of dust. i have never seen quite so much dust. they told us that the air conditioning system wasn't working properly and that they were working on it. it appears to work just fine in regards to spewing dust all over my precious things that annoy me so much. i guess i'll just have to buy some eye drops to go along with the calamine lotion for all these rashes i've been getting. i got the last bottle at jester store. it was sitting there sort of lonely like it didn't belong at all so i just grabbed it up. i scoff at the poor soul who doesn't develop rashes until a few days from now for he will be forced to go elsewhere for calamine. i think my leg rash might be flaring up again. that sucks. i wish i had absolutely nothing that i needed to do right now because then i could just sit in front of the tv watching a movie and scratching my leg. now that's the life. too bad i'm bogged down with college and all of this success waiting to happen to sit around and do nothing. and so ends my stream of consciousness as i am much too absorbed in my itchy leg to think any longer. plus my 20 minutes is up.

" i'm very worried about many things right now. i feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. i haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. i'm usually a guy that stays on top of things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like i'm not on top of things. i have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. i should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. i'm in houston right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. most of the time i was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. i find that houston is not as fun as it was. things are starting to change. my views and my emotions are quite different than before. i view my parents and my brother differently. i appreciate their company more than i did before. i guess i just miss them an awful lot. my brother and i are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in houston. i enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. i'm also kind of glad that i am going back to austin later today. i missed alot while i was gone. a friend's birthday party, ut's first football game, and a chinese bible study meeting that i was hoping to attend. i can gladly say that i don't regret comming to houston and being back home. i enjoyed it fairly well. suddenly, i feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. i'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that i should be doing, but i have a smile on my face. a sense of peace and a sense of sadness that i'm going to depart from this wonderful place i call home. both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. i can smell it from upstairs. i haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. university of texas is not what i had in mind. it is not as fun and exciting as i thought it would be. all my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. i guess things will get better as time progresses. i'm still not use to the freedom that i have and still not use to other things. i have also found out that i have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. i rather just be around those that i feel more comfortable around. the people at ut are nice thus far, i have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. i enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. i have learned that friendships are very important. since i use to move alot, from places to places, i have learned how to make friends and still be myself. i feel like i have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. i was very close to him and we were like brothers. now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. my friend has never dated before, but now is dating. he spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. i really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. i hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. college will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that i will never experience before. sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future nick chu.

" just as i moved to this page my roomate came into our apartment and it appears that he has brought some food back from the grocery store. that is always a good thing. now i'm thinking about how i can possibilly type my thoughts for this amount of time with out taking a break for some snacks and whatnot. today has felt like the longest day that i can remember and i can't figure out why. when i was in my math class at 11 in the morning i for some reason it felt to me as if it was 5 in the evening. now i am listening to the tv in the background and amthinking about how much i disagree with the news man. what is going to be typed by me in 5 minutes from now is flooding me with curiosity. i hope that this week goes by much faster then it is right now. i can't wait until texas plays north carolina this saturday. horns football is one of the top three reasons why i applied to the university of texas and i am very glad that i got in. now i am looking at a picture of the roadrunner from wiley cyotte however you spell it and it makes me think of apples and oragnges. that kind of scares me that random things like that just kind of pop up into my head, but oh well. now i am wishing that i had started some music to play as a was writing this because i am almost always interested in listening to music. yes my roomate is talking to me and he didnt know that i was home this entire time what a silly bastard. now i am listening to whiteny houston who is a supposed crack head butthat doesn't really bother me because she can sing ok. i wonder how many times she does crack cocaine a day or use too. sometimes i wonder what it feels like to be high on coke but i have never tried it. the reasons i haven't done coke is probably because most people i know that do coke are lost causes. my roomate thinks i'm an alcoholic because he heard me say i was drinking punch and i am but he thought it was trashcan punch which means his mind was on alcohol so maybe he is the alcoholic. i am not excited about having to go to three classes today because i am so very tired that i could easily take a nap and enjoy it a 100 times more. i have about 4. 25 minutes left, that makes me think about how much faster this writing assignment has gone thean i thought it would. what my life will be like 8 months from now is a random thought that just entered my mind. i wonder if i will still have my girlfriend, and i hope i do and i wonder if i will be less depressed than i am right now because at the moment i am at a time where very little makes me happy and i really didn't have that problem at all over the summer unless i was thinking about school again. i don't know exactly why but school changes my state of mind dramatically and quickly. i know i should be thankful to even go to school but how can i help the feelings that i have. now there are three two oh times up.

"well here i am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always, constantly hitting the backspace key. i just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books i have is signifigantly cheaper there and then i registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like i could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade at the going away dance only for eighth graders i won a bag of blowpops huge bag and i never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer i would find one and throw it away. my roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already i'm still just kind of trudging along. i'm really tired its time to go to bed i wonder if i should take advil because i had my wisdom teeth out on friday but i'm really tolerant to pain so i never even took the perscription pain medication- but i have no idea if anything is wrong because i just sort of ignore the pain. after i finish this i am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she doesn't know who of her friends will be here so he might stay in our dorm but i know that they won't do anything i'm probably going home because i live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it won't bother me he's a nice guy- i have only known jenny for 5 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too. we both grew up in the us with parents from taiwan so we have similar backgrounds. i filled out that survey it was so strange and so long. the pre-test thing. i'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives i'm such an innocent and i don't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions. one of our suite mates rushed and she got into zta and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and i asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because it's the first day of school and she has an 8:30 class tommorow but oh well it's not might life or my concern. this room is so cold. and she seems so smart to she took all the ap classes and i think she was on drill team too. and she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok i don't need a guy to make me happy even though i would like a boyfriend- i've never had one before that is so strange but that's ok. i saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that's ok. there are a few of us from church here also clement who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my differentials on norton or something- my brother like icqed me and told me to do it at least once a week i had no ide what he was talking about and i tried to do it. i can't believe i have so much to do already i have a lot of classes i thought it would kind of be like high school but i don't think so i saw a few people around campus that i know from church it was really weird thinking i knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 15 minutes early but that won't last long- especially those 8 o'clock classes oh i think i need to charge my cell phone i'm not sure oh well. well i think my twenty minutes is up and i'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so i guess i could read sociology until she is done but. well good night.

"i've never done this before, but hey, whatever. college is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments i've had to do so far for classes. i don't really know what to say. i just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in san antonio. i miss her. and borrowing her clothes. i miss my little sister, too. it's funny because i didn't think i'd really miss my family and most of the time i don't, but the other night i just got this sporadic mental picture of my dad. it was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. it sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. such is growing up. so, no one's going to read this. that's pretty good because i'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. i love that word. i try and use it whenever i can. ha! this is crazy. actually, pennebaker's class is one of the best i have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. i only took it because this girl i know said she knew pennebaker's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. and he is. and he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. i mean, some of my professors are crazy. i have this one professor who barely speaks english, which is cool and all, but really, how can i learn from someone i can't understand? and the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, ""in asia. "" at least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and i've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. i don't get it. does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in asia? because that's what we're studying right now. bacteria. and it's not even interesting. i mean, who really cares about ers and lipids and lysosomes? well, i guess that's a pretty dumb question. of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. i personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. really, guy. but i have to take the class, whether i want to or not. i only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, i'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. ah, geology. my eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. after this, i have some serious catching up to do. and it's not because i miss my classes or anything. i mean, i don't even drink. except for wine, and that's really only when i eat out, which i do less and less these days. these dayswhat am i talking about?! i've been here for less than a month. it feels like i've always been here, though. which is weird. i love austin, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. seriously, they're nasty. and what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? they're not, most of them anyway. my neck hurts. that professor i was talking about earlier, the one who speaks english very poorly? he sings in class. right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. and it's not like he's singing to himself. i mean, he's wearing a mike. we can all hear him loud and clear. and the only song he knows how to sing is ""oh, what a beautiful morning. "" except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. he's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, i would never go to class. that's pretty weird of me, right?

"ok, i have writer's block. i guess i'll think of this assignment as a diary. today was a pretty interesting day. i met a lot of people who spoke spanish, so that made me feel more at home. this stupid bracelet is bothering me. i miss isaac, my ex-boyfriend. i wonder if anyone's going to read this nonsense, and who ever is reading this, i feel sorry for them. i'm not that cool in my head. my room mate is gone. she is bowling. i wonder what she is doing. maybe sitting there bored. she is always bored everywhere we go she has this face, that makes me bored. i miss my family, even though when i'm there i don't really talk to them. i guess i'm just used to them being around. i wonder if i'm prone to meningitis? should i get the shot? knowing my luck, if i don't get, i'll be well, to dead in 24 hours. i'm scared of needles. damn, i'm scared of everything! oh, crap almost erased everything i had written. computers are not for me. what is for me? i like psychology. the lectures are super interesting. do i have any better word? nah, interesting is an ok word. i feel so non-intellectual. see, that just shows my inability to express myself in words. physically i'm very expressive. but i that's what i think. my ex probably doesn't think so. no, he does. i miss reading in u. i. l. i just realized that being in college makes you miss a lot of things. i wonder if i'm going to make it out of here? sometimes i meet people just like me and tell myself, don't worry you're not alone, but other times people are so articulate in class it intimidates me. i set a goal for myself when i first got here and i can't do it. i'm suppose to ask at least one question per class per week. but i just can't with all those people staring at me. once i open my mouth, they're going to realize what an idiot i am. this sounds so clich'. other people probably wrote all these philosophical questions on their stream of consciousness, like why are we here? did aristotle believe that as humans. well, i don't write like that. i'm just a bundle of unanswered questions. ahhh, my back's starting to hurt. i like that guy who walked me to my room. is that all were suppose to write. ok never mind. that girl from columbia is really nice. she reminds me of a friend from del rio. i hope i meet more people like her. it'll help me sleep better. i've had really bad insomnia. i could be depressed or just a freshman in ut. maybe both. i don't get what happened to my first letter in every sentence. it disappeared into the left side. what did i push? ok 40 seconds left. i'm so glad i'm almost done with my first assignment. is this what he wanted? i hope i did this right. bye.

trying to track my thoughts. that's weird because i don't even know were to start. at the moment i am wondering who just called because i thought one of my roommates would of answered it but they didn't and who every it was hung up. i am also worried about my food that is cooking in the oven. it is suppose to be done in thirty minutes and i sure am hungry. i kind of mad at the moment because the cowboys just lost to the cardinals and they shouldn't have. to tell you the truth its kind of hard to sit here and just type what i am thinking because i not thinking of anything. one of my roommates is talking on the phone and being really loud but she does have a big mouth. she is talking to my other roommate and asking him if he wants to meet the person on the phone for lunch tomorrow but they never ask me but i don't mind because the guy they are meeting gets on my nerves. that was weird. an icon came up on my screen and said my connection has been idle for twenty minutes and will disconnect if i don't click on the stay connected. i guess that means i have been typing for twenty minutes or maybe not. it is weird the way i have been typing for so long and i am just on the second line. i know i have typed more than that i hope. my back is starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly in this chair and typing but i guess i have typed for twenty minutes so i can stop now. i probably didn't type that much but i am not a good typer and i make a lot of mistakes. i guess i'll stop now. ,0,0.506358 -1.296302 0.555702 -1.707944 -2.218531 -2.530554 -0.613393 -0.707878 -1.753726 -1.355349 -0.092581 -0.590446 0.970763 1.220418 0.071916 0.0 -0.04277 0.018901 0.337528 -0.795527 0.141889 -0.243638 0.24202 0.345535 -0.624052 0.748085 0.21909 0.810807 -0.355882 -0.801229 -1.100231 -0.692134 0.37333 -0.011251 -0.409603 0.506887 0.735479 0.7514 0.374984 0.451464 1.407858 1.270958 -1.011965 0.036439 -1.429535 2.450209 -1.093488 0.701787 3.269079 -0.328444 -0.263872 -0.047308 0.533787 0.436416 -0.331296 0.29133 2.516581 -0.954251 -0.046302 0.262384 -1.939937 -0.95129 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.490768 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.142776 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.262055 4.512484 3.969099 4.209468 4.19627 4.666213
"right now i am sitting in my dorm room. wondering whether or not i should do this on the word processor. because this assignment seems so fun that even if the information doesn't get there, i wouldn't mind doing it again. i accidentally just sent you people a blank page because i forgot to scroll down. i really miss home. i have the music on and i keep finding sad music to listen to because it reminds me of my family. i don't think that i will mind this later, but right now, i'm having a bit of trouble adapting to this new life. i am not really too sad, just extremely disoriented. there are only a few people here who i am good friends. even my boyfriend has changed, and seeing him change (he has been here for three months)makes me wonder how much i will change this year. he even looks different. i think that being in college makes him more attractive, just because he holds himself differently. i wonder if i will look different. i already feel more independent and mature, even though i think that i always have been. just being away from home gives me a bit of a different perspective on things. people are up here and they are talking about how they are "" independent because they are doing their own laundry""! i sit there thinking ""what! i have been doing my own laundry since i was in 6th grade!"" my parents brought me up, always encouraging me to help myself, meaning that they didn't want me to expect everyone to do things for me. out of all of my friends, i am the only one whose expenses (personal and what my scholarship doesn't cover) come straight out of my account. my parents don't plan on having to wire me any money this semester, or maybe even the next. i worked this summer and saved my money for that reason. i wanted to make things a bit easier on them. my friends talk about their depleted bank accounts, but even though they worked as well, the only thing that makes use of their money is anything that revolves around their personal interests (aka shopping) i had to buy my own books, a good three hundred dollars that i could have used for something else, even though i probably would have just saved it all, because i love the feeling of having money. it is not just the security, but the feeling of accomplishment, and feeling like i am not just throwing away my money on material things. even though i always want to shop and i always see things that i want, i never indulge because i feel like if i start i won't be able to stop. but seriously, i really do want some more clothes because i recycle the same shirts in a matter of a week and a half. that could also have something to do with the unbearable heat. it was 113 degrees the other day and i have four hours between classes. by the time i get back from my first two classes, i already feel all icky, so i change shirts. oh, today i went inside a sorority house. i don't really understand what the difference is between a dorm wing and a sorority. after all, they are essentially the same thing. you get food and shelter and you get to meet a lot of people. it is up to you to build that ""sorority"" with the people in your wing. but i think the same kind of relationship is possible for girls who are living in the dorm. speaking of girls, when my boyfriend moved up here, he and his roommate became friends with this girl who i don't like. she is over at their apartment day and night because her friend lives in the same complex. my boyfriend thinks that she is really funny, and i know that he thinks she is pretty because he told me so. it seems like they have more in common than we do. i am a really jealous person and i am really jealous of her. i feel like she is better in every way than i am. she is taller and prettier. and he laughs at her so much. my boyfriend cheated on me once in the very beginning of our relationship, with his exgirlfriend. i think that by nature i am already a jealous person, (wow pepsi one is really gaseous because i never burp and this is the first time i have ever tasted it. i just burped out of nowhere) where was i? oh yeah. since he cheated on me it is really hard to trust him. so far he has betrayed my trust but i can't help but forgive him because i feel so much for him. i always looked down on people, girls, who let guys walk all over them. and even though it may seem like that is what's happening, that is not the way i see it. i don't no why. i know that it sounds really naive, but i feel like we are different. now i know that you should not judge people or assume things about them until you have been in their position. i know that i have been talking for more than twenty minutes, and i really don't like thinking about these boyfriend crises, even though i do it more than i should. anyway that is the stream of my consciousness.

 right now i am sitting at the computer feeling very good that i am finally doing this assignment. it had been on my mind ever since it was assigned. i can't wait till i am done. because i know i will feel a sense of accomplishment . ever since the lecture on tuesday every time i think i can picture that video we saw in class where the part of the brain was warming up or so called cooking. i imagine my brain is cooking right now trying to think of what to write next. earlier today i found my emotions changing alot today and i tried to figure out why they changed so much at one point i was extremely shy and the next minute i was outgoing. right now i feel very comfortable with myself and extremely confident. my thoughts are going every which of way right now. because i feel pressure to do well in school from myself and my parents. i really would like to please them and show them i am responsible and smart. i feel as though it is not me right now. i find it truly fascinating that my mind is coming up with some of these things right now. i find it really intriguing. now even after going to class i really feel like hearing the lectures really has made me realize alot of stuff i had not noticed before especially trying to feel what i really feel not what i just think i feel. it just occurred to me that i have not looked up once to see how much time has gone by. i could write this for a while just tracking my different thoughts and feelings and emotions. when i mentioned something earlier about my parents and how i wanted to impress them. i pictured my parents and started having feelings of love because i know they are there for me if i need them. i never have stopped and traced my thoughts before until now. i am wondering now if the tests are going to be hard in this class. i feel pretty hungry right now so i can imagine my stomach relaying something to my part of my brain telling me it is time to eat. i wish i could get controller the part of my mind that controls addiction because i sure would like to quit smoking. i feel as if i have no control over it anymore. when i smell cigarettes smoke. i feel my mind say wouldn't it be nice to have one of those. i guess quitting smoking is telling that part in your mind no and to be stronger than that. that was weird how my mind suddenly brought up smoking i guess because i know i have to quit because it is so bad for you. well that's time i really enjoyed this assignment. ,0,0.602538 -0.291276 -0.189043 -0.6514 -0.060235 0.351424 1.282173 -0.261111 -0.648166 -0.707832 -0.119897 -0.590446 0.005537 1.336523 1.767231 0.0 -0.04277 1.190564 1.774485 -0.46317 1.747492 -0.096589 -0.636696 0.636236 -0.624052 -1.727562 0.361819 -0.497193 -0.823241 -0.044319 -0.120817 0.96055 -1.133606 0.252569 -1.017959 -1.109326 2.582074 2.623399 1.642514 -0.780322 6.089156 -0.342341 -0.360669 3.645992 0.360699 0.303826 5.285156 -1.163553 -0.021248 -0.882212 -1.34699 1.911189 0.886763 0.172235 -0.518558 -0.901782 0.504935 -0.954251 -0.693745 -1.180643 -0.423761 1.340398 -0.480161 -0.175133 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.292692 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.426902 -0.451544 -0.033792 -1.554528 5.098384 3.634123 4.75853 5.07553 4.064421
"stream of consciousness, i can't even spell it right, in any case i'm sitting here its 10:50 in the morning and i do not feel like doing all this crap today. too many classes when i'd rather just sit here doing nothing whatever its stupid anyway i feel like sleeping or some nonsense. nose itched. anyway i wonder what i'm going to do tonight about all that homework good god its exhausting i should taken less hours or at least not calculus that class it kicking me in the butt, i don't know anything. tangents. velocity. who freaking cares i'm no physicist, but for some reason to be an economist i need to know how to calculate velocity of a ball and decide what dosage to give patients based on tangent and secant line. honestly i don't care i just want to get out there and keep going. chris is probably at school right now, i wonder what he is doing. oh he is in government, he better be bringing that c up to a b right now on that test. if he just tried he could be so much smarter but i distracted him and made him get the c to begin with, but its still his fault. damn nose. whatever. i just want him to do well on this one. i like it when he is smart but i don't always because i begin to feel inferior. in any case, i love him no matter how he is i just wish he had help himself more. he is working tonight, so we can do something this weekend, i paid like 50 bucks last weekend because he had no money, its not like i'm rich. i work for my money i took out loans. my dad has not had a job since he got out in 8 months. i'm not rich. he starts his job on october 1 so that is really good because my family will be a lot better off. its quite exciting for us since we've had such little money for a while now. i'm not going to get stuck up because of it either. i wish someone would send me some mail i check that stupid box everyday and i don't get anything why can't someone just send something to be nice beth got a box and i still have not gotten anything. just a fucking postcard or something would be nice. oh well. ill mail someone something first then they'll have to write back, or not. i like my penguin picture, he is waving but he looks sad. i'm sorry penguin. thirsty. yuck. that cherry coke is disgusting, it tastes like carbonated water. gross and i paid 85 cents for that shit. what is up with my face itching while i?m writing this stuff. ooo. i'd rather be playing my game right now, although i really should be working out ill never be ready for thr pft like this. can't do all those pushups and i don't know how fast i run. ill run till i vomit i guess. nose itches again. i love chris he is such a nice boyfriend. not like those other guys who didn't really treat me right. chris is not perfect but he has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship and madison and all the shit that caused. in any case, we are happy now and madison can kiss my ass. he asked me to marry him in a sense that we aren't engaged but we will marry each other, we're moving in pretty soon together, i wish he had stop being such a mama's boy and tell her to get over it. i'll probably be the one that convinces her to pay for it and be happy about it. saves a lot of money and chris and i can be together. we fight and stuff but its never big stuff. my parents will be fine with it. my dad will take a while to get used to it but my mom will support me if i really want it. it saves like 300 a month by doing it this way. my nose!. 15 minutes. u got to be kidding me this should be over by now. he should make it 15 minutes for next semester's class. actually 25. i want them to work more than i did. lalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalallllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. your my best friend. oooooooooo youre more than a lover there could never be another to make me feel the way you do. oooooooooo we just get closer fall in love all over. what a good song love that tim mcgraw his wife is cute too such a cute couple. jamie just got online. that girl does

"i really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention. i am listening to a dave matthew's cd. i was never really a big fan of his until recently. my roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves dave matthews. she asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. i had heard a few of his songs, and even though i wasn't crazy about them, i agreed to go. it was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to houston to go to graduate school. dave m. was going to be in houston on friday and austin on saturday. so robyn ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help justin move and see the concert in houston. on our way to houston the u-haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. robyn was devastaed. so saturday we headed back to austin and bought tickets to go. after several beers we were there. somehow i got seperated from my friends. when we found each other i cried, i think it was from the alchol. anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. i pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. at the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to dave. i was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. we talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing i had on me). he left but came uback up to me five min later. i was talking to somebody and i saw soomeone come up besaide me. then i felt a hand on my breast (the right one). it was dave, signing my chest. i thought i would faint. his voice is so sexy. later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. i love him and will marry him one day. sorry i wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. i guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. i just thought of something else. i have a crush on a waiter that i work with. i'm a hostess. i haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. i'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until friday. i don't even know anything about him. that's probably why i like him. the last guy i dated was gay. he won't admit it but i know he is. we're not seeing each other anymore. i usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. i just set up my email account today. i'm soo excited. my parents have been bugging me to get one. i'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by friday. i really hope no one reads this horrible shit. i know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. i have to go read 19 chapters for english now. aren't you jealous??!!

" hi, well. i'll start out by introducing myself. my name is christina acevedo. i am a freshman here at the university of texas. just recently i got off the phone with my girlfriend. aahhh. i love her soo much. we have been together for 4 years and 8 months already. except, just two nights ago we had a little argument, or should i say miscommunication . she told me some things that i really didn't enjoy hearing, and of course, i got upset. and reacted. at that point i didn't really feel like talking to her the rest of the night, or even the next day. but i fell asleep thinking about it. which wasn't really smart because it made me even more mad. so, that morning i woke up at 8:00 am to go to my first class. it was one of my farthest classes, so of course i had more time to think. after that class, i came home and wrote her an e-mail. i was so confused and i had so many mixed feelings towards her. i wasn't sure what was going on. just that i loved her and that i still wanted to be with her. well, needless to say, we talked about it afterwards. and of course, we're still together. thank god!! :) so everything is going really well right now. and i'm glad because we don't live in the same city either, so its not that easy. i come here to ut and she goes to a&m in college station. and i have to admit, long distance relationships suck, but when it comes down to those one or two or three weekends out of the month that you get to see each other, they're great! and i guess that's it for that subject. right now i'm watching shop til you drop. i remember watching this show and supermarket sweet a really long time ago. so, they're probably all reruns. right after i get through with this i am going to go downstairs and have dinner. i'm pretty hungry even though i just had a couple of snacks up here in my dorm. i live at the castilian. it is really a neat place. and it is a convenient location for me because my classes don't seem to be so far. my parents didn't let me bring my car over here to austin my first year. i was pretty bummed out about that, but i wouldn't have used it to drive to school anyway. it would be parked here in the castilian's garage, which by the way, costs $900 for the two semesters. although, it would come a lot in handy on the weekends when i wanted to go out and hang out with my friends, or to go and visit my girlfriend in college station. speaking of which, i saw her this past weekend. (labor day weekend). me and a friend of mine left here on saturday morning, it took us about an hour and a half to get there, and then we drove back and partied here. it was a blast! although my girlfriend got a little carried away drinking and ended up throwing up for some of the night. but it was ok because she was really fun before we went to bed. we also tried going to a club called boyz cellar, but my friend (robyn), the one who picked me up, is 17. so they didn't let her in because you have to be 18, so of course, none of us went in. that pretty much sucked because i was really looking forward to that. i guess we'll just wait for another good weekend and we'll all go because her birthday just so happens to be about two weeks from now. and now about school. let me tell you, the classes here at ut are not going to be anything easy, thats for sure. i am taking 6 classes (15 hours). i am trying to major in biology, but. my strong point is absolutely not biology. and thats because this semester i am taking biology 211, biology 212, chemistry 301, calculus 408k, cardiovascular and weight training, and of course, psychology with you. so, i'm looking forward to a pretty tough semester. i just know that i have to study a lot and listen in class and take good notes and hopefully everything will go my way. i don't really want to start off bad because it is not a good impression on the professors or anybody who is looking for someone to fill a job opening. my goals for the future would have to be that i want to live with my girlfriend, somewhere very nice. and i want to be someone that makes pretty good money. and i want to have a couple of pets. not too many. and i know that my girlfriend wants a lot. she probably has been planning some part of her future in her mind. like, at least what kind of house she wants, or something of that sort. i mean, she already has the exact ring that she wants when she gets married. she wants it to be white gold, with a big rock on it. sounds pretty simple, doesn't it?! :) so yeah. and. well, i think my parents are going to come up and visit soon. i really didn't want them to come up here, i'd rather go down there. because i think that maybe i would feel awkward having my entire family in my dorm for a while. and then hanging out with them here on the weekend. i think i would be too tempted to just be like, ok. well, i'll see you tomorrow afternoon, and go out to a club or something. but, well. that's all for now. i can't really think of anything else to type. my mind has totally gone blank. i have typed everything that i am thinking and maybe even everything that i have thought about the entire day. well maybe a few exceptions. and the time and minutes on top don't seem to be moving at all. i don't know exactly how much time i have left to type. but the twenty minutes have seemed to go by pretty fast.

"seriously in my mind right now i have so many levels of thought that i can easily access by simply starting to think about something, everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once i analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what i think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is, because everything has its specific purpose. a lot of things that i thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our (human) use and that is what they are specifically there for. everything is for us. humans. everything. we utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can. this alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade, making sure that on one takes any along the way. if someone takes our lemonade, we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much? when and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back? but if someone drinks it then we can't get it back, so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are? notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us. even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking. controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do. basically, this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person. the more people widely accept a thought, the more it is thought to be what we think as ""normal"" but just because a thought isn't in everyone's mind, then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy? in our minds, social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are ""weird"" but this is the main problem with our world. if everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because. well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time, please pardon my language but i felt i must stress the importance of the statement. may i please stress it again? damn, there i did it. there is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why. they must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be. people that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed. i see the irony in my statements above because i said simply that we must accept the world for what it is, but here's the thing. i have personally not yet learned to do this because i still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that i wish to change or eradicate: the fact that people don't just accept the world and people in their ""out of the ordinary"" state of minds for just the way that it is. simply put. the way that it is. the way that it is. if i could understand that then i believe that i will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach. i am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than i ever thought i could be. i don't think there are any major flaws in our world that i cannot look at with an open mind and. accept, if you will. i say ""if you will"" because i feel that ""accept"" may not properly convey what it is that i am trying to express. by accept, i mean. look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why? well who knows and it is okay not to know. i need not know the meaning of everything but i have a deep appreciation for it. there it is. i have a deep appreciation for it. i was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world. i appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people's personalities and i choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind. no one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it. i feel it with everything that i do and i only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself. everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities (without bearing harm to others of course, because that is the definite point where a specific line is crossed), and this is simply our duty to the world.

"i have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here i am writing about my thoughts. i am completely amazed that i can do this assignment on the internet. i mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet. sometimes i wonder if the internet is just getting way to big. i hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself. personally i do not completely understand what they mean by that. but it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want. i guess, like most things in life, the internet has its good points and its bad points. this writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college! it is so weird that i am now a college student. i still feel like i don't completely belong here. i have met a lot of cool people, but it definately does not feel like home. for some reason i have not come to realization yet that i am here for like seven more months. i still have no idea what i want to study. my major right now is microbiology. i was planning on becoming a doctor, but i'm not completely sure. i think that is what i want to be but i am interested in so many things. i'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if i'll like that. i am good at math and science so i considered engineering. the only problem with engineering is that i really don't understand what an engineer does! i love science so i guess the medical field is good for me. lately though i have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian. it involves science and animals and i absolutely love animals. the problem with deciding on a major is that i have no clue what each major entails. i guess i will have to go and research all the different majors i have been thinking of. this past june i went to this program called national youth leadership forum on medicine in boston. i did not really want to go but i decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor. it did not really do that, but it was an interesting experience. we went to harvard medical school and talked to med students there. that was interesting because i was expecting like a bunch of einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations. actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself. also at the forum we went on hospital tours and some kids (i wasn't one of the lucky ones) got to shadow a doctor for a day. my friend harris was able to actually watch open heart surgery. she said she saw the doctors flatline the heart (i guess the do that in open heart surgery) and then revive it. i was angry about that because i really wanted to see something like that. instead, the hospital i went to, we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour. like i've never seen a hospital before! all in all the trip was fun because i at least got to see boston. i had never been on the east coast before and it was really interesting. boston is an amazing city but it is way too chaotic. i had been accepted at boston university and i did not go there because it was way too expensive, and after actually going to boston i was glad that i did not choose to go there. i mean, i love big cities and all, but boston is just way too big. i would lose myself there. so here i am at ut. i am from michigan and my final decision in a school was between ut and uofm. the only reason i came to ut was because my parents moved to dallas a few weeks ago for my dad's job so i figured i might as well come to school here too. being up in michigan with my parents down here just seemed like it was way too far. i am ready to get away but not that far away. texas is so different from michigan. it is really hard to get used to. i have never seen a state show their state flag so much. it is cool, just different. i live in michigan for 17 years and i don't even know what the state flag looks like. everyone down here is really nice though. i like that a lot. i guess it is a southern thing, because people are really eager to talk to you. i can't believe how many people i have met and i have only been here for a week. i like ut a lot and i am glad that i chose this school. i am sure that after time i will feel like a true ut student. i guess that i just need to find my niche in the college scene.

"i don't know how to put my thoughts into words. my mind wonders all the time. i'm really tired. the dog is taking a nap -- i wish i was taking a nap, too. i stayed up too late last night. church was hot and not very interesting. i wonder what time we're leaving today. the houston comets are playing very good. i guess they are still mourning the loss of kim perrot. her death was so sad. where did that crazy dog go now. i bet she went to take a nap in my bed. my typing probably distrubed her. crap! the comets can't score to save their life. good shot. who the heck is that girl. sheryl swoopes is incredibly fast. i wonder why she doesn't get a long with cynthia cooper. pass the ball. rebound. is that a play or what. my sister is being such a baby today. she is so bossy, and when she doesn't get her way, she throws a fit. i never stick up for my brother, but the one time i do, it infuriates her. i can't wait to get back to austin, and i'll stay on my side of town, and she can stay on her side. i won't call her for a couple of days, so she can get completely over her temper tantrum. i hope eryn doesn't call me for a few days. i just want to stay at my dorm and relax and study by myself. this is the stupidest commercial. i hate that buddy lee character. i have to go to the bathroom, but i still have 10 minutes to type. i have got to go on a diet. i'm getting extremely fat. i wonder when that aerobics program gets started. i hope it won't be too hard. i have got to set the vcr to tape my soaps for the week. i hate missing those shows. that girl is such a weiner. she is always getting hurt. i'm getting sick of typing. oh that was a cheap foul. i wonder how they wash there hair when it's in those braids. i bet it stinks. that girl is ugly. he is a horrible dresser. i wonder how much money they make. my watch is rubbing my hand. my eyes are tired. i haven't seen this commercial before. it's kind of dumb. my mind is starting to take a nap. it isn't wondering so much anymore. i hate that when i get in a daze and just stare at people. it's embarrassing. this game is getting boring, i wonder if there are any other games on. when do the cowboys play today. how much more room do i have. i guess i get as much room as i want. cynthia cooper is cocky. why do they wear lipstick when they play. that is retarded. they dress up to get sweaty and work out. i wonder how loud it is in that arena. my head itches. i think someone is driving up to my house. that's a walk! the comets are looking better. is it supposed to rain today. it's pretty cloudy out there. my throat hurts. i wonder if i'm getting sick. man i'm tired. can i ever run out of water in my eyes. every time i yawn my eyes fill completely, and --- the phone is ringing --- i looked at the caller id, but i don't want to talk to that person. i still have to go to the bathroom. well it's been 23 minutes, so i'm going to quit. i hope i did this right.

"what an odd assignment, write about anything for 20 minutes straight. i really like ut but it is so huge, sometimes i wished i had stayed in college station. my boyfriend and friends are still in college station, i was so close to houston and that is were my family resides. its only a hour and a half drive but from austin its an extra 30 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving. my brother is nearby in san marcos and that is only spitting distance from here. while living at home this past summer i didn't like it that much, now i really miss those crazy people i call my family. there was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love. i really need to start working out again because living in austin is making me chubby. you would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking. i have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, i can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow. its our 6 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one. i have known him for about 2 years now and its definitely better to be friends first. my family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways. he is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money. money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it. everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages. what is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in american history. so many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly. its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth. its hard to imagine what i would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way. its hard to think about without getting emotional. i would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, i would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy. its pouring down rain right now, and i hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside. i'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, i definitely feel i'm paying my dues though and hopefully i can do something positive with this college education.

"last week i took a chinese clep test. it started out very well, i understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. as you know, the cantonese language is written in two different formats. one way, the tradition way, was the one i learned since i was a little kid. the other format was a newer, i believe it originated in hong kong or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking"". anyways, i opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. so i spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. then, i decided to just skip through to the end. that is when i figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. ""damn it!"" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. but of course, that was last week, and i already have my results back from the test. i believe i did relatively well. relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. today, monday, is the first day i have been to my rlm biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. i must say, i am completely exhausted. biology discussion was quite an episode. we had an ta that had a really really bad accent. much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. then we took a quiz, which i found to be a bit difficult because i didn't understand teh oral review. i had to buy books today. spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that i probably won't be needing much. i could have found many many other uses for that 129, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. geez, look at my grammar in this essay, i think my english teacher would have a heart attack. psych class was pretty interesting today. dr. pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. i was completely fascinated by the experiment. too bad i can't say the same for my philosophy class. its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. and so i obeyed. i notice that when i'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. but of course, i wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. you can definitely tell at what point in the lecture i crashed. the funniest part is, i lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. i think since i have been here at ut for the fall, i have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. i have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. i worry about other stupid things that i feel the need not to bring up at this moment. however, i have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. i have been recreating too much. this weekend though, we went to barton springs to see a friend that came up to visit us from utsa. barton springs was nothing like i had imagined. i absolutely loved it. everything except the coldass water. then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. it felt like summer again. of course, i had enrolled in the ut summer program. a little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. i miss summer.

"i wish i had a car though, but i think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until i can afford one. but i will always get by, i know. well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so i still have to wake up at 7 am even though i have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. well i didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. that's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her gpa so maybe just maybe she can come to austin and live somewhere around here. i wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. anyway, i'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. it's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 70 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 50 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. just kept on saying ""can you feel that!"" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. i guess that's the focus to my whole life. not sure if that's good or bad or what. probably what got me in trouble last semester when i was half way thru the semester. pretty crazy that i'm my worst enemy, but in a way, i guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if i didn't kick my own butt to do better who would? so i just keep on chugging. i don't know why i'm so success driven? lord knows i'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but i never can seem to do that. try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. oh well. i'll probably grow out of it (please please please). so enough of that, i hope the aggies have lost against fsu because then i get to email my ag friends and laugh. but then again that might not be the greatest idea if the horns don't fair that well this year. don't know what i'm listening to on the radio now. oh yea acdc!! rock on! anyway, i loved that howard stern movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. movies, that's a topic. i love going to see movies. just like the escape i guess. thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with kevin spacy usual suspects, that movie was great. also, that primal fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe. i was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past friday (yes i was a pathetic party pooper but i did manage to do some socializing). anyway i get these movies and come home. now i'm already disappointed because i have this great new tv in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but fox thru a lot of colored snow. so i figure i'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. but noooooo, the vcr is goofed or something. it may have something to do with the tracking, but i don't have the tape anymore so i can't experiment. i'm usually very good which technical things. i knew everything about my first vcr before it came out of the box. but last friday was definately not my day (triple low i've heard it called). but oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (mom's) sauce so that was good. not a complete loss. man i would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. so anyway, i have 5 minutes or so to type. i have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. tell you anything about me? actually, i'm a pretty neat ship keeper; i do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) tv box. but until the cable guy comes on wed. , it'll probably stay there. i have to make sure that i can support my mother beginning this summer because i think she may need it at some point. wish i had a godsent car that would work and then i could probably swing insurance payments and gas, but with car payments it'd be too much. oh my, listening to eye of the tiger, how old is that?!?!?! so, maybe i should just go to sleep after writing this. i need to go see if i can to the pretesting for this class, but i tried before this and couldn't get it to load up. something about the server being down. well, such is life. i think i should do pretty good this semester, shooting for a 4. 0 again. got to stay in head of my brother, we are so competitive, he's a yr behind me but transfered in with a bit more credit than i did, and with leaving mid-semester last yr, he's got a good chance to stay pretty close. times up, bye now!!!

"ah, this is frustrating. seems like i have lost the touch. after all, college is nothing like high school. i'm a mess; i can't pick the beat. somehow, i've fallen behind in my life. pretty much i got to do everything on my own, whereas it used to be people telling me what to do and when to do anything. there was always someone, could be the teacher or mom, constantly laying out the path i should take. now, it's all up to me now. no one can really help. it's my life. is this how adulthood feels like? perhaps, that's just simply a childish question, silly. i can't see what's in front of me, just a big blur, a bit gray. once again, i want to stay as a kid. couple of years ago, our english teacher asked us to write a little journal, ""what age would you stay at, if you get to choose?"" back then, i thought, ""hey, i am going to go through every phase. that's the experience of life; that's the fun. "" now, it doesn't feel so fun. aw, sitting alone in a class of 500 people doesn't seem fun to me. it's funny that i don't have much people to talk to in real life, but there are people online wanting to chat with me, all those high school friends. somehow they managed to stay 24 hours and 7 days online without much difficulty. i talked to one of them last night, just to keep me awake while i tried to figure my calculus homework. he is quite sociable; i suppose. that reminds me my close friend once called me an antisocialist. not that i don't want to interact with people. it's just that they weren't the exact right people i want to share my inner self with. and again, i've only found one person i share almost all my thoughts with. i remember in elementary school, i used to walk home with my best friend. we wouldn't feel awkward or funny even if we didn't talk or make some noise on the way home. it felt secured. but ever since we moved to us, everything changed. no one here holds the same principle i do; i couldn't outpour what i think inside to those people who think my thinking is so odd, and supposedly weird. i still talked to everyone who wanted to chat with me; i just tell them what i really think inside. i made general comments about whatever they said. this close friend who called me an antisocialist actually talked to me on the phone for almost every night for a couple of years. even he called me that. i suppose he never reached inside of me; my best friend thinks i talk too much. funny how both talk to me the equal amount, but they hold the opposite views of me.

"i just got finished with my spanish homework and now i can think in english. i don't really care for spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language. before that i was writing email to friends of mine at other schools. it is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them. if i didn't have email i probably wouldn't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive. i just found out that one of my friend's friend is quitting school. i don't understand that. giving up an education seems ridiculous to me. gold fishes are also ridiculous. my neighbor has oh wait, had two goldfish. one of them died last night. gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish. one minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a pepsi commercial. i now have been writing for five minutes and i wish i could stop looking at the clock. i took a computer assisted english class last semester and i am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience. one of my projects last semester had to do with the tick. he is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures, or nightmares, into the inner workings of his mind, he also has antenna which are referred to as those ""things"" on the cartoon by his cohorts. my little sister likes the tick as well but i don't think she understands alot the humor in it, most of its pretty stupid i will admit. my sister just learned how to say her abc's in spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone. the way she says ""w"" is really cute. my brother just got married this past summer and i don't know what to think of his wife, she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange. but i am not really a judge of strange since i have been called that myself a time or two. actually i think everyone is called strange, or weird, at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing. like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend, when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card, or package of candy. ten minutes. it is amazing how often people look at the clock. my batteries went dead awhile back and i don't really miss it very much, granted i took my sister's mickey mouse watch every now and then, in fact i think it is my room right now, but time often feels insistent and that can be stressful. kind of like how i have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment. my calf muscles are incredibly sore and i have been complaining about them all day. my roommate said that i shouldn't complain because i was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday. well i was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much, if i had know that this was how i was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice. 15 minutes. the mtv movie awards are on tonight and i don't know if i really want to watch them or not. its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are, i get enough of that with going to school here, just kidding. i will probably watch it anyway. my neighbors are pretty cool, even the one with minus on fish. i sure hope it didn't die because she didn't feed it, or over fed it. i don't see the purpose of a goldfish, i like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish, even though that is disgusting. i just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla, but now it is bob. what ever happened to quesadilla i will never know. i guess my dad and mom just couldn't hang with a name that made no sense. well it made sense to me, because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant, and they have the best quesadillas there. 20 minutes.

"in fact i always think about her whenever i have a spare moment. she is in my every thought. she is so far away from me, yet in my heart she is so close. i read some poetry tonight, love sonnets, and all i could think about was her. she is so beautiful. i long for the next time i can see her. it seems like only yesterday we met for the first time. i talk about her constantly to all my friends to the point, where they are either sick of hearing about her, or know her almost as well as i do. i know it's not the best thing to go through, but i am seem to be sad all the time. not literally, or maybe literally, but it is hard to explain. i love her more then life itself, but i ""hate"" her for leaving me. not really hate, but i don't know how to explain it, but more like i guess a little dislike. nothing i can't handle, i just wish she was here with me. it doesn't seem fair. i see all of my friend's with their significant others, and they are next to each other always. sharing all the ""special"" moments in their lives, but i have to wait at least a week, before i can call her. the bill is too expensive otherwise. i beg her to come back, knowing full and well, that she can't do that, but it seems to help but sometimes hurt at the same time. she is so special to me, and i can wait forever for her. most people think that is absurd, but she is my everything. being sad a lot i know is to a degree not healthy, but what can i do. the moment she walked down the corridor in the airport, i heart stopped smiling. since that gloomy day in june, a part of me has been gone. although i smile on the outside, on the inside i am sad. the day her sweet embrace takes me in, only then can i smile. that day is not too far away, and i long for it. i guess this is the best part of being sad, because i feel better thinking about the future, the only thing is that it is a type of perpetual loop. as soon as i think about the future and being with her, i get sad again thinking that i have to wait another few months. then i think about all the times that i will be ""alone"" without her. as much as my friends are great, i have none really. she is my one and only true friend. i have some friends, i. e. my roommate, and a several other people that genuinely care, but most of them don't. i have pretty much stopped ""trying"" to be there as much as i have in the past. i feel that i am only a friend in the convenience of someone else. i feel that they only come to talk to me when they need something, or when something is wrong for them. i used to try so much, but in the past month's i have stopped trying. that may not be the answer, but it is something that i have come to. i tell all my friends that if they do need me, then i will be there for them. i called to see how my friends were. i paged them telling the just a simple ""hello"". calling them randomly just to check if everything was cool. and that favor was never really returned. so, now i don't care as much. i am still there if someone needs me. i could never abandon a friend. i care too much about people for that. all of this leads me back to my girlfriend. she is the one person that always cares about how i am feeling. she always knows when something is wrong or bothering me. she always wants to take care of me and love me. and for that i return the feelings back 10x over. i love her and i don't want anything ever to happen to her, so i check with her as much as i can. she is some kind of special and i can't let her go. she is too good to me. it's moments like these where i get to feel better about my situation, because i know everything will be fine in the ""end"", but at this moment in my life, i am not so much worried about the ""end"" as the now. maybe worried isn't the best word. i just wish she was here to spend time with me. so we could eat dinner together, go see a movie together, to study together, to love together. all the couple things and all the friend things. it just seems unfair, and then there are points like now, where i miss her like crazy and i think i am going to go nuts without her. i know i can be strong and i can surpass this and the end will be that much sweeter. so with that in mind, i can end this ""journal"" entry on a good note and feel good about everything.

" how necessary is sleep? the past few days, i have been going to morning swim practice and then my 8 a. m. classes. is only four to five hours enough? i know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. but is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. right now i am feeling somewhat tired, but know that i have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will i get use to this kind of sleep cycle. also i wonder if i am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. are my notes as good as they should be or should i be taking more during class? i write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do i need more details in order to do well. the past few days i have recieved two different parking tickets, that i thought were unnecessary. i double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. the signs indicated that i wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if i could find a spot. but after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, i guess i now have to pick a different location. i wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. i wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. the front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. this is mainly because of the lack of evidence that i have, which i think is incredibly stupid.

"assignment 1 it is 12:00 am and my mind is very tired. it has been a very long and exhausting day, and i can't believe this is only the second day of class, i have a long way to go, hopefully ill be able to handle it. it seems as if i don't feel like thinking, my mind feels lazy as if it has been asleep this whole summer--i need to wake it up and make it start thinking again--like i did back in highschool. --or at least back before my senior year when i didn't really do much thinking at all. i hope tomorrow goes good and i am able to get all the stuff i need to get done. i'm kind of worried that i am not going to be able to manage my time while i'm here--like sitting here right now at midnight where no one knows where i am, kind of scares me. i have the freedom to do what i want now, and i hope i can still make myself do all the things i need to. i am also worried right now--walking back late at night by myself. it scares me to think of what might happen to me. but some things have to get done, and you just have to do them. i really would like to go to sleep right now, i think my tiredness is interferring with my ability to think about this writing assignment. maybe i should have waited until i was a little bit more awake. or maybe, i think better when i am tired. i don't know. my mind is blank right now, and i am feeling a little anxious that i am not writing what i need to be writing about,and that some how who ever is reading this will not give me credit because i didn't follow the assignment. i wish i could go home and sleep in my bed and my house, i am getting a little bit homesick. i already miss my family at home and all my friends. it gets lonely up here, when you don't really know to many people, sometimes i feel like i don't belong here and that what i am majoring in is totally wrong for me. i feel like i won't be able to handle calculus and some of my hard classes. but, i know i have to. i don't really have a choice right now--i have to at least finish out this semester and see how things go. i hope my roomate isn't worried about me, she left here about and hour ago and i told her i would be there in a little while. oh well, she probably just fell asleep or something. i am feeling kind of anxious right now--i don't think i like being here by myself--i don't know what it is. i feel anxious a lot--i should stop worrying about things so much. well the 20 minutes is up. the end ",1,-0.071461 0.062461 1.069696 -0.167391 0.649396 -0.948397 -1.163658 -0.641692 -1.161503 -0.567726 -0.079087 -0.590446 -0.625806 0.76209 -1.046139 0.0 -0.04277 0.599589 1.584026 -0.795527 1.457042 -0.142363 -0.952358 -0.525469 -0.624052 -1.128097 -0.509307 -0.066102 0.121908 -0.608013 -1.100231 1.235429 0.85902 3.938108 -1.017959 0.348981 1.252996 -0.999456 0.961675 0.568258 1.168824 0.30047 0.151904 0.116607 -0.597865 -1.199533 2.462423 -1.629534 -1.261211 -1.269217 -1.021225 1.275856 -0.656859 1.457227 0.495807 -0.242845 -0.728157 -0.954251 0.764465 -1.64575 0.313995 -1.209833 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.642529 0.222441 0.114989 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 4.65893 -0.422267 -0.062062 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.152785 5.074362 4.684212 5.148917 5.642049 3.826041
"i am very famished right now. i just got back from the psychology class. my stomach is gnawing, and i feel the grinding emotions. i haven't been very energetic the whole day. i almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. this is terrible, because i have never really gotten that tired in high school before. it always just seemed to be the calculus class that i almost fall asleep in. i am very frustrated at school. it is not only that i am a freshman, and that i am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. for example, i have a biology class, with an excellent professor. however, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. he is indian, and i am sure he must be very intelligent, but i cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. i understand him on that basis, because i am after all a foreign student, and 4 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. but i guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. anyway, i was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. i understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. after all, we are just as confused. math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. but math has always been a tough area of subject for me. i have a bad history of math, and therefore i think that class is prone to my exhaustion. my professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. i know that it is mind over matter, and that if i try to psyched myself to like math, i could probably get to put my energy into it. don't get me wrong. i have always been a good student. i was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in dallas. however, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and i tend to procrastinate. this in the end results in my fears now. i am getting so nervous every day, because i am behind in my reading of assignments, and i am worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. i also noticed that i not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. i can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and i guess everything seems to distract me. also, i have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, i thought it is where one may start for me. i often find myself looking out for guys. even if i do get into one, i am sure that i will not do anything to jeopardize my future. i really want to be a doctor, and i am right now very worried about medical school. i really want to enter harvard, and i am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. i guess i am being irrational here, but i did harbor the hope that i could get in because of the deferral. but that stumbling block will not trip me, i will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 4. 0 gpa, and hopefully a high mcat score, and hope that i can apply to harvard and get into med school. that would be a very nice, ultimate dream that i would ever want to fulfill. i am very hungry right now, and i am having a major headache trying to think if i should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. i think i will visit my advisor on friday.

" right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me. i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week. i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a,little more hard core than its been. i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something. this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i don't know what is so weird about it. i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy's which is good but its not what i wanted. when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw. i don't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it. you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way. now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something. i think my cd is over now. no its not. i don't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying. oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd. my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one. maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one. i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something. oh well she can live. im really tired and its only like 9:45. probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning. this song is definitely the best on this cd. i love dave matthews- i've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome. ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then. that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there. not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway. it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener. i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random. is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything? i don't think so- so oh well. my knee hurts. i think i should ice it or soemthing but i don't have an ice pack. i guess ill have to get that sometime. an ice pack and sweet tea. if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later. this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea. you can't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp be nasty. i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria? i guess it doesnt matter. i miss the italian food from up there so much. i can't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there. not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time? i need more pasta. penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created. i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something. you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here. or maybe its just me. i doubt it. ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in. hmm. im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something. haha how funny would that be? and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this. im so ",1,-0.08082 -0.508403 -1.513696 -0.577379 -0.842741 1.278382 -0.126861 -0.583899 -0.832899 1.068107 -0.099942 0.492286 -1.489375 -0.76383 -0.693859 0.0 -0.04277 -1.026003 -1.833319 -0.795527 -2.148523 2.048221 -1.044445 0.138174 -0.24344 -0.46341 0.305102 -0.063167 0.608764 0.721564 -0.851271 -0.458272 0.118319 -0.906028 0.383684 -0.577365 0.363201 0.897285 -0.083999 -0.12369 0.974448 3.098199 -0.505368 -0.237529 -1.202003 -0.791674 -0.661113 -1.179804 -0.904327 -0.577959 -0.990492 -0.384888 -0.66439 -0.79714 0.252351 2.030849 0.167186 1.746262 0.753802 0.982454 0.37247 0.108351 -0.480161 -0.455387 0.029685 1.560793 -0.086094 -0.6248 -1.313497 0.132788 -0.23436 0.173691 -0.37208 2.852195 -0.422267 -1.107569 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.058744 4.508684 3.621963 4.477402 4.379385 4.704445
"ok, so my grandfather died yesterday. why don't i feel sad yet. what is wrong with me, do i have no conscionce? when my mother told my sister and i, she told us like we should pitty her, not like we should also be sad, what the f*** he was my grandfather. it was all about her, when can you come down to houston to watch the animals, so i can go to the funeral, not, do you wnat to come with me to the funeral? how can she possible be so selfish. but then look at me, i am so busy being angry, i haven't had a chance to be sad yet. what if i don't get sad? is that bad? am i a bad person? i only saw him once every couple of years, if that. i didn't really know him, and when i did see him he was very generous, but also a real jerk. his intensions were always really good, but he always was very bosy and rude. i remember once when i was like 8 we went out to eat, and he yelled at the waitress because they didn't seat us fast enough. but, last year when he came to my graduation we went out to eat . oh had a thought. my sister and i were thinking about him the night before he died. thinking about how he is always so concerned with us, like for example, he always focused in on something important to us, like when i was a vegitarian he always sent we cook books and when i danced he always called me his little princess or his little ballerina. this continued for years, he never forgot. . when we went out to eat for my graduation he was so polite to the waiter, and even joked with him ",1,-1.590362 -0.630811 -0.64033 0.151881 0.291026 -1.632559 -0.84137 1.637439 0.7661 -1.366709 -0.149843 2.825316 0.585913 0.655191 -0.853286 0.0 -0.04277 2.057256 -0.67655 4.38753 0.467714 0.264714 3.923274 0.366621 0.543487 -0.400682 -0.400888 -0.216165 -0.326487 -2.048092 -1.100231 -1.430891 1.776325 -0.906028 0.824715 2.154281 -0.489004 0.224612 -0.569494 -0.344046 -1.038726 -1.708119 3.250534 1.543734 1.362309 0.185081 -0.430327 3.065156 -0.416892 4.620246 -0.800207 2.72333 3.239157 -1.867157 -0.318088 -1.384335 -1.538191 0.426397 -0.482042 -0.746464 0.424517 -1.600134 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.697776 2.082618 -0.073676 -0.23436 2.388819 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.708079 -0.451544 1.345555 0.478269 4.910823 4.19186 4.873445 4.383463 5.450026

"i am typing this paper because i have to. my roommate is asleep. i am listening to incubus music. i am listening to incubus. i just got off the phone with my girlfriend. she was annoying me. she was saying all this stuff about how i was flirting with this fat girl. and i was like what i did not flirt with the fat girl. and we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. but in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. the music i am listening to is so good i love listening to them. i am so mad. i did my calculus homework tonight and i missed a few problems. it makes me angry because my roommate and i both know calculus and i should have gotten them all right. i missed a few which was stupid, but i corrected them. but still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. if you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -100 to a 100 which makes no sense. i am so mad at this stupid grading system. because then i can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. i am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. and i messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. i cannot wait for this week to be over. i am having a bad week. the song i am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. i really have to go to the bathroom. i wish i could go. oh well, the music is good. i really like this writing assignment because i can write about whatever i want. i wish all writing assignments were like this. it is so cool to be able to write about anything. i love writing about what i am thinking, it is almost like a diary. it is good to be able to write about my feelings, i think this assignment is very good. i hope my girlfriend is not mad, i just thought about that. we talked tonight, and i think she might be mad with some of the stuff that i told her. i really hope she is not because i love her with all my heart, i hope she is nor going to blow anything ",0,0.461474 -0.63145 1.161808 -0.222414 0.54061 -1.657154 -0.059467 0.296853 -0.277482 -0.798712 -0.181187 -0.590446 -0.926471 1.589775 0.535422 0.0 -0.04277 1.570491 0.570872 1.302431 0.953049 0.616429 0.133641 2.626253 -0.624052 0.274117 -1.481744 0.057404 2.025282 0.519622 0.445375 0.078674 2.170696 -0.906028 3.954465 0.541946 -0.284547 1.370643 -0.764948 0.238332 -0.205508 -0.95456 0.086643 0.467227 -1.429535 1.95404 0.248657 0.648791 1.962068 0.597126 -0.609248 -1.673107 0.591361 1.17181 0.475559 -1.940184 -0.938569 -0.022837 1.240086 -1.595503 -0.66385 -1.158189 -0.480161 1.054039 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.272355 -0.62463 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.022802 -0.422267 -1.674882 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.96917 4.113835 4.93011 3.63374 4.195257 4.586839
" stream of thought. this is interesting because it seems like i've done this many times on my own. keeping a journal of things i'm feeling or things that have been on my mind, but i can never quite finish a thought before another one pops into my mind. i've been at the chi o house for almost 2 hours today, but wait- instead of studying at the chi o house i spent those 2 hours trying to save an apartment for myself and 3 friends next year. that didn't work because you can't forget to speak to your father when it comes to issues of money (whether it's his money or your own). i'm a little frustrated because i haven't been able to get my computer hooked up to the ethernet service at hardin house yet. ok, very frustrated. i'm even using my roommate's computer at the moment. not that that is a bad thing, but hey, maybe i want to use my own computer! oh well- she's never here anyway. i kind of like it bc she has all of her classes in the morning and mine are pretty much spread out through the entire day, so we don't see each other that much. it keeps us from getting sick of each other, and we still find the other person amusing when we do spend time together. on the other hand, my best friend from high school- i'm about to scream! i was so hoping that when i came to ut, a school of collosal size, that it might be possible for me to get away from westlake; branch out; make some new friends; have some new experiences. while all this is taking place, i still seem to have this tie to my high school- her name is robin. she hadn't always planned on coming to ut. as a matter of fact, she wanted to go to baylor with our friend blair (robin is my closest friend, but i kind of wish she had gone to baylor) but one day she just made up her mind and here we are. still summer and robin or robin and summer . . why can't i just be my own person??? i enjoy having time to myself. don't get me wrong, i am a very outgoing person- i love to meet new people- i even want to dual major in public relations (and photography), but sometimes it's nice to just not have to talk to anyone. to just be alone. this thing with robin has gotten out of hand! now that she's seen how much fun i had going through rush she wants to rush next year. now that she knows i'm going to do young life leadership she wants to do yl leadership. i drive her to church every morning and then to her house afterwards (it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of the way. but she's my friend, so i do it). i'm signing up to do texas angels next year, so she's going to sign up to be an angel. and the list goes on. i can understand that yeah she may actually be interested in these things- and i'm so glad she's wanting to be involved in things like young life and lake hills church (which meets at our high school by the way) but i need some air. it's even gotten to the point where i actually feel guilty if i hang out with'make new friends! that's not right!!! the thing is i know i need to just talk to her and let her know what i'm thinking (maybe not to the full extent) but she has a right to know how spending so much time together is hurting our friendship more than helping it. i just hate to hurt her feelings. it'll work out. i can't believe i'm writing all these thoughts down for other people to see. i'm assuming other people will read this because it's an assignment, but hey. stream of consciousness eh? :) i've recently been reading this book called when god writes your love story and i wish i could spend more time reading it to get it finished. it's really interesting, although often cheezy, but it talks about god being the center of your life and the center of your relationship with members of the opposite sex. the thing that hits me most strongly is when it talks about how instead of pursuing relationships, we should give this area to god and let him pick out our partner for us. i've known that god has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting god bring him to me. i know he will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually finish the book! :) and that's another thing- i have not been keeping up with my quiet times recently! not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know? it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes! they are all soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one! and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 8am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not like i go out and party (and i don't ever have hangovers then bc i just plain don't drink at all) but i'm such a night person! actually i dont' know what the deal is. ever since middle school i haven't gone to bed before midnight and now that's more like 2am. but no matter what time i go to sleep early or late, i cannot for the life o fme wake up the next morning. it's an impossibility. time is almost up i wish there was more time to write though. oh well.

"my mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking of my roommate's mouse on her computer. it just keeps going and going and going. then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. i have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. i hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. he died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. now i'm thinking about lunch. which i was supposed to have an hour ago. yet, it is very upsetting because i have no food in the dorm in which i want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. i'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit austin from houston this friday. he'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. that will be quite exciting considering that i haven't had any great food in a long time. i'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where i moved from. this weekend i'll be going to see my parents. when i think of my parents, i get a guilty feeling because i know i haven't been very truthful to them. but, there are just things that i can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. it makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, i don't really miss them yet because i feel restricted in their presence. the sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. maybe because i just took a shower. my body feels warm and clean. i love that feeling. the sound of food is calling. but i need to type for another 15 minutes. for some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. the thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that i have an extreme hatred for insects. the thought of them makes me itch. now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. writing continuously makes me tired. speaking of sleepiness, i think of the experiment we did on monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. i was one of the control group people who just sat there. sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. i fell asleep soon after that. then i woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that i left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because i had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. it wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that i drooled all over myself. not a good image. speaking of image, i went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. it felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. usually i am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and ""mingle,"" but yesterday i needed to because it was a ""rush"" event. i am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something i really want to do because i'm not the extremely social type. however, as for now, i will keep on rushing to see how things go. it makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because i know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. it already makes him nervous enough to know that i'm up here at the populated university of austin, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. so, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. but like everyone's advice to me: don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. maybe this is why they gave me the advice. because every time i go to some party or meet new people, i feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. i suppose i get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. however, i am still determined to make this relationship work. now i am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. one more minute to go. i see einstein on my computer screen. he makes me want to do well in school. i hope i will do well this year. i feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but i suppose i'll learn to handle it.

"i want to listen to more music. i don't know what song to download next. but oh well. i love listening to music when i study. i wonder why? i like listening to rock and alternative. that is weird i guess. most people would listen to classical or other soothing music. but i like studying to louder, cooler music. i guess that makes me weird. i wonder how things are going at home. i want to go back this weekend, but i know that i can't. i have a lot of work i want to do, and i really want to finish my calculus before the due date. i should sign up for tutoring down at jester. so far the class has been ok though. i understand what the teacher is saying, and i am not having that much trouble with my homework. i hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend. but i know that he is going to be really busy with his internship. he has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work. i guess i may be asking to much of him. i don't want to pressure him to come, so maybe i won't mention it. i still wish he could come though. i wonder how molina is doing? she is like 5 months already. she is getting pretty big. i wonder if she knows that natalie is having twins. so many girls are pregnant back home, that is kinda sad. most of them are really smart, and they could have done so much with their lives. i'm cold. i wish i could turn of the air conditioner. well, at least it's better than it being hot. norma still hasn't figured out how to turn off her alarm yet. it keeps beeping every hour. it is getting on my nerves. i wonder if i take the batteries out if she would mind. i'm thirsty. i should get some water. but i don't want water, but that is all i have. i need to get a job. i don't know how i am going to pay for the spring semester. i can barely pay for the housing as it is. i need more money. i hope everything is going ok at the ranch. we need the place to do better, or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school. i don't want to quit, but if it comes down to one of us having to leave, then i would rather it be me. my brother is doing well, and my sister only has a year to go. i have only barely started, i can wait a bit longer to go to school. till then, i can help out at home, and work with my parents at our restaurant. my foot went to sleep. i should move so it can wake up. i have so much work to do today. i need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class. i wonder how my friends are doing in class. i want to see vanessa. she should have told me that she got married 2 weeks ago. she said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married. that is a stupid reason. how can someone forget that they had gotten married? i won't get mad though. i am happy for her. i wonder if manny will ever ask me to marry him. sure we have talked about it, and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together, but still. knowing him, he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because i could say no. it is just like when he wanted to ask me out. i knew he liked me and he knew i liked him, but he couldn't ask me. so i finally made him ask me. i said,? we are not going anywhere until you ask me. ? so he finally did. i hope him asking me to marry him won't be the same way. that is definitely not how i picture my future husband proposing. well my time is almost up, but i need to keep going. norma is back in the room. she can never get her days straight. she just left again. i guess she is going to the bathroom. wow, time is almost really up. time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking. i think that is really cool. oh well. my time is up now. but i am still thinking. i have pretty much said my life's story, that is really weird. i thought all i would put down was how my day had gone. you know, like a lot of crap just to fill up space. i should stop now because i have a lot more things to do. i think i will stop now.

" so. stream of consciousness, right. well, i'm in the computer lab right now because i didn't want to do this on my home computer which is pretty messed up at the moment. i don't feel like writing about it. it's quiet in here, and the computers are quite nice. all i hear are the tapping of keyboards. tap tap tap. and what else? i don't nkow. i wish i was doing this in my room so i could be listening to music. the flaming lips which i'm especially into right. i recently bought zaireeka, a fusion of the words zaire and eureeka by them but haven't been able to play it yet. it's a kind of confusing record i guess is the word to talk about. but i've still got like 16 minutes so why not? it's a 4 cds played in unision concept record by the flaming lips. wayne coyne says it's supposed to be about chaos and inspiration or something. it makes sense, trust me. but when i got people over to play it with me (you need 4 cd players and 4 people who want to help play and listen to it with you to play it) it was all chaos and no inspiration. no one really had more than passing curiosity, and when it wasn't going all that smoothly people gave up quickly. but yeah, i still want to play it, just need some people with passion? to hear it with me. what else? blah blah blah. i can't think of anything to write about. 933 934 i'm almost halfway done. some people are talking in another language across from me now. i don't nkow what language. oh, now they're leaving. i think they're indian? so what language does that mean they speak?? i just wrote a sentence and deleted it. i think maybe you're not supposed to do that? don't think it really matters. man, i think this assignment is kind of too long. ten minutes would've been enough. all these people are leaving around me. they're going outside into the sunshine. and i'm staring at this screen. i just spent a while trying to figure out how to do that prescreening stuff too. i registered but then i couldn't find a link anywhere on the site that led to the actual survey. what's up with that? i emailed wendy or whoever. got to remember to do that later now. prescreening survey. do it before sep 9 i think. that's like 1. 5 hours credit. we've hit the fifteen minute mark, friends. that makes this the homestretch. that's sports lingo. not that i know anything about sports. man, that football game yesterday was annoying. it brings out all the rowdy yelling people in the streets. and it's so crowded, you know? i hate it when it gets so crowded on campus, i dread going through it. so many people! why did i go to a school with fifty thousand students? i'm spelling out the numbers now, did you notice? because why rush? no reason, that's why. type tyep type. stream. of. conscious. yep, that's what i'm doing. almost done. nineteen minutes complete, one minute to go. come on, so close. i'm so close to being outside away from the flourescent li ",0,-0.828618 -0.207572 -0.2303 -0.677608 0.022885 -3.411901 0.432372 1.018213 -0.038655 -0.351887 -0.25023 1.904545 0.262334 -1.866803 0.642143 0.0 -0.04277 -0.9909 -1.335027 -0.517127 -1.547815 0.609975 -0.887142 -0.062195 0.630195 -0.189053 0.212675 1.24451 -1.114964 -0.302447 -0.690027 -0.228975 -1.277262 0.064472 -0.028198 -1.109326 -0.302882 0.388952 -0.599162 -0.623589 -0.375317 -0.3001 -0.637348 -0.542403 -1.429535 0.932074 -0.381077 -0.272915 0.690234 -0.858015 1.589963 -0.760551 0.398557 -1.132952 -1.205458 0.394194 0.392727 -0.954251 0.164221 0.148115 -0.415905 -1.248257 -0.480161 -0.267683 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.940452 0.234534 -0.073676 -0.23436 3.577125 -0.153508 -0.337085 -0.422267 1.752509 0.611666 -0.09467 1.586181 4.178423 3.33415 4.427942 4.441286 5.107626
"""antisocial""--that is what it said in large letters as i walked into my dorm room today. everyone on my floor thinks i am antisocial. i hate the way that people do not ever understand the difference between anitsocial and shy. i wish that people would just to understand people more and hate them less. i guess it is partially my fault. i long to meet new people and make new friends but i spend all of my time locked in my room talking to all of my old freinds that are hundrends of miles away. they are all coming to visit me tomorrow for my 19th birthday. lots of them are coming. i guess it will at least show all of the jerks on my floor that i am not as ""anitsocial"" as they think i am. they are all so stupid anyway. all they do is get drunk every single night. how can they think so highly of themselves living that way. when do they ever study? the true is that i am jealous of them, i have always wanted to be so carefree and fun. but, i would never pick on anyone, ever! i guess i could go out and party everynight, but that just isn't me. i would fell silly if i ever went to one of those wild parties. besides, i am going to be a doctor, i need to stay and study. it makes me sick to imagine the possibility of not getting into medical school, it is my dream, the only thing i really want. but, i am not the most desipined student, i love to slack off and sit and play on aol. i will never get into a good medical school and then i will be lost, it is the scariest thing i have ever had to face. it is so scary that i try to protect myself. i am a diehard romantic and it is amazing that in my lowest moments i think about marrying ty in order to secure my future. ty is my ex-boyfreind that i would never be happy with but i in the business honors program and wil surely be rich someday. i often think that if i marry him then it will be okay if my medical school falls through. i know it would be stupid but i think it at times. what i really want is someone to sweep me off my feet, like in the movies. i love okd black and white mushy romantic movies more than anything in the world. the are so sweet and beautiful and you can always tell that they will never fall out of love and that they really will live happily ever after. such a nice thought. i guess i cna't ask for a fairy tale but i know that i will never get a divorce. never! i was always so proud growing up that my parents never divorced. i always thought that it somehow made me better than everyone, like i had something to do with it. well, the last day of school on my sophmore year my mom called me into the living room and told me she was moving out. i thought i was going to die. the effects of this event have been bothering me ever since. i am so clingy now with guys i date that i drive them insane. i have this unbelievable fear of being left by those i love, and i wwent through a phase were i cried everyday for a year. i am going to be a much better parent to my kids than most. i am going to sing to them and show them hapy movies and take them to museums and plays and play games with them. i will puch them to be wonderful, but not too much. and i will make sure that every moment of their lives they know how much i love them. i can't wait to have children. i do worry thought. sometimes even the best parents can't always innfluence their kids to be good. tonight ty is taking me out for dinner. i invited my roommate to come with us, she said she would and i feel bad because i think it hurt his feelings that i asked her. i just can't help it. even in high school i would invite the band director that everyody hated to walk around with us in disney world. he looked so lonely walking by himself. i hope i find someone to appricate me being like that.

"i already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. unfortunately, when i tried to submit it, it didn't work. there was some sort of error and now i am having to redo the entire thing. so basically, i simply feel frustrated that i have to redo this assignment when i could be using my time for something much more useful than this. beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. i am currently trying to decide what i am going to do with the rest of my life. i feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! my decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. my career choice will determine what kind of people i meet and what kind of contribution i make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. it is important to me that i make a good decision. for this reason, i feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. i want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. i suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. after all, isn't the most important thing that i am satisfied with my job? the opinions of others shouldn't influence me. and yet, i want people to think that i am intelligent. i can't help it. that is just the way i am. perhaps i have a bit more of peter keating and a bit less of howard roark in my than i would like. another important factor is the value of my work. i would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. for example if i were a microbiologist, i could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. another important factor is money. i would like to say that money isn't important. however, this is a lie. i want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. i want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. i want to be able to go on vacations every year. i want to see the world. of course i need someone to have fun with while i do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if i went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. the underlying point here is that i want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. if these were the only criteria, i think i could find a job fairly easily. the real clincher is the next criterion. i want to enjoy my job. i know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. however, i don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that i am going to hate. i don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. i don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. i am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so i want to make sure i enjoy it. not only do i want to enjoy it, i want to make sure i choose the career that i will enjoy the most. perhaps this is the reason that i find it so difficult to make a career decision. i feel as though i am currently being productive in my career quest. i added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if i might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. if not, i have determined that i should remain in the college of natural science because that is where i will find a courseload that interests me the most. surely if i choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary.

" well i finally found the website for this place, and now im not really sure what to say. im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. im also very angry at my roommate katie right now. sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. i signed up for an experiment thing in my csd class, and i have no idea where the room is! all it said was totten and the time and i have no idea what that means. i hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. oh i also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. i almost forgot! the ink on my hand is already wearing off, i should go write down the time on paper when im done with this. i really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. but its cool because i want to major in communications. the lady from there never called me back! i should call her again soon. well maybe i can get the application online or something. i wonder whats going on with the guys next door. they're always coming over here to say hi. i think im going to ask vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. poor kris. i can't believe hes sick now because of me! i hope hes feeling better. this chair is really nice! yesterday was pretty scary, i get really nervous about stuff like that. the bells at the tower were really pretty though when they were playing god bless america. i guess its a pretty historical moment, and im glad i was here for that. even though this wasnt my first choice i guess its ok. its kind of big, but maybe i need that. wow its been 8 minutes already. i don't know if this is due by 5 today. wait what is today. ok i ha 3 classes so its thursday and oh ok sept 13. thats tomorrow. this is crazy. i should get started on that map too. i wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. yeah i bet it does. why else would i be writing it. i think it said it was going to give me a printout of what i wrote and something else too. an analysis? i don't think a computer could do that. wow tomorrow is friday already yay i get to see all my friends back home! i have to go see peter and see how forbidden gardens is! he said hes still going to work there until the end of the year i think. i wonder what college he'll end up going to. he could get into princeton, i hope he does. if not hs coming to ut so that'll be cool. uh i can't believe this morning! im so mad at her! i wonder when shes getting back! should i act mad or just let it go? its probably better if i tell her. yeah i will. i think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. i guess im doing that. kind of just whatever pops into my head. oh feelings. wasnt i supposed to write about my surroundings too. i hate messing up and having to backspace! well i still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because i had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. i wonder what chapter im supposed to be on for this class. oh man chapter 2. ok well i have 1 done so that shouldnt be too hard. those notes took me forever! i need to think of a faster way. well i could highlight like in my geography book, but i think i might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. i hope nothing happens today! thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. its hard to type out all my feelings because i think faster than i type, so as soon as i think something, i start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. plus i think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe im not really recording exactly how i think. hmm. gosh im hungry. that breakfast was really good this morning! i thought it was going to be weird since i went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. thier theirselves. that doesnt look right. hey i have 45 seconds left. uh! as soon as i finished writing that the time was already off. this is annoying. ok well i guess im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what i actually wrote nonstop for 20minutes.

" i just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so i could read the things i need to read for my classes. the shower sure did wake me up! a girl living on my floor, whom i have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. so it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. this anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. so now i am here, listening to music and writing my stream of consciousness because i figured that this would be the best time since i have multiple feelings in me right now. in addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. he recently is taking a break with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. i told him, yeah, i know what you mean. i had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual. so instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. it took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. talking about them just made me a little sad. like i said, the break was really bad, so bad that i felt like there was no one who could understand what i was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. anyway, i tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. if only i could help him out with his sadness, but i know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. a break from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. i am content that i have no one tying me down, but i do miss the boyfriend'girlfriend relationship. if i do meet someone, then that is fine. if i do not, then that is fine too. when i entered college i promised myself that i would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. a huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. i have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud! there are plenty of fish in the sea. yes, college is great so far; i recently joined kung fu. it feels so good to be doing something you love again. i had to quit due to, once again, strict parents, but now that i'm back in the sport, the stress is less. i love watching it, and there are really athletic people in the class too. martial arts has always been a big interest to me. to be one of the few girls in the kung fu class is another bonus. not only am i surrounded by athletic guys, i also feel like i am special in a way, like i am unique. and i am better than most of the guys already. flexiblity and grace is key in wu shu kung fu, and i've got them both.

"today has been pretty easy. that girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least i am out of there. for once, i actually do not have a headache yet. and it's already almost noon. i wish i didn't have to go to work today. it's not that i don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. most of the people are nice. i wish i didn't have to stand up all the time, though. my back itches. it is really hot in my room. lately, it has been freezing in here. it is probably because i am sitting right by the window. this assignment is really making me tired. however, i actually got almost 8 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. maybe that is why i don't have a headache yet. tonight, though, i need to go to the gym and work out. i have only worked out once since i've been here. i think i am getting out of shape, even though i seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. oh well, it's not like i'm overweight or anything. i am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. it used to make me sick for the first few days i was here. my neck itches now. i think it is moving! oh my goodness i can't wait until this weekend. i finally get to go home and eat some normal food. most of all, i get to see chris. i miss him so much. i'm not really lonely all the time without him, but i am never really happy like i used to be. but after i see him for a few days and have to leave him again, i am sure i'll be pretty lonely. it makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. now my head itches. my back hurts. i haven't had a massage since i've been here. that would be so nice. anyways, i just ate a nasty lunch and i feel kind of nauseous. yuck. dinner tonight is mexican food and i think i'll walk to the union to eat. i am really tired now. this type of writing seems to put me into a trance. i feel like i need to take a nap now. i don't think that is possible though, since i have to be at work in about 45 minutes. at least that is the last thing i have to do today. i don't think i even have any homework. maybe i'll take a nap after work. well, actually, i need to call chris after work. maybe i'll take a nap after that. the room seems like it has cooled off a lot. maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. my neck and back are so stiff. i want to lay down so bad but i know that if i do, i'll probably fall asleep. my roommate slept in this morning. that was a good idea. i can't wait to see chris. this weekend should be so much fun. i get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. i haven't seen my parents in 3 weeks. i know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. i need to email her. i need to email chris too. i wonder what brian is up to. maybe i should call him. i don't think i will because he is probably in class and i really don't want to talk to his roommate. speaking of roommates, i need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. i have no idea what she is talking about. oh well. my twenty minutes in finally over. i think i will go lay down.

"i'm sitting here typing again i've got a lot to do today i want to get all of my work done soon so i don't have to worry about anything this weekend but i probably will anyway cause i always do. i wish i was a speed reader like on this movie i once saw -my stepmother's an alien- where the alien just stuck her arm in a book and in a matter of minutes she understood the entire content. if i could do that i would have so much free time to write and draw and relax . i'm sure though that there are people who read slower than me. so maybe i should feel lucky. my wrists hurt again. and my head hurts kind of dizzy tiredness that i have to day from of course not sleeping enough last night. was on the phone instead because some times- especially when your tired and missing your friends- it feels like the right decision to sacrifice sleep for conversational anecdotes. but in the morning and now i feel it may have been a mistake i'll feel better tomorrow. after i sleep it will be nice to see paul tomorrow. justin is so funny -all the porn off his computer sticks in my head its so plastic- i wonder if anyone a long time a go ever thought that sex would be reduced to a computer graphic. its an ironic opposite maybe people are slowly changing- they are- to be more electronically oriented- i wont be one of them though i will stand alone. mr. purdy too, he always talked about how overindustrialized the world has become and how it will eventually change back like in a cycle to the way it used to be- primitive. but i think his optimism is held up by a false sense of security most likely brought about by his memories as a child of a life with out computers . me on the other hand, they've surrounded me since birth so i cant see his 'cycle' but still i think its more morally correct to not get so swept up in industry - it only aids to the separate ness that everyone in our generation feels the nowhereness, and island like mentality- dad told me when i was little that every one is like an iceberg floating in a vast ocean and from the air you only see these little pieces floating so far away from each other, but beneath the surface, in our subconsciousness, we are all made up of the same water that connects us that we are surrounded by. so we aren't really all alone were all created from the same stuff. i probably sound like a televangelist but i shouldn't care what you think of me anyway. i wish i could just cuddle up with justin under heavy covers-warmth- and just feel his arm and shoulder under my neck and feel the ebb and flow of his breath on my forehead and slip away to sleep i love waking up next to him so warm - it doesn't even matter if we get married - i've thought about it sometimes. its what's now that's important and i love him and we're happy if we ever do get married in a million years it will be because that will make us happy then ,whenever then becomes now.

"""today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what i remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. back then, i was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. but now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. i don't know what it was that did it. perhaps it was that one acid trip that i took at last year's phish concert. man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. makes you feel selfcritical. i don't know how i feel now. ever since this year began, i've been a little more tired than usual. but, i've been a little stressed out, too. not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. enjoyable, too. having sex with that girl sue was a bad move, though. first of all, she's kind of nuts. i know she's lonely, too. must be tough coming all the way from california here, but at least her family's from texas. she's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. it's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world i think. i mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. all those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. personally, i think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, i'm not an old man nor do i have a family to support. i hope this girl doesn't get racked up. i'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. and, i know that if i'd gotten some loving in the last three years i wouldn't have done it. i used her and i feel rotten for it. but, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, i fear. somehow, she identifies these two things with me. don't really know why, because i never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but i never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. man, i hate complaining, but i got to say that i've had some bad luck with women these last few times. first there was lexi. i'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but i'm sure i loved her in some way. can't speak from her end of the line, though. the problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, i was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. that's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can i say? i haven't really gotten that far yet, though lord knows i've tried. i was thinking the other day about whether or not i fear women overall. well, i sure like to talk and think about them a lot. my mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. i know she loved me a lot, although i hate to admit it, and i guess that's why she was. or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. anyway, nonetheless, i've been afraid of her forever and i'm ashamed because i think it fucks up my deal with other women and i really have a hard time deciding if i love her or not. i know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do i really? of course i do on some level, but, man, i always get all tearyeyed when i even start thinking about it. that's another thing: i haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. oh well, c'est la vie. my friend elizabeth comes to mind now. i wonder how she's doing up there in ny. we have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when i learned that she liked matt for a long time. guess i always had a little something for her. that was a great time up at the doubletree last christmas, though, i will say. mr. a footing the entire bill, too. i guess townes van zandt does have it right when he said, ""we all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" last night, i learned about some of manny's holes concerning his father. he sure has been acting differently lately, though. it must be tough, but i don't know how to handle it. maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. i kind of liked that emily girl i met last night as well. i guess that statistic that says that men think about sex'women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. or, maybe i just have some complex or something. probably a combo of the two. i don't know what to think about god these days. i sure have been praying a lot to him lately, though, over this sue pregnancy thing. god, i hope that works out for me. i know it's selfish, but, man, you've got to understand. i truly am sorry, and i'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. lord, hear my prayer. amen. our society's kind of funny these days. if there is a man upstairs, i hope he's having a good time. it's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. after high school, i mean. sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman i'm sure. i wonder who's got it worse. ""sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" it just so happens i'm tired of being a man, says octavio paz. i guess we all feel like that sometimes. well, i guess my 20 minutes is up, but i do like this. maybe we'll talk again sometime. see you, man. take care and good luck.

"right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not i just submitted a blank page because i hit the tab button so i could write in paragraph form and then boom. the screen said you have submitted, thankyou. but anyways i hadn't even started. right now i have no idea what i am supposed to be writing, the assignment seems to easy. usually that means i'm doing something wrong. right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write. i feel like i'm in a sort of mellow mood, after all, there's not much excitng going on right know. i have calculus to do and i almost don't want to pick up the book because i know i won't be able to do some, andthen i may get a bad grade on the homework. that means that i will get a bad grade in the class unless i do perfect on the tests. well, i wish i knew how to type, not that this assignment would go by any faster. sensations? well i'm sitting on a chair, i can feel it supporting me. i have this habit of biting my lips, so i can feel that to. only bite the inside of your lips because then they don't look all messed up all the time. if someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me. i wonder if the box keeps going, yes it does. wait. agh. a drink of water. more sensations!! i felt the water coldly flow down my neck where i imagine it's being mixed with luch. which was a 9 inch sub from ""po boys?"" at least it was relatively healthy, but it's more expensive than wendy's. oh man i hope that somebody doesn't call because i might have to write this over again. or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than 10 minutes and not done anything, that would be bad. does that mean that i would have to go back and write this all over again. well, i can't wait to get this done because i get to relax for one damn second of the day. i've been up since 7 walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back. it makes me hunch over because if i stand up straight then i would fall over. i hope i don't have a bad back when i'm older. at least i'll be smart. wow i've already been writing for 15 minutes, probably about the wrong stuff, but hey. another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard. and i can see the keyboard. my cell phone just rang, i could hear that. well, anyways, this whole 20 minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about. i wonder what other people wrote, actually i could care less. their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine, but anyways. i really hope this actually submits. after all, it is the last minute. i'm glad paul reminded me.

"well, here i am on friday, september something. ever since i started college i've had a hard time keeping up with the date. not really a smart thing to do since i have to stay on top of things here. i need to start keeping a daily planner. i say that everyday but then i forget to do it and it's just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do. i'm pretty hungry right now. no, i take that back, i'm not that hungry. i could eat but it's not to the point where i feel like i have to eat. my friend and i are going to lunch today. i'm so glad that i've made a friend that i can hang out with and talk to all the time. it's not the same like my friends at home though. i miss melissa and amber. i really don't know why it is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking. we talk about nsync a lot more now too. typical, we find comfort in them in our time of need. i wonder if the nsync guys would think that we're crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who justin belongs to and who jc belongs to. they crack me up. heck, i crack myself up. we talk on the phone and i have melissa and amber rolling on the floor with laughter. it's so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually i'm the one doing the laughter. a lot of times i just laugh to be polite. i fake it pretty well, if i do say so myself. i wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs? well, if this is just my one continuous thought then i guess not. okay, i love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes, could somebody please turn up the air conditioning. i think the university is trying to freeze us into studying. i hope they know that they're just freezing me into complaining all the time. and another thing, is it impossible for people to not slam their doors? really, it doesn't take that much effort to quietly close the door. i should randomly slam my door. i think every hour on the hour, i'm going to slam my door. no, that's not frequent enough. i'll slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point. really though, dorm life is not bad at all. my dorm room is so cute and i really like my roommate. no waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting. i still don't like to call this place home. home is where mom and wayne are. this is where i reside. it would take a lot for me to consider this place home. i need to do my biology homework. i wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are? the funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives. i can't even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap i'm going to do with the rest of my life. i'm pretty sure that life as a professional bum is out of the question. don't think mom would be proud of me then. okay, looks like my time is running out and i should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence. okay, how do i end this. i really don't know. this was actually kind of fun. just another way for me to analyze my random, boring, and crazy thoughts. red hot chili peppers on vh1 now. got to go. and we're out in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. bye! (it says that i can finish writing, but honestly i got a date with a fine young man named biology) ",0,-0.669509 -0.0214 0.912878 -0.081647 -0.033979 1.467026 -0.387553 -0.331889 -0.188005 0.106298 -0.185966 0.178101 -0.254147 -0.370591 -0.760464 0.0 -0.04277 -0.171533 -0.134164 2.198059 0.450366 -0.742368 -0.412558 1.101227 1.450831 0.020313 0.468006 0.044571 0.802746 1.394041 0.935552 0.226036 -0.332494 -0.906028 -0.199285 -0.384339 0.092281 -0.75932 0.221812 0.387698 -0.489992 -0.48939 -0.411796 -0.063199 -0.809347 1.016038 -0.798855 0.146134 1.086461 0.057981 -0.618206 -0.17008 -1.128226 -0.245647 -0.881575 1.309423 1.779085 -0.340848 0.175138 0.122086 -0.049049 -1.309081 -0.480161 -0.350225 -0.153978 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.164981 0.306193 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.190996 -0.19129 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.386894 0.427883 -0.148965 0.247273 4.777653 3.483452 4.606221 4.61652 4.759416
" so i started my college life about two weeks ago. it has all gone pretty much as to what i had expected it to be like. i live in university towers which is an off campus dorm and i have met tons of new people. i live with four girls whom i didnt know when i first started school. some older people at the university set us up. i really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. we get to experience our new life together. we get along great and do everything together. i am also really enjoying the fact that i get to make all my decisions on my own. not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. i mean i don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work i have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. i have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. i have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. with homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. my roomate and i have had grown very close over the past two weeks. we have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. we realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. i feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. we both experienced texas recruitment together. we both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. we accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. i feel at home whenever i am at the house. each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 63 of the new pledges. i am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. i am taking 4 classes which comes out to 14 hours. i chose the classes that i wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. the work load started off fine and i think that i am going to be able to handle everything. i was a little nervous at first about the large classes because i came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 10-35 people. my classes at texas on the other hand were quite large. i didnt know if i was going to be able to concentrate during a lecture if there were on average 100-300 people in the classes. as soon as one day passed i knew it wouldnt be a problem as long as i got to class early so that i would have a decent seat and be able to listen as closly as i could. as these last two weeks have flown by i have realized differnt tecniques to make the rest of my experiences at texas even better. i have learned from my mistakes and i have gained from my experiences.

"so far this freshmen year has been a intereasting adventure if you like s&m. i came down a month early to go with my friends to go to all these fraternity parties and meet a few musicians and audio engineers i have had correspondence with since i recorded my cd. the fraternity parties weren't that great except for a kappa sigma one that was pretty wild. i pledged for two days before it hit me that this was a waste of time. not that waiting in endless lines (with endless hassles) to shell out more money to this fine universtity isn't making me age before my years. i am getting use to the regamorand of rude cafeteria & accounting people and trecking to classes in bfe. i can't say it's all been bad though i did get a free t-shirt and a lot of nefty junk people shove into your hands as you try to walk by. oh, and then there are the roads with the none existent left turns, constant construction, 30-min limit parking (when you can find it), and cops that stop you for the fun of it. i don't know if its been- oh it gives you more space well then i can continue to ramble. college is supposed to be the best years some say. i think i should of keep better stock in my highschool years. now except for parties i live like a reclouse in my apartment doing homework for a foriegn language i don't want to learn and trying to write more music while the people above me sound like there having basketball pratice up there. i'm sure it has been atleast twenty minutes by now and if you 've read this far then you're probably ready to quit reading by now. so i'll let you off till i have to write the next one.

"hi i'm ben. i've been looking forward to this assignment since i heard of it. how often do i get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. i apologize. i can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. i'm listening to emenem right now. i don't want to give the reader the impression that i'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and i can type fast to it. man i pity whoever has to read this. let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. i was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no i wasn't high). i mean think about it. i'd go into this more but i'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. i really like ut. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. i like austin. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in austin. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. i can't stand him. i brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that i'm using right now. i usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. i suppose i could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but i promised my roommates this would only take 20 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 9 minutes really flew by. i'm a japanese major. now if you were wondering "" wow i wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? "" you know. i feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am i thinking about now. i guess i'm thinking about the way i think, and i guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. i usually think in words. unless i'm inebriated then i think in pictures. i don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that i have a short attention span but i somehow pictured this differently. i thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now i've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. while i'm telling you what to do, you should vote for gore. aww here's something i can write about: politics. i hate and fear george bush. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of austin is quite the insult. his christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. i rue the day the christian right gain presidential power. i also am happy i worked ""rue"" into that last sentence. aww yeah. well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. i also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. i'm glad i didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. i will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. i promise you i'm not crazy. well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man.

i still do not understand why my father after twenty years of marriage to my mother decides out of the blue that he is not happy and to get a divorce. why he feels that he needs to be with that other slut. my mother has been a great wife to him and without her he would probably be nowhere today. he thinks that just because he will give her money that she will be okay without him. but money can't buy happiness. i just hope that my little brother is a okay he is only twelve years old and he gets sad when he thinks about his dad not being there i just do not know how i am going to be ready for my test on wednesday i have to study way too much for the next two days and i need to get an a in biology i need to do good in all of my classes to raise my gpa i just hope that my mom does good on her test also because she has been working hard to make the grade my little brother has been working hard in football to get the starting position with his little friends i wish that could just go back to being a little kid when everything was okay with my parents and i did not have to worry about anything but just being a little kid i would not need to worry about anything hopefully he will come back to his senses and come back home ,0,-1.411366 -0.288545 -1.043697 0.125028 -0.190868 -0.508291 0.009339 0.18052 -0.252481 -1.563615 0.293687 -0.590446 0.481197 3.075363 -0.439374 0.0 -0.04277 0.428569 -0.912526 -0.795527 -1.177014 -0.742368 3.711028 4.122307 3.581793 -0.113704 0.967454 -0.058895 0.575401 1.496572 0.733808 2.151654 -0.775734 1.263546 -1.017959 -0.129614 0.435822 1.333178 -0.179053 1.747168 -1.038726 1.148186 -1.426632 -1.643086 -1.429535 -1.542652 0.499121 2.430226 -1.256915 2.543969 -0.033866 -0.197499 -0.779632 1.206634 2.172698 -0.631096 -0.71738 -0.954251 -0.05265 1.030733 -0.804269 -0.026876 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.711214 -1.364578 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.4427 -0.451544 -0.408772 -2.47265 4.785414 4.384557 4.356343 5.185689 4.069294

they are playing ou as i write this and i am hoping that they loose. i keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down i really want them to loose. when they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him? i know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. this makes me extremely jealous and insecure. adrian is my first love. he is the first person i ever really cared about. i don't know if i am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. there are so many more important things that i should be worrying about right now in my life. i am in my prime. i am terrified of getting hurt. i'm scared that i am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when i really need him. i can almost see history repeating itself: in high school i stood beside adrian when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where i needed someone there for me we was too good. i still have a tremendous amount of anger towards adrian for the things he did to hurt me. this relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but i'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that i would be willing to lay down my life for. i don't know if i am being insecure about our relationship because of things adrian has done in the past or because i feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like i am not worthy of someone liking me. ,1,0.205422 -0.597338 -0.529371 -0.229464 -0.347944 0.112965 0.565223 0.959751 0.473124 -1.33263 -0.087061 0.253448 0.70332 0.272591 -0.128817 0.0 -0.04277 0.865834 0.637248 0.21193 0.729418 -0.742368 1.886089 -0.7679 -0.624052 -0.711616 1.2585 -0.491961 2.577105 1.622361 1.126407 2.918543 2.004875 5.239969 1.36984 0.476583 0.335026 -0.912936 0.320812 0.929465 0.161629 -0.405575 -1.548301 -1.09235 -0.751204 -0.982939 0.19553 0.282443 -1.363783 1.525772 0.247225 0.115244 0.266988 -0.139086 -0.356968 0.227881 -0.41631 1.729384 2.183414 -0.312655 -1.020756 2.219932 -0.480161 0.982819 0.312539 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.635817 -1.364578 0.234084 -0.23436 -0.025351 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.923193 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.495113 5.133027 4.518914 4.723868 4.903933 4.865571
"as i begin writing this i am a little annoyed because i'm doing it on my friends computer mine is broken. i wish i could just get my computer to work and be dependable. also as i'm typing i'm thinking ahead as of what to say i guess i shouldn't do that or maybe that's just the way i think. the phone just started ringing but i'm not even going to answer it. i've been laying around all night watching a movie with a girl i used to like a lot. she's a beautiful girl and part of me still likes her but oh well. things are different now and i don't really mind that. also i've recently decided that i didn't want to be in a fraternity. i always thought i would, but really it just wasn't my thing. right now i'm kind of kicking myself because i'm missing out on partying, but at the same time i hated the amount of time i spent doing stuff at the house. i felt like every one was here to party and study on the side. i wish i could do that but i can't, i need to do well in school. this weekend is dave matthews and i'm very excited. the concert is two nights and i'm going to both. dave is my favorite musician and i've been looking forward to it for a long time. also it is very hot in this room where i'm typing i wish that i could just some how make it like fifty degrees in here. i really like the cold weather and am looking forward to a break from the heat in the upcoming months. i think i like the cold because i'm hot natured, but also because i have good memories of winters. i love to reflect on the christmas with my grandparents. as i glance down at my watch i see that my time is almost up so i guess i'll try to muster something great up. i don't know i'm a blank. i do however miss my family a little. i really miss my brother. it's odd because we always used to annoy each other but now i'd really get a kick out of seeing him.

"so here goes. i am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff. it seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time i have to complete everything just keeps shrinking. i hope and pray that as time goes by i will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life. it has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work. but as my brother once told me, you must work hard in order to play hard. i'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly, and keep thinking positive about my situation. i'm hoping that i can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come. well enough about that. i'm really starting to miss my family a lot. i think that is really lame but i can't help it really. like i love austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of sunnyvale, texas that i miss incredibly. i went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends. gosh i love my friends here but its just not the same. there is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave. but i know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals. and ut is the place to do it. i love this place! the people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change. i am so excited about this weekend! one of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and i keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend! gosh you know what. i'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15"" theory! because i sure do eat a lot these days. the food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist! its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you. no here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it! its great! its amazing to me how different college life is from high school. like in high school everyone cared about everyone else's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here. no one cares about anyone else's business at all. people are just concerned with themselves. and another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules! like you can do whatever the heck you want and no one will tell you that you are wrong or that you can't do something. oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking, you can! i laugh every time i see people doing that in my classes. i would never be able to make myself do that because i'm too much of a chicken but i think its so funny! gosh. i'm really starting to get hungry again. that is so bad! no! i can't eat again! i am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm. that is really late and i'm extremely tired! i really hope that i can find a date to anchors away. that is really bugging me. i wish i knew exactly who i wanted to take and who wanted to go so that i wouldn't have to worry about it anymore! alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so i'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me. haha! this was good. its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once. i actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper. not to mention that i feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing i have to worry and stress out about. well that is all i have to say for myself at this point and time! peace!

"it is 4:59 and i have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. i can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that i am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that i will only be graded for the fact that i did it and not examined for the content of my mind. does everyone hold their mind as sacred? i can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way i guess i am somewhat obsessive'compulsive. it's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. this openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do i have to say? this 20 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who i am sometimes i think that's what life is about everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet i wish i had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. who doesn't want to be analyzed? who doesn't want to analyze? i know that i am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, ""voyeurs"". i had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. my friends considered themselves ""voyeurs"" and i had to admit that i am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions i only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. it strikes me as funny that i am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that i am talking to you to the extent that i can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? i was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. i thought again about how different i feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and i feel like i've written a lot. if i were a ta i would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as i read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and i would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. but perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are ""true to science"" yay! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. i am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet i cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? it has certainly given people (i've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. i don't discount science, i do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. it's a tough tough thing. of course 99% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous i can imagine. but as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? i have been asking a lot of questions! how defining of me! now i (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. i will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 3 minutes actually the time will be up. well love and life and craziness and all the things i thought i would end up saying are not surfacing here, although i think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? i think i remember once reading about oh shit i lost my train of thought oh yeah, i think it might have been carl jung (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. those few seconds that you pause when someone says ""mother"" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha ha! uhoh time's up. this has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words i was using. thank you very much.

"i am glad that i am finally getting to this assignment! i have had so much homework, and just can't seem to stay on top of things. ""i'll have the weekend,"" i continue to say to myself, but i know i'll just want to watch television or hang out instead. i went to the meeting of the tennis club today, and am very excited about that, even if i have to ride the bus to the courts whenever i want to play. i went running this morning, but just feel so out of shape. i know i'll never be super skinny, my body just isn't built like that! i'm looking forward to playing again. i'm even willing to brave the tournaments, or at least look cool wearing a new t-shirt showing off my participation. i'm sill hoping to meet some people who i can actually hang out with, go out with, stuff like that. i meet many people, but none of them seem to be willing to get to know the real you. they all have friends here from school, yeah, like anyone else from wyoming is crazy enough to come here. i also want to play the piano some while i am here. i don't have my books, so i'll have to recover them when i go home in october. i am excited about that, it will be so neat to ""fly home"" for the weekend! hopefully i'll make it up to cheyenne and laramie to see some people. i've been thinking a lot about holly lately, and would love to be able to connect with her through seeing den'ja and preserving her memory. too bad he is never home when i call. while i am doing this, i realize i need to do the pre-test, i just can't seem to find an hour! the weeks are already flying by, and the panic of upcoming tests is setting in. ""oh no, only a week and a half until the first psych test!"" i'm caught up in reading, re-typing notes, now all i need to do is read them over. i'm so tired right now, all that is left on the agenda for tonight is german, and reading chapter 5 of astronomy. it will be nice to actually do problems for once, instead of living my life reading and taking notes. i can't wait until i am confindent in my self-image, if that ever occurs. i just don't have the will power to work out like a crazy woman! tennis. just keep thinking. tennis. i really do love tennis, and its number one male star pete sampras. too bad he is injured, the us open just isn't the same! maybe my new tennis partners will become my new buddies! speaking of tennis, another thing to add to my list is to check on match mates. wow, twenty minutes can be a long time when the assignment is to ramble on about yourself. sophia has to go to the mall this weekend, so i'm going to go with her. rue 21 and forever 21, i need to buy myself a new outfit. it will be quite the experience catching the bus to get there though. just like making it to the tennis courts, i'm a pro at the campus look today. i hope the woman who feel outside jester is ok, that would be so scary! i need to go to bed, and tomorrow is my super long day. the si sessions are going to be a big help, but they are just such a pain to attend. an extra three hours a day is enough to make me crazy. freshman leadership organization meets tomorrow, so that will be fun. also, party on the plaza is tomorrow night, a fun function. i hope i didn't miss austin powers playing on the south mall. i didn't get very much e-mail today, that makes for a depressing day. i did, however, get my high school yearbook. i loved how i pimped that school, i miss the friendships. i miss tennis season. most college students say they don't want to go back to high school, but at this point i wouldn't mind. i'd have to say i loved not doing homework. ooh, our sing just sounded like it was about to die. i love the internet, it is so convienient typing this paper to submit via the information super highway! i am completely addicted to my computer, and i'd die without it. i type everything, e-mail everyone, it is truly my life! well, my 20 minutes are up.

"as i sit in this room, in this computer lab, i hear all the different sounds around me. the computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. i also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as i type. i've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. my eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, i would love to take a nap. this day was pretty long. i hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. i'm feeling so tired! i would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. i don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. i know when i go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but i ate way too much today and i am not in the least bit hungry. not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. i wish i was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. i hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. it would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. seeing him makes me miss him more but i guess i should enjoy our time together. i wish he went to this school or at least lived in austin then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. he seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. i don't believe him when he says that. i wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. i am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. i hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? i wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. i think i'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because i'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. i do love him though. it'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. tonight is thursday night. this is a good night because i have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. i should have done this assignment earlier but of course i always wait for the last minute. but technically this isn't the last minute because its not friday yet, and it is early evening. tonight i want to do nothing but relax! i hope i can get together with my friends since i don't see much of them anymore. i wish i lived at jester at times like this. i thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. i have this sweatshirt on but i don't feel like taking it off. how many more minutes until my time is up? i've typed quite a bit of information thus far. pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. i wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that i type fast and i can type basically every thing that i am thinking. this computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. i hear music and i'm wondering where it is coming from. i figure since tonight is the mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. they should have a honduran culture night. haha. why is the computer across from me making so much noise? wow. i sure do ask my self a lot of questions. well, i think my time is almost up. i guess i have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. i am so terrible at mental math. what happened? i have 5 minutes left i guess. how terrible i am at mental math! i am glad that i don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. my grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and i've been too lazy to go to the office hours. but i did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. i walked all that way to jester for nothing. i'm sure if i got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. why am i assuming that i will get a bad grade? maybe i won't. the ta seems pretty easy going and she knows that i am interested in keeping'getting a good grade for that class. i. am glad the movie station is back on. i'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. sleep. i want to sleep! i wish i wasn't always so tired. yes! i only have a few more minutes left. i'd say about 2 minutes left. finally! this is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in times new roman font. i didn't know i had that much stuff running through my head. actually, it doesn't surprise me. i always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and i can't think straight. i think that's why i interrupt people so much when i'm talking. because i have so much stuff in my mind that if i don't say it i'll forget it. i guess that shouldn't matter since i'll have another 10 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. but anyways. my time is up. how great!

"writing this paper on friday is extremely irritating for me. i know that i was given plenty of time beforehand, but being the procrastinator that i am i waited until the last minute. this annoys me because i usually do this on most of my assignments. i have a feeling of regret that i didn't do it beforehand. it is hard for me to concentrate seeing that after i am done writing this assignment i am going to go back home to visit some of my friends i haven't seen in awhile. this gives me a good feeling. it is almost a feeling of relaxation and anticipation all in one. tonight i am also going to go to a football game in my hometown. thinking about watching a football game gives me a rush. i get flash backs of my quarterback going through the snap count, my heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety as i am about to get the ball, the snap, and a huge burst of adrenaline as i get the ball. thinking back through each step i can feel the emotion that was accompanied each step, only at a lower level. i am also extremely tired having stayed up way to late last night. this is probably why i am finding trouble concentrating and being consistent with certain ideas. i also feel confused because i really think that this isn't what the professor wanted, but too bad.

"this blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. i wonder why i put 3 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-i probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. i wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, i'm going to scoot up. i can't believe its sat at 700 pm and i'm writing this. i'm such a nerd. actually i'm not. ,. i'm cool--but that's all relative i guess. i'm really into drinking my coffee and i'm staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and i really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it? jewel is playing in the background volume 5 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. i can totally relate. i wonder if scott is thinking about me right now--i hope he's not the t. a for this class. this is so incredibly weird. i think i like him but i'm not sure. he reminds me of scott wolf and i can't stand him is that a bad sign? i like richard's accent too. wow english accents are really cute. like in london. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like gavin rossdale but he was speaking italian so i doubt it was him. i wonder how liz is doing? and michelle? why isn't ken calling me? i hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. kind of like max. i wonder how he's doing i wonder about his dumb model sister in paris. whatever. i love jewel. i want to play piano right now even though i haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 7 :20 already and this is pretty fun. i should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks i'm a rambling idiot? i have an ache in my heart about the council. i wonder why my name isn't on the list? i swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. they are so retarded. maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think i'm full of crap and making it up. but i really think that way. maybe it's cause i was listening to jewel at the time,. i wonder when my roommates are getting home they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 700am this morning for crew tryouts. ok, i probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. i have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. i wonder if st4eve will get back to me on being the coxin. i have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did i staple scott's number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me? he writes like such a guy. my walls are so bare. and the st4reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. i wish i could write songs like jewel. i want to play the guitar well too. i miss my dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and i wonder why i returned that dress. this screen is so confusing i lose my place my toe hurts and i feel full. my wrap was gross though. i can't believe they didn't take my cds--they're so retarded. my tailbone hurts and i hope i'm not sore tomorrow steve was a bit extreme. i keep hitting the wrong keys i really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but i know i need to do my homework. i hate calculus homework. i'm dreading it. i wonder why i'm so down and pessimistic today? i'm usually not. oh--gosh, i've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. i wonder if i typed more than other people did and i wonder if a ta. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it? weird. maybe i should play my guitar.

"adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in ""having a good time"" have all been fairly easy to get used to. meeting new people has been exciting and the ""name game of trying"" to remember everyone i have met has been a challenge. this labor day weekend i saw the huge different between high school and college as i decided to take a road trip with three other friends to galveston, a popular labor day hangout. i don't know if it was the college parties that made the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. one thing is for sure those times are over and getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. this weekend has also showed me that i am a very patient person. my roommate paul has shown this to me. having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. if i am still sane at the end of the year i think that i will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with paul. i feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. o, i almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 4. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. basically i hope to work hard and play hard.

"i really don't know what to type. i wonder what this keyboard is made of. i really hate it when i type and i have to keep on pressing the backspace. the air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it's really cold. my neck hurts. what the heck is that on the ceiling. was it there before? i remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck. is that how you would spell spit-wads? there's so many words that i'm not quite sure how to spell. i remember i used to hate spelling tests in elementary. wow, i couldn't believe that i sat next to someone today in my calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class! i hadn't seen him in forever. i must say it really freaked me out. it was hot today. the walk to the business school killed me. on the one hand i love that i live in kinsolving. great food. nice people. close to the drag. plus a whole lot of my classes are near kinsolving. when did lisa leave? it must have been around 12. i wonder when she is getting back. i'm excited to go home tomorrow. even if it is just for a few hours. i left so much stuff there! i mean, i would have my mom just send it to me, but if i give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room, there's no telling how long she would search, and definitely no telling what she would find. that's not to say that there's anything significant that would get me into any trouble. but i know that there's old notes from junior high. crazy pictures from those crazy party nights. and who knows what all else. man, that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason. i definitely hate timed tests. such as the sat's. for starters i hate the fact that it's a standardized test. secondly, i hate that it's timed. and above all else i hate the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores. now i know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants. however, some people are just not good test takers. me! in school i can study, understand, and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes. but going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous. see, look at me. when i start talking about tests and intelligence scores i try to make coherent sentences; in other words i try to make myself seem intelligent. enough of that. what else am i thinking about. i can't believe that i am actually in college. it sounds so clich', but i can remember just yesterday when i was in elementary school. how my biggest concern was who i was going to play with after school. or what time recess was. it was great being a kid. that's not to say that i don't enjoy the freedom that i have now, but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility. i have my mom on my mind and i think that's what made me type that sentence. i just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what i was thinking at that moment. i would think of something and then type it. now my hands seems to just be flowing, my fingers just seem to be hitting keys. that's weird to me for some reason. well i only have a couple of minutes left. to me, 20 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts, i figured i wouldn't be able to do it. but here i am. this chair is so uncomfortable. it's so hard and so wooden. at least it's not a big, soft chair because i would never get anything done. i would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read. reading. something that is my downfall. i do love to read, but making sure that i have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story. ouch. something just bit me and i'm a little curious to know what it was. probably an ant. ,isn't that gross! we have ants in our dorm room!

"hmmm. stream of consciousness. follow my train of thought. i guess i can say i've had experience with this in that i used to, and still do sometimes, write down stuff when i just had to get something off my chest. i followed my thoughts and emotions. it helped me a lot to get through some things. i had never really done anything like that until this past summer. i guess it was because i hadn't had anything bother me so much until then. but anyhow, i am not about to tell you about my experience; that is personal. i find it strange that i never really liked to write, assignments for example. i found it so boring and pointless. but now i realize that many authors write for pleasure, for entertainment, or to simply get something off their chest. but i guess you learn as you go. so far i feel i'm doing ok in following my thoughts, which have been pretty much superficial. anyhow, i'm here completing an assignment, and complete it i shall. besides, there are no right or wrong answers. now, i'm just looking at the keyboard because my mind has gone blank. i thought this assignment would be easier for me seeing that i've had experience in writing my thought without planning ahead, but i didn't think i would have this much problems in having a subject to write. i just thought of something. it is something i had thought about during the summer, while i was going through the experience mentioned before. i feel that many people skip the thought process and just act with what they feel. i do agree that it is important to satisfy your emotions, your feelings, and your desires, but there must also be some thought put into a decision. without this thinking process, a person could get him or herself into a lot of trouble. for example, if for some reason person a decides he feels like killing someone, he could get into a lot of trouble for doing it. if he thinks about it ahead of time, he will see the dark road ahead. he will realize that he is just being crazy and that satisfying his feelings could cost a lot. and yet, i find it hard to believe that some people, some of whom i know personally, don't use this process. take for example many teenagers. they got out with friends. they get drunk and end up crashing and in the hospital, if they are lucky to be alive. had they thought about the consequences, chances are they would have realized that getting drunk was not worth it. but then, there is also an ""evaluation"" that takes place when this thinking process is used. in the case of the teenagers, they are probably aware of the consequences of getting drunk and driving. i mean, they see it everyday through various media. they probably realize that the consequences are pretty bad; yet they choose to go ahead and drink. they are willing to take the risk. they have decided that getting drunk is more important, or at least worth the risk, than their lives. it's probably that stage in their lives when they feel immortal. when they feel invincible. i was a teenager once, but never did i do the things that many others did and still do. i consider my life to precious to waste on one party. i have just made an evaluation after the thought process. i have found throughout the years that i tend to hold myself back on certain actions. i feel like doing something, i want to do it, but yet, my mind says ""stop. is it right? is it good for you? is it ethical?"" etc. , etc. i consider many things before actually making a decision. although my feelings and desires might be held back for a while, i know that at least my life remains the ""right"" track. you will notice that my college experience will be a little different from other students. twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds have gone by, so i guess that's time. hope you enjoyed!!!

"okay here i am after i've been spending tons of time trying to get a book i need. i'm not worried about it anymore. i will focus on my other homework. i need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. maybe i won't eat lunch. tonight i have a party to go to and i am excited. i need to tell my friend what time we will leave. where will i park? maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. the radio is on and i'm listening to country music. it's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. i am going home tomorrow. i can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. i will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. sleep is a priority as well. oh, and i'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. wow, i forgot about the chance that i will get a home cooked meal. i need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. i'll come home monday evening. i need to wash my car while i'm there. i hope my roommate is occupied enough while i'm gone. she can come home with me another time. i hear people in the hall all the time. it's amazing how many are up as early as i for an 8 am class. no one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. my eyes burn because i'm so tired. i took an hour nap yesterday, but i don't have time today. i can't get my ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--i'm very frustrated. very chapped! i am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things i need to do. i know though that i can get it done, just one thing at a time. plus, i am doing one of those things right now. i wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. i'm an hour away, not bad. i hear this song ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" and it reminds me of eddie murphy on the old saturday night live. he did buckwheat impersonations. i have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. i hope this doesn't sound like a letter. i am beginning every sentence with ""i"" but that's okay because i am supposed to notice how ""my"" thoughts flow. i wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. i just wish i could get my ethernet hooked up. i like america online, but it's tying up my phone line. that is also making my anxious right now. i guess the faster you type the longer the paper. i wonder what the other students doing this have to say. i wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. i hope i get some mail soon. i check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. i know people are writing'sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. that's my optimistic side. i hate the cold floor under my desk. i'm in jester, but i have carpet that i brought to go between the beds. i'm thinking of my friend in alaska that will come at christmas time. will we have time for me to show the good stuff about texas? my throat tightens to think of it. i stress easily. i feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that texas is the coolest place to be. it won't be as pretty in december though. great, i have about 5 more minutes. my hands are slipping off this tiny space. i have no room on my desk. i want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. it would be so ideal. i am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. i feel like i'll lose the urge to do my math homework if i sit here any longer. oh, i can't wait until the party. matchbox 20 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! i need to remember to take my camera. i also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. all of this by 4 pm--i believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. i wish i could go to sleep. i hate it when i can't focus because i'm so tired. i value sleep more than money it seems. if that makes any sense. i am ready to go now, i feel the pressure of having too many things to do. i will take care of my math homework first. then biology and art history. psychology is halfway done now, but i need to get the book. no one has it. that is also causing a little aggravation. i hate to not be fully prepared for everything. okay, my 20 minutes are up, i feel better having done this.

"i am feeling very confused at this point in my life. i am thinking about my future and my career. i am also very nervous about my classes and how much effort each class will require of me. i miss having the reassurance of my friends and family. people say that things get better but at this point i don't see that happening. i am glad that i came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then i would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. now that i am here i am sure that i was better off at a smaller school. but i think i will really enjoy what i learn about other people while i am here. at the present moment i am having to learn time management. i have load of work to do in each class and i feel that if i am not doing my work continuously that i will fail. on top of that, i feel that although i am spending most all my time doing work i am still not understanding everything. i guess i wonder why people want to give us so much work. now i just heard that on girl that i went to school with just died. what is going on with this world. i feel that more and more people are just dying. how are we suppose to concentrate on work when all this other stuff is going on. now i am talking to a friend and she just told me about what happened. anyway, i have lots of work to do and i have or i feel that i have no time to do my work. i wish i was back home resting instead of here having to work my hardest. anyway, i hope that this year will get better for me so that way i won't be as unhappy. so i guess i should have a positive outlook on life. wouldn't it be nice if everything went the way people wanted it too. no complications what so ever! i hope that god, family and friend will get me through all my tough times. i should me thankful for what i have because some people are not as fortunate.

" i am feeling sad but feeling so much better. yesterday was hopeless, today there is hope. i am realizing that i am so much more complete without my boyfriend than i was with him. next time i will not let someone control my thoughts and actions so completely. next time i will not let myself make excuses for someone. i have learned a lot. i feel like i want to kiss him so bad, to feel his lips on mine, to feel his skin on mine. i want him to hold me all night and tell me everything is all right. but in my heart i know it is. it is so hard to be his friend but i want to so much. he says he doesn't want to lose me. it is funny, we see each other more often now that we are just friends. and no that is not friends with benefits. there is no way i would let him take advantage of me like that. . but it would be so much fun. then it would hurt so much. it's really not hard to be with him, i love being with him. the hard part is leaving him. every time i do i feel like i may never see him again. he hugs me and says it will be ok, babe, i promise. i know he is right, it will. i just wish it was going to be like i thought it was going to be. i had such big plans for this fall. after waiting on him all summer, who could blame me? he seemed so perfect for me last may. what happened? i need to stop asking myself these questions and move on with my life, i know that. but being his friend and seeing him all the time is going to make that more difficult. i am just trying to be as sweet as possible and show that there are no hard feelings. i really am not mad at him; i just wish i could change the way he felt. alright, that is not really true. the truth is, i wish he was a different person. i wish he was the person i imagined he was and truly believed he was all summer. instead, i fell in love with a commitment-phobic guy who drinks to much and actually owns a rifle. i can't believe i could be so stupid. he looks so sweet and innocent. i am moving on though. or i will be shortly. i just need to dwell for a little longer. like i said, there is hope today. i know i am beautiful and intelligent and witty and sweet, i don't need him to tell me that. i just wish i had someone who would. i am trying so hard to be independent but i have never really had a significant other i could depend on so i guess it's not that hard. i guess i am just in love with the idea of being in love. i want to be swept off my feet. i just hope i'm not infected with that crazy disease where i can only love people who don't love me back because i want to make people love me. i really hope i don't push people away. i try so hard to be a good girlfriend but when someone doesn't call you when he says he's going to and leaves you hanging a million times, what are you supposed to do besides get upset and threaten to break up with them? i definitely put up with his shit for way too long. i know he will be a better friend than a boyfriend. it will just be so hard if i have to see him or hear about him with someone else. especially if that someone else happens to be his ex-girlfriend. she tried to get back together with him this summer when i was 3 hours away. what a bitch, i can't believe she would do that. i hope he isn't still in love with her. oh well, there is nothing i could do about that anyway. didn't i say there was hope today? well, there is: for the first time in days, i actually felt hungry. it felt so good to eat and not feel like i was going to throw up. it also felt good to not burst into tears every five minutes. yeah, there were a few times when i would have liked to, but i think i did alright today. after all it has been only a little over 24 hours since he made his decision. i am doing very well, i think. i think it is helping that he wants to be my friend. when i told him i didn't know because it would be hard, he begged me, saying, please try, i don't want to lose you. i am glad he did that because i don't want to lose him either. even if he is all wrong for me, at least he can be there as a friend for me. he says he might want a relationship with me eventually but i don't want to wait for him. i can't. it would end up making me more miserable than ever. i think i am better off just going on with my life and talking to him only as a friend. i think the more i see him the more i will realize how wrong he is for me. i need someone who will put me before his buddies and who will love me with everything he has. i need someone who is ready to make a committment to me. i need someone who will send me flowers just because he is thinking about me. i need a fairytale romance, i need to be swept off my feet, i need love, real love, crazy love. like all the songs, all the cliches, that is what i want more than anything. and i don't even know if i believe it exists. i want to, but c'mon folks, let's be realistic. somehow my parents still manage to love each other but there is not really much passion there, at least that i am aware of. maybe there is, but i doubt it. if true love is more than just a friendship, that means it involves chemistry and passion, but that stuff fades, it always fades. so what is to separate a strong, passionate friendship with true love? fucked if i know. all i know is, things are really looking up for me now. i'm going to be just fine. :) ",1,0.167805 -0.160951 0.459322 0.338092 0.861638 -0.508651 -0.925431 -0.874046 -1.26663 1.734558 -0.180634 0.224679 -1.802401 1.330761 -0.898901 0.0 -0.04277 1.859549 0.666831 -0.510229 0.566158 -0.188027 1.975085 0.892974 0.982605 -1.224253 -0.613745 -0.640177 1.677422 2.019473 3.313636 1.032505 0.260241 -0.408754 0.165375 0.687102 1.629605 -0.922452 1.053955 2.373524 0.660892 0.517194 0.422068 1.751023 0.107215 0.676389 1.644249 1.709462 0.495383 1.73793 -0.293586 -0.699769 -0.092173 1.167302 2.738249 -0.177635 -0.028464 0.1857 -0.84109 0.737648 -0.508291 0.92404 -0.480161 4.392982 0.183253 -0.280398 -0.086094 0.154794 0.489781 0.10063 0.262853 0.216916 -0.37208 -0.080652 -0.422267 -0.504109 -0.451544 -0.24783 0.02903 5.631828 4.315532 4.568194 5.143308 4.750809
"well to begin. i don't like spelling. you make me check my spelling but what i really want to do is just permanently change the way things are spelt. or make everyone think they way i do. wow wouldn't that be nice. hum to have everyone think the same as me. no not really. if everyone thought the same as me it would be one boring world. ""so andr'a how goes your thoughts on abortion?"". response: ""i don't know. why don't you ask yourself. "". well i bet that isn't how the conversation would go. cause the other person wouldn't think they thought like me they would think i think like them. so about the only conflict would come up as to who is the original ""who"". but how about it we took different situations and then gave everybody my opinion?. but that is a lot of work. and i don't feel like that. speaking of no feeling like working. i don't feel like working. hehe you don't know it but i just misspelled feel. i wrote fell instead. lets think about that. if a cow falls in a hole how would it get out. i guess you would have to build stairs huh. no not really you could just pull the damn thing out. damn cows way in the world are they even falling in holes. don't they know not to do shat like that? oh yeah like that little baby. who was it?. oh baby jessica(i think). wouldn't suck to fall in a hole? heheh. i was watching a movie the other day(big big movie buff) called ""cecil b. demented"" it was a great movie. one guy in the movie(he is from another movie called ""drive me crazy""(don't ever see that one). but in this movie he is a drug addict. not the scary kind that look like skeletons and shat but the funny kind that take every kind of drug. back to my point. at one point he is trying to run away but he is running in place. his excuse you ask. he's stuck in a kb hole. hehehe. i think its funny even if you aren't laughing. you ever think about that. when i write something on the computer it just doesn't laugh. damn computer. doesn't have a sense of humor. perhaps if i ripped all its cords out it would be laughing. ""hahahahaha"". no no not really. that is mean. hum. new topic okie. i like to look around and see how everybody has their own style. some like to wear tight clothes some wear funky stuff. if people have an ""outgoing"" style does that mean they are caught up in unimportant things such as outer beauty?. no not at all. people often like to dress up. in that fun sort of way. or they like to do stuff like that. alright i'm bored of this conversation. really i am. sam i am. i will not eat green eggs and ham. oh poor dr. seuss. he's six feet under. man i saw part of the emmys last week. they shown all the movie stars who had died. sniff. yi think a nice thing to paint is reflections. they are really pretty. i have a lot of stuff to do. ugh. the word stuff is so slang.

" i'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder. everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another. i keep asking myself whether or not i'm am going to make it in my major. my major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major. my friends say they don't know what i got myself into, but i keep telling them i'll be fine to not worry about me. when i say this i am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that i will be fine. this library is all to silent i think i just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing. while i'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not i am going to make an a on the chemistry exam on tuesday. i feel bombarded with chem and i don't know if i am going to be able to remember all three chapters. my mind keeps telling me that i will be fine that i just have to get used to it. high school was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it. that hasnt been my problem lately the only problems i have had all are about having not enough time. every time i talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, i tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy. i know older people had told me the same but i really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating. oh yeah i am getting off topic but this library is just boring me. i feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything. i feel like they all grasp the ideas that i don't. in high school i was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me. maybe that's just me overthinking. i can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library. it smells like a piece of chocolate. maybe it is a candybar of some sort. i don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me. i am not a real big fan chocolate but i do love chocolate ice cream. something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure. lately i have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend. i miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away. she is graduating a semester early from hs and is going to move to austin and attend acc for the remainder of the year. i offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents. i hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass. her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name. the man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing. he now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day. all she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things. she is one of the most ungrateful people i have ever encountered in my whole entire life. people who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but i see the real her everyday.

"that's what i thought, so i got very angry when earlier today they wouldn't sell me cigarettes just because my driver's license was expired. then, they wouldn't sell them to my friend because they said that they knew that she was going to give them to me. it is ridiculous!!! i am eighteen even if my driver's license is expired. just because in the last two months i haven't had two hours to go and get it renewed, they're going to punish me by not letting me buy my nicotine. some rules just make me so mad i could scream. why would they do such stupid things? i'm confused because i think that i'm afraid to audition for any of the plays here at ut because i'm afraid of failure, of not getting the part. my major is theatre arts and i hope to be an actress someday, and not one of those cheesy ladies on soaps. i want to be in movies and plays and be recognized and have money. i love acting and i've been doing it for so long and i never audition except for when i have to because i think maybe unconsciously, i feel less talented and afraid when they shake their heads at me.

i am at work right now but i don't start to work until about 30 more minutes i wonder if any one is going to if anyone is going to ask me what i am doing oh well there is this person that i think is real nice so i cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so i guess ill start to press enter when i cant see the words i am typing i feel like laughing i don't really know why well i do but it would be to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see i wish i could go home i just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. i still like the class though cant wait fort he day to be over. i is supposed to rain today i want it to but i don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard i cant type as quick as my mind thinks i'm not sure i like this computer either well i'm still skipping my thoughts on the next assignment i think i better write it down instead. ok the truth i did erase something from the beginning of this document. i'm at work for goodness sakes. why do i keep putting periods down i guess it is hard to write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok i've got to stop that oh well i didn't know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what i was doing i wish i had more time to write some more poems i will though i really want to perfect the one i wrote about the tanut this i going to look crazy when they print it out. i like this assignment though i never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn't have enough speed to get everything on the net on my computer i rally want to buy some more software for it but i don't know if i can afford it so this guy that i was telling you about is so fine i feel like i want to jump his bones i even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn't even sexual so i wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings i hope my ta gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy i have a boy friend thought it will be five years in november i don't believe it i love him though ok my mind has gone blank i cant think of anything i wish that when i write paper that the information i need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so i could write a complete 12 page paper in one day i guess i would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday i should have been writing my thoughts down i actually because aware became aware of what i was thinking it was kind of weird why to i keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow i bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment i wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if i did know. naked why i don't know so one to the next topic my the way i wasn't taking bout the winston cigarette ads you know i don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until i have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that i do i won't be doing it for the rest of my life though i do know that for sure actually i'm not sure i know what i want to do bye.

"last night i had another fight with my mother. maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. as far as i can see i have only brought her pain and no comfort. although she does make several good points about my unorthodox behavior, ultimately i am a grown man. if i told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time the result would be ridiculous. not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where i came from and what i have done. i've got a good job(insurance company $7. 80'hour), pay for my car, attend college, help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. my mother thinks that my constant ventures to places she has never been will bring about my demise. certainly there is no way i can deny about her role in my life. she has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but i don't see how she can try and write my schedule out for me according to her opinions. recently our dog had 7 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy i don't even want. i tell her to give it away and then she blames for being a cruel person in that we don't know what kind of person would get it. for a while now i have been looking for a female. and i don't mean just any ol' girl i can get plenty of those. but a lady who i won't get tired of after the first night in bed. there is several ladies out there who i would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way i thought. so i just go on with flirting' around. most girls i know think that i except something from them, but i'm simply trying to be friends. i guess that's the rep i got at anderson high. maybe because of the people i hang with. hopefully i've written enough, and if not here are some more of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. in college i've tried to have different study habits then high school. in high school i could do nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. here i know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. i can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of texas or i might end up with a poor man working for mcdonalds's or begging for money on the drag. a few days ago i read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. interesting idea.

"today i woke up really late and i had to run to class which made me tired. my math class is so easy i don't even know why i'm in it. well actually i do it's because i'm in this fig and that is pretty cool. it helps a lot. i don't know what exactly i'm supposed to write but i'm trying to just keep going. i know that i am happy today because my girl friend ginger is coming to town and i haven't seen her in a week. that also includes my mother. i really miss her and i know that she is lonely. i also miss my brother and sister and even my dad. i wish i could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before i left. speaking of partying i haven't done any of that since i came to austin which is supposedly this huge party city. i think the reason that i haven't partied is because i have not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who i go party with. i also miss my party pals from arlington they weren't my best friends but they were a blast to go party with. i wonder how they are doing right now. i think they are probably skipping class for no reason, again. i don't know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble. i never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and a lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school. that got us dhall, but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun. in fact all of high school was really fun except no all of it was fun. it was easy there was always a party and i had a group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better. those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there. i mean i love college and everything but it is just way different. and living by yourself isn't all its cracked up to be. i mean i have to clean my room, do my own laundry, and stuff like that. i also think that i had good morals installed in me because i feel really bad when i party in my room, which i thought i would do all of the time. but i guess that also has to do with my roommate. he is just fresh in from india and is not that accustomed to living in america yet. but he is a lot cooler than i thought he was once i sat down and talked to him. i guess if you give people a chance most of them come through, except for the real jerks. i am listening to prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to i fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that. i wish that i had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that, but i have neither the time or musical capacity to really do that.

"hello. my name is neha shah, and i'm a freshman this year. so far i love ut and i'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and i actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing i really fear is that i will slack off. i am great at doing my work, and i know that i will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, i have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, i'm not homesick at all. i'm actually doing very well here. i met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that i've come close to two of the people that i met. one of which i am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. i finally gained the confidence in myself and i gained so much to my self esteem. on a normal, day to day basis, i try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever i'm feeling down. my friends and family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone i love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when i have a problem, and i know that. he's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when i left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, i've recieved about 4 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. i'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. i am so proud of being indian, and i'm also very proud to be part of the family that i'm in. i wouldn't change that at all. i grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. i like growing up there, but i really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way i'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone i need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something i really wanted. i wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. i had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. i love it. i like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, i love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when i went to new york city a couple of years ago, all i wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, i like to live life like that. doing things i by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. i've always been independent and i'm fairly sure that's becuase i take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because i'm the older child. i like doing things on my own, so then i know if i make a mistake, i can fix it. i don't like depending on others all the time, but i love being with people. i know those are two contradicting statements but i do have those that i rely on, and i do consider connections when i need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, i love my life. i can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and i want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and i hope to succeed with great pride.

"i wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting? i am getting a little hungry. kym's fan is so loud, and it is making the room so cold. i think i should turn if off in a second. it smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry. i miss my cousin tabby so much being three hours away is too far. i wonder what my brother is doing right now. he probably has football practice. i hope we win the football game this weekend. that reminds me, last weekend was so crazy i don't think i am ever going to drive someone else's car again. gee that was an adventure though. i think i should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high. why does my phone light keep turning off and on? i really need to get a new one already. i hope my friend likes the birthday present i bought him. everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday! that new cd that i bought is great i actually feel like listening to it right now. oh great i have calculus homework. that stuff is so confusing. it was just yesterday when i was talking to joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at tech. he said, i wonder what i got myself into. "" and i began wondering that myself. okay what was that cow noise that i just heard from my sisters computer? that thing is always making the weirdest sounds. my sister is so smart; i wish things came to me as easy as they come to her. but what do i know i'm just the middle child. my brother and sister are always saying i have ""middle child syndrome,"" but what is that anyway. i wonder if my dad is out of work already. he always has a busy work load. man i never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family. i mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college. wow my dad is really smart too. and what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways. i wish tabby would come and visit us. i think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home. i am really attached to her. i mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now i barely even get to see her on the weekends, and with college, it makes it even harder to keep in touch. i wonder how danielle is doing at duke. i bet she is having a ball. that is her dream college and i can't wait to hear the stories at christmas. i wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now. mmm i can almost smell it all the way over here. i am still hungry maybe i should go downstairs to get something to eat.

"um i have never done this before. i guess i will think about my day today. i went shopping with friend. we went to a little store called oat willies it is kind of a ""subculture"" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin robbins to say hi. i don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable looking t-shirts. we both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the rack that didn't have a shirt on it so i guess one of his shirts was missing and i feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. oh well no big deal for me i guess. so i bought one t-shirt for three dollars and we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another little store that sells interesting odds and ends. myfriend ended up buying a bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap. then we went back to her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room. ok i think it has been about 20 minutes i hope whoever has to read th ",0,-0.82881 0.374673 -1.245359 1.067183 0.191332 0.098917 0.586128 -1.134581 -1.00195 -1.427296 -0.150774 -0.590446 2.00917 -0.703578 -0.280294 0.0 -0.04277 -0.238603 -2.295861 5.215062 -1.017938 -0.211516 1.261104 -0.677015 0.606811 0.00422 0.632314 0.101591 0.339386 0.320016 -0.295119 -0.644553 0.163686 -0.906028 -0.37042 0.610982 -1.128555 -0.821808 -0.805714 -1.093916 -1.038726 0.08711 -0.383777 -0.579519 0.042098 -0.328358 -0.394359 1.818803 0.151277 2.55903 -0.194112 -0.324833 4.000695 -1.719445 -0.243111 0.869474 1.580632 -0.954251 -0.789102 -0.604939 1.549837 -0.218867 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 2.696714 -0.086094 -0.131077 -0.86901 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 1.136316 1.174599 -1.267186 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.861311 4.628342 3.469321 4.852986 3.99458 5.197117
"i have way too much to do this week i am never going to get all of it done it's amazing that i have this 20 min to do this one assignment it is a good thing that the deadline was postponed today in class. ryan who lives in my dorm is in my class, that is cool, now i have someone to sit with. i need to study, i need to sleep, i fell asleep in the laundry room today. that's poor. at least my laundry's done. tonight i have to be in my room at 10 because my sailor sis is going to come do something to me or something. i am glad i'm here instead of home. home sucks. it is fun here and believe it or not less stressful maybe not less stressful but definietley less depressing. i'm hungry but i have ot wait until 6:15. i also have to go take reality bites back to that girl that suzanne knows who lives on my floor. i wish kim didn't have another one of those damn mixers so she could study with me tonight, i have a mixer tomorrow when she will want to study. i better clean my room i bet my roomate thinks i am a pig. oh well get used to it. man, i've only been writing a little while. psy is a good class though. no i'm not sucking up. i like it it's interesting and lightly entertaining. bad time of day though-during when i want ot take a nap. wed. is a long day, when is the weekend coming again? oh how i've missed the weekend. my stomach hurts, not from hunger but from ab machines. i just noticed that when i sneezed just now. i need to keep the discipline up with those ab machines though there is nooo way that i'm gaining the freshmen fifteen. i've actually lost five lbs. according to the scale back in dallas. maybe that is because i don't eat as much because the food sucks. i'm actually eating more down here because i'm not depressed anymore. in dallas, after my dad's death i couldn't eat. we sort of talked about that today in class--stress can shut down the stomach because we can live off of glucose in our livers--and i am sure that is what happened to me this summer. so maybe i should perceive my hunger as a lack of stress. perhaps that is the optimistic point of view--perhaps that is the lazy ignorant point of view. whatever my arms hurt, i'm tired of typing. i kind of like this form of writing you know where i can just say anything. is this like therapy or something? i always thought this was the kind of stuff therapists make their patients do. the next assignment is probably to draw a picture or something. something that expresses my ""feelings"". enough sarcasm. i feel like i have to burp maybe i drank to much coke. at least i won't go through withdrawal. i wish ryan wouldn't go play basketball before we eat--i'm hungry. maybe i'm just bored. lots of people say that overeaters just eat when they are bored because they cannot think of anything else to do. jeopardy is on. i got a free t shirt last night at gregory becuase they were filming college jepardy or someting. it looked like a few geeks in front of a camera just standing there with loud music. i never actually figured out what is going on . hey that is cool ryan just called and wants to eat. it is a shame i have to keep writing this for 10 more minutes. no wait five more. yes. i kind of like this its cool. i got nop email today. that pisses me off. i love email. the only thing in the real mail today was some anonymous letter about a credit card or some kind of bs like that. i already have a credit card. phone is ringing again. food its almost time for food. i wonder why ryan didn't play basketball. maybe he did. nah he wouldn't do that for 15 min. it probably sounds like i care a lot about ryan but i don't that is my friend's man. kim's man. he is crazy about her. it is all good though he is a nice guy and they go together weell. college rules. i think the water here in austin infected my bellybutton ring though. it's been oozing ever since i got here. i haven't changed the way i'm taking care of it but i don't know. hey i only have a little time left. because i started at 5:10 and now the clock ahs just turned to 5:30 this is me signing out.

" it is a rainy grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer has broken. i tell you what there is always something. more money more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so strange and makes me feel like i'm walking on a tight rope. i hate the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes the money chase. i will be getting back to work very soon. its been a strange summer hit over and over. it feels so good to see scott out of his brace!man he took that whole thing well. i think we both took it very well. its hard to see someone you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! i would have been a emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 3 months pretty well. free again,yes! my house always seems to become a mess, i just cleaned a day ago. it's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. i never seem to keep up with a journal i only write in them when i'm sad or depressed. what a shame i could learn so much about myself . my grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 2 pages a day. speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 3 letters from her and still have not written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! less talking more doing. that is so like me, i'm working on it but i love to talk about the things i need ' want to do instead of just going for it. like working-out its silly . ok i am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out.

"well i guess i can start with my dream last night since that is what i've been thinking about all day. it was so crazy. i had a dream that i was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. i open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in. well she walks i and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear. i don't know what she was saying but at that point i wake up in my dream as i'm struggling to move my body. i couldn't move until i realized i was out of my dream, which was maybe 3 seconds later. how creepy is that. when i woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then i completely forgot it. i don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me. i've felt ghosts before but i never felt a bad sense coming from them. weird. i always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean. i mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? i am a little worried about that but i haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone. that i can think of. oh well. anyways i have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if i want to enjoy the weekend like i should. hopefully i will be studying on the beach saturday night. not that the south padre beach ids that beautiful. after going to cancun for a week though i guess its hard to actually top that beach. that was the best time i believe in my life so far. it is good to know that i will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip. saving the money was super hard but i feel like if i really want to do something i am capable of making that happen. i hope this weekend is as good as last weekend. i am going back to san antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit. i really love the night life over here though. maybe because everything is so new over here and i really love change period. i am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter. i came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city. now i know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale. i really miss my best friend a lot though. her and i hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter. she was all i needed and i was the same for her. now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children. its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time. her relationship with that boy is so lame. thank god i have no time for stuff like that right now. i cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time. hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her. man. this is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer. everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much i am typing. they keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me. hahahahahahaha! lets see well i've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find. but unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal. this life sciences library is really nice. i think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here. there are always open computers in here as well. well my time is almost up. my experience in the psy class is very important to me considering i want to be a psychiatrist one day.

"well i am sitting here in my room and it's about 2:30 pm. my roommate is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. last week my boyfriend hooked up the ethernet on my computer. after trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. it seemed to be working, well all of the programs were working but when i went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. it said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key to terminate a program that wasn't working, well i pressed a key and the screen was frozen. what's wrong!!!! i restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. today i turned the computer on and it did the same thing. i called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour i finally go help, well i guess you can call it help. he couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for friday with someone who will help me. hopefully i can get this thing figured out. i just bought this computer a few months ago and it was very expensive. well enough about computers. i am a little tired. i had an 8 o'clock class, after the class though i came back to the room and took a nap until 12:30. i think that made me even more tired. well i need to start reading my english. i have a book i have to finish by thursday. i am half-way through, but there's still 120 pages to go. i hate reading! i read slow and it takes forever. that's not very good for an english major. i should enjoy to read, especially because i will be doing a lot of it in the future. i am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. this is a big change, i am very close to my family and it was hard to leave them. i am 2 1'2 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. i went home this weekend. i was glad to be home. i'm not sure if i like this place yet or not. i think it will take a little time. at least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. that's a positive thing. the bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. babies so they're everywhere under the sink. it is really gross. i never saw roaches before so i freaked out. the weird thing is that we don't have any open food, i guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also dark under there. we put a request in to have someone come and spray. they haven't yet. i hope they come soon! well my time is almost up. this was really weird just writing off of the top of my head. actually it's kind of peaceful because i enjoy typing. well i have my psychology class next, at 3:30 pm. i need to get ready for class. i need to check if they got the books in yet. last friday they didn't have the book in. well my time is up so i will submit now. until the next assignment. see you later!!!!

"as i sit here, i wonder what i got myself into. i came from a school of 300 people. i graduated with a senior class of 76. the university is such a huge place, i wonder if i'm going to fit in, or should i say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. it's not that i don't like my classes that i have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but i wonder what the future holds. my birthday is today, and i am finally 18. it seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. but now that i finally made it, it's no different. my mom called this morning to wish me a happy birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. her little baby girl is now 18. she asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. my grandparents also called this morning. they live across the street from my old house, and i was continuously over there visiting them. she told me that she still thinks that i'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. she says it's like i'm gone for the weekend, but i'll return soon. and my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. every time i look at him, i see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. raising 8 kids is no easy job. the day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. i was going to read for the mass. i went up to the podium and i looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. i was so proud to be a part of that. i was thankful that god allowed me to be there and have that feeling. and now when i talk to him on the phone, i get that feeling all over again. i miss him dearly. sometimes i think more than i miss my mom or my brother. now, my step dad, i don't miss him at all. sometimes i look back, and i don't know how i put up with him so long. he is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. he married my mom when i was 6 years old. i didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. he was just a total control freak. nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. from getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and i had gotten into a name calling fight. he's a dick, that's all there is to it. i never brought friends over to spend the night; i never wanted any guys to come over to see me. my escape place was at my grandparent's house. i would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. all he would tell me was that i could come up there and live with him any time i wanted to. on weekends i was hardly home, i was usually spending the night at holly's house, she is my best friend. now that i'm at college, i don't have to put up with him anymore. i don't plan on coming home anytime soon. my mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. talking about what comes to mind is difficult. i feel that i have burdened you with all of my family problems. don't feel sorry for me, i don't. life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes.

"i think that i am just supposed to write whatever flows from my mind for this one, so here i go. i really like the theory that writing about a problem helps you sort it out. it is interesting to me that putting that problem onto paper helps symbolically remove it from the mind. theories like that always seem to capture my imagination, i am a huge fan of symbolism. i miss my girlfriend a lot. i think about her multiple times each day, she just pops into my head all the time. i wish i could have called her today, but i just didn't have time. i just realized that i called her my girlfriend. i guess we are broken up now, but more because life drew us apart than any conscious decision. i am dying for some reason to call her and tell her that i love her. i haven't said that in a long time, i think it will make her incredibly happy to hear it. i hope she hasn't given up on us, although that is extremely unlikely. i have not been able to talk with her much lately because she has been grounded, but when we spoke the other day she still sounded like she cares. we've been through so much, i think she always will care about me. it seems almost corny to say ""we've been through so much"" because everyone says that about their sign. other. but with christal and i it's not like we've just been through a time where we fought with our parents or ended up almost splitting up, we have walked as close to hell as i care to come. there are still some things i hate remembering and i block from my mind. every now and then i will remember something which seemed to have vanished from my memory and i am amazed i didn't remember such intense emotion before i was reminded. i suppose it is repression, it is very odd. i don't like to think about a lot of the things we went through, it's just an emotional roller coaster i don't want to ride again. i still imagine myself with christal automatically when i think of the rest of my life and who i will be with. i cannot wait until semester when we can spend more time together. i just got a flash of memory of what it is like to be a couple who sees each other and spends together a lot. i miss her being an active everyday part of my life. she is still an everyday part of my life, but only in my thoughts. not in physical reality. i will definitely call her tomorrow, after my dreaded chemistry test. i am sure i could be studying so much better right now if i had talked with her today. i am scared that when she finds out about shea it will hurt her incredibly, the odd thing is i would do it again. but it remains to be seen if i would do it again after we talk. i feel so out of touch with her. she changed so much in the wake of everything that happened i feel like i need to get to know my best friend again. i am sure that her core personality is still the same though, i just feel weird because we have both changed and grown so much apart from one another, i am scared that we grew into two people who aren't supposed to be together.

"i cannot believe that i am actually writing and doing my assignment on a saturday. i am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying to talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and i got nowhere with my friend. i feel so bad for my friend, jimmy. he is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. i feel like i should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. i guess that i should talk about myself and not about other people, but i am just so worried about him. i have been so extremely busy today. i woke up at 7 this morning. and i had to go to a basic meeting, which i am very involved in. i just happened to be 2 minutes late, and now i have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next friday. i guess i don't mind if i do it to learn not to be late anymore. then i had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. i didn't want to go, but i felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. i am glad that i went because they are my family and they helped to support me when i needed them most. actually, my friend jimmy, which i just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when i asked him to help me move b'c he had a truck. i asked way in advance, and i called him the night before, and i even told him that he could back out and i wouldn't even mind. he actually said to my face i don't want to do it when i had driven all the way from houston to austin. i couldn't believe that he had said that! i was so mad! i mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. i got prideful, and i said that i would take care of it myself. then i realized my pridefulness, and i prayed to god to break me down. he definitely showed me how i need to be more patient these days. i then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. our mutual friend had before, but jimmy somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. i don't know. i then thought about and then prayed some more, and then i realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. i went to california on vacation, and i had bought him a key chain b'c i knew how stressed he was. i put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. the fact was that if i wasn't living by myself, then i could have gotten more help. and if he said that he was too busy, i would have understood, but he said that he could. everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. but he is so depressed and distraught and etc. i wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. i know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. i just don't understand why he is acting this way. i also have a feeling that he likes this girl who was an old roommate. everyone knows. for some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. i hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. she doesn't happen to know, and i don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. i just hope that everyone gets better.

"right now i am feeling very annoyed. i have to do my first lab write up and i am so confused. i wish i could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend i wouldn't have to worry about it. i am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. even though i am a junior i have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause i just transfered here. i don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. i can't wait to go home. i got my parents and my brother a ut gift form the co op i can't believe that jennifer is getting married this weekend. i think the wedding will be a lot of fun. i love the dress that i get to wear since i am a bridesmaid. i really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. i am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. they haven't always gotten along really well. in fact when i first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 5 other gulklirls. she is just that type of girl though to go for the ""jerk"" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the air force and then found out that he was going to alaska i think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. i n all the time that i have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that i used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things i heard about him. well i wish the best for the two of them. i hope i don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. i am still so nervous about this semester since i am in a new school. i think that i will be okay though because i know how to magage my time and use it wisely. it's dunny because there is always something to do. tonight i made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 2 of his roomates. that makes me feel good when i can do other things for people like that. we had spagetti salad french bread and i baked some cookies. i am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase i now that i am doing all i can do to be the best. not because i made dinner. but because i have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands i had to run. it is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 20 min. i feel bad because i din't work out today. i have been doing really well though by going at least 3-4 times a week and running 2-3 miles a day and then doing weights. for some reason though i feel really fat. when i think about what i ate at dinner i want to gag. oh my gosh i just thought about my gov class and how boring it is. it was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. that;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how i felt today. the cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and i think they will help out a lot. he is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. i don't think i have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. i was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. at least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. he also told us thata student told him that he talked like norm mcdoland. very monotone. that was funny. the more and more i think about it it is true. geez i can't believe i still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my ta has still not emailed me beck. at least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. that's really cool of her ",0,1.014187 -0.084268 0.162949 -0.034312 -0.213785 -1.382619 -1.025207 -0.710288 -1.133842 0.47739 -0.131849 -0.590446 -0.775383 0.260135 -1.01416 0.0 -0.04277 0.690468 -0.278522 0.214455 -0.236111 -0.546126 1.810476 -0.98024 -0.169034 0.451582 -0.749084 0.628675 -0.267173 -0.585346 -0.802602 -0.268135 0.267142 0.854372 -0.299824 -0.791349 -0.861668 1.461374 0.26476 -1.364376 -0.55738 -1.308553 0.628123 -0.077643 -1.157523 -0.195973 1.232559 0.62441 -0.179942 1.259681 -0.281516 0.079092 1.534919 0.089174 -0.443392 -1.228489 -1.895598 -0.954251 -0.065138 0.508522 0.640222 1.463578 -0.480161 -0.398731 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.236296 -1.181379 -0.073676 0.469714 -0.607823 -0.37208 0.026034 0.168053 -0.695237 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.088321 5.094142 4.253125 4.881783 5.046766 4.524325
"okay, i'm not so sure where to begin. only that i feel betrayed. betrayed by a friend that i valued. i don't understand how it happened, but i know that things will never be the same again. i sort of thought that college might bring us closer together, but i have discovered that no matter where we are, he is a million miles away. i used to think i could get through to him, but i guess i was wrong. my friends tell me he is a part of the past, and that i should look to the future, but right now i think he just breaks my heart. perhaps i'm thinking a little to much about this. i just need to get over it. until i do, i won't be able to connect with others because i'm not reachable right now. my friends all warned me this would happen, but, as usual, i wouldn't listen. i just can't help it, i want to do things my own way. do i understand myself? no. sometimes i think that i am a total psycho and i'm surprised i haven't scared people off already. i've met some nice people, but i'm just not open for new friends right now, which is such a bad idea at this point in my life. well, it's not that i'm not open to making new friends, it's that i have to let go of the past before i can pursue anything else. the trouble is that i know he is not thinking about this as much as i am. perhaps that is what hurts me the most. just knowing that our friendship meant more to me than to him. i talk to his friend, and his friend says to give it time. i'm trying to, i swear. i'm entirely too emotional about these things, i guess. i miss my best friends. i need someone to talk to. i'm not sure about this whole sorority thing, but maybe i'll find my friends there. who knows? thank god all those girls don't fit the sorority stereotype. that would be hell. but some of them are actually very cool. that makes me feel better because when i first met them all, i was scared shitless. i was so afraid, i almost cried. sometimes i think about what i'm getting myself into, and i get scared again, but not like that. i've never been scared like that. this such a scary place for me right now. maybe if i felt secure with my friends. i just think that this one guy will never really talk to me again, and it bothers me a lot. i just need to find something else to occupy my time. i really think he thinks i'm a psycho. i've got to stop thinking about this. remember what ashley said: don't try to force things, if it's meant to be, it will happen. i'm trying to keep that in mind, ash. i guess everything is up to god at this point. it's all a matter of trust. at times i'm just not willing to let someone else handle it. i've just got to let go. of everything. this guy is not the only thing i've been worrying about. i worry about my best friends. all of us at different schools. i think about what they're doing and if they're drunk right now or scared. sometimes i worry about myself. i kind of have a low self esteem. this sounds strange, but i think i like it. not liking myself. i think, in a way, it keeps you from getting arrogant. but on the other hand, maybe that, too, is a different kind of arrogance. thinking about yourself all the time, whether it be good or bad. why can't i reach you? where are you? i've got to stop thinking about things. the trouble with me, is that i don't obsess over many things, but the ones i do, it's often and it totally eats away at my life. it can kill me pieces at a time. i've lost my appetite and sometimes my desire to go out. but when i'm sitting there, holed up in my room feeling sorry for myself, i know that the rest of the world is moving on without me. especially here. at college. where no one cares. oh, matchbox 20 is on the radio. that song really ""push"" really hits me. some songs make me cry if they fit a particularly depressing aspect of my life well enough. i want to connect with other people the way that song connects with me. i just need to keep an open mind and get out there and do it. carey told me once that i need to get off my butt and do things because i'm not always going to get an invitation. this reminds me of tim off in colorado. i'm so glad patch called to see if i could come home for tim's birthday. i guess the relief lies in the security that comes from anything associated with pre-college. but i wouldn't go back if i could. i was the one of my friends saying how excited i was to leave. and i was. i'm glad i'm here, but now that i'm here, i don't know what to do. i really like this stream of consciousness stuff, and this is not because i'm trying to kiss butt or anything, it's just that i write a lot of stuff like this to let off steam. it's my own form of closure for the problems in my life. i'm thinking about going into journalism, but who knows? it was the fbi last week. i think that if you don't have anyone to talk to, you have to at least write things down. i'm starting to be friends with brian. i hope we get to be good friends. the trouble with college is that people all know that everyone needs friends, but you can't be best friends with everyone. the friend that you find that you really relate to is rare. i'm still searching. i feel like i'm holden caulfield in catcher. this kills me.

" what to write about? i don't really know. should i talk about my fears of not successeding in life. of my fears of never finding the true some one. or maybe about the sadness i feel when i think about my past four years in highschool. the friendships i made and my heart that got broken more than once. or should i talk about my family. one of my little brothers that we have a connection that is so strong i miss him very much. or maybe i should talk about the hopes of a good year. or maybe i should just concentrate on my work here and forget about the emotional stuff, maybe that will help. i came here for a reason, to kae something out of myself and make alot of money because of it. i also came to prvoe and show off to people that i am some body. i don;'t really know what to say. my head keeps going back to the first person i let in my heart that ended up breaking it. why i don't know i got over him but when you hear that he has a new girlfriend it just hurts. but then i think i must lose weight so when i go back i can make him regret it. but what do i care he is not even thinking about the future. i want to have a good job with alot of money, with a loving and faithful husband, and two great sons. i guess i want boys becasue i really never got along with any girls. me and my sister really don't have that close of bond becasue she betrade my trust and i don't really know if we can ever have the same bond. however, i i do have a great connection with my cousin who is a sophmore in highschool she knows everything about, just like my mom. my mom knows everything about me too. people think that it is weird that i tell her everything, but i don't. i can't tell my father everything because he has this vision of me that i never ever want to disappoint him. he sees me as this smart girl who can do anything. i don't see it. i believe that i can make anything out of myself, but i don't know if i can actually do it. is it going to be to hard? i really can't tell. my dad says he will love me even if i don't make it but he says it is nonsense to think that i won't i have to prove this to myself and family and my so called friends that i left behind. none of them have really kept that much in touch only like 2 or three. am i being selfish to think that my friends can't even email me. but i am glad i left. most of my friend were under class men in highschool becuase the senior friends that i had were never really my friends i just hanged out with them once in a while and when ever i did i felt like such an outcast. i sometimes feel like that once in a while. but i guess everyone feels out of place once in their life. i think i just have to let go of my past and move on. i have to start my life here make new friends. i haven't even made one yet. i have to break out of my quiet shell and just take the risk and try to meet people. this is my time to live on my own on my rules, i justgot to wake up and do it. i have to focus on all my goals and then just do it and after i do this i should look at the end of the tunnel and see my future the things i am destined to do. hopefully they will be great and my life will have happiness and success. now if my roomate will stop talking to me i could write more. mut time is ending and i must leave now.

"right now i have a flood of emotions coming down on me. maybe i'm just to sensitive. i feel that i close myself up when i'm around my friends. why i do, i do not know. there are some friends of mine that i can just relax and worry about what they think of me. my other friends, i just do not know. it's not just that, but when i am around a group of certain people, i can not open myself to them. the reason why, is that in the past, when i have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. i am very sensitive to things of that matter. i do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when i do not talk to them. i act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. things have changed since junior high and high school, but still i have to watch my back. who knows what they say or think about me. i need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. i think i am a nice person and i am openminded about certain things. i feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then i will be there to listen. whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. i still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. the reason why is that i do not think it is anybody's business. well, i do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. we are not perfect. humans have their little flaws here and there. i will admit to my flaws. there are some that i am embarrassed to admit which means i need to work on them. speaking about working, i need to work out. i worked out only once this week, and i need to work out more. over the summer, i worked out almost everyday. well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. it was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. even so, i still got my three to six times a week that i wanted to get. my clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. still, i have some more work to go. it's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. i have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and i have not been as sick as i was in the past. exercise and a good diet works. it can work miracles, and myself and thousands of people out there are living proofs. i can not afford to get sick right now, especially since school has started. if i was to become sick right now, i would be behind in all of my classes and that would not be fun. that would be bad. let's hope that i do not go down that road.

"i have a stuffy head and runny nose, and i have to carry cleanex around with me and it;s kind of embarassingf to vlow your nose in class and its feels gross and clogged. i look for nice looking peoople to sit next to in class and i feel like eceryione feels the same way about being here, like its all brand new and and no one is totally comftorable and we're all looking for a place to be comftorable. there are a bunch of girls around her ea and its funny how little contact with guys i've had in the past couple of weeks. i miss the guys in knew and was friends with in highschool and danny but i don't really miss him, but id like to see him again and talk to him. the guys here are pretty much attractive but i guess that since i'm in a new world i walk around t\afraid to talk to anyone really except for nice looking girls. i've met people, but i am totally stressed out and i'm going a bunch of different directions, and i can't focus on anybody and i can't calm myself down. veronica is comingf up today or tomorrow for a visit and i wonder how it will be especially since i've been so stressed out. i can't believe i slept for over nine hours and i don't feel completely rested. it totally understand how people pay for caffeine pills here, because this is only the third day of class. excercise will help relieve my stress i think, so i'm going to kickboxing in a little while. the only thing about that is i don't even know where the damn building is, and i have to run past this strange campus past a million strange people to take a brand new class i've never been to, and i;ll probably feel guilty because i haven't even started to stud7y yet. i know ill be ok but right now i'm making it very hard for myself to have much fun. i wonder what i'll we'll do tonight? i really want a zeta to call me and ask me to go out. even though its c razy i would have loved to be dragged out of bed and taken out to eat at six in the morning, but no one every came for me, and as far as i know no one ever called for me either. its a good thing because i needed to work out and sleep like i did and not drink. its even a wednesday and they took us out to party hardy, i don't know how these fgirls can run, because they even look fgood and have boyfriends and make food grades and go out and study and sleep. i guess its all time management and i'l;ll e\definately be forced to learn it, at least i have tom ake mysels learnit ior ill go crazy. i want to go call a zeta and hjand out with her because we will be friends one day and probably be partyingh together four years from now, hopefully. i think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. i don't know how much i would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people i had met from being a part of it. it think it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully i;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career. i have to miss the first ut football game!!i wish the zetas had a section, but maybe i can go to the tailgate party anyway if i find someone to go with, and veronica will bve here. i hope when she leaves i don't geet homesilck like i did nwhen momm and the fgirls came up. i can't believe i've really only talied to daddy once since i left san antonio. he sent me a nice letter and a nicer jchekc but too bad that a hundred dollars won;t go to o fast. being at ut in austin i dfeel like i'm in a totally different world, and i ,\can really see whant they meant about not having the time or interest to go visit other campuses. i just htought about how much fun it will be to go to aand m tosee the cross country team run, but it feels like it would take monumental organization and effort to bget up there, especially not having a car. onely four more minutesleft to type. imi liking this assignment because it reminds me of the creative writing class wiht mrs cummings nadnd how i enjoued myself in there and the free writings we would have which got easier and easier to do as the time went on, and i culd see myself more and more on the paper,and the way my thoughts went. i really like journaling but its uncomfroable to werite and i walways stop to do it late at night when i'm tired and if i do it in the morning it is eems like i get latzy and don't want to get out of bed aftereards, and i have to re read it and see all the obsesive stuff about brett wihich i am forgetting forutunately and unfortunatley. the way it isi i'm glad i don't have a boyfriend, bnot because i can run around a nd get play or do stuff with guys, but v\beecause it hink it would hadd another huge element of stresssand i really don't need that right now. i thought vivian is so gorgeous and her bf is not that cute. andni told bvern to say hi to jason for me, hut to just because i liked him and thought he was a nice guy but not because i was interested or flirting at all, or had been thin,king babout him. now the says she told him he shoul come to austin with reza, and that would be fun, but i'm thinking kind of weird too, and i don't reallywant to party with reza or old high school friends if i'm there only because of veronica and jason who lives in san antonio. i know i'll have a fun weekend because thats the only option up here, but i hope i get lots of sleep too. all done ",0,-0.463959 -1.059607 1.513395 -0.913442 -0.434778 -0.132765 -1.128545 -0.349149 -0.912794 1.904957 0.102155 -0.212914 -0.997939 -0.390496 -0.102797 0.0 -0.04277 -0.835728 -0.781931 -0.109599 -0.854512 0.323854 -0.439049 -0.379993 -0.315027 0.45804 0.165062 -0.101055 0.23003 0.751308 -0.291693 -0.246365 -0.466197 0.289546 -0.855386 -0.461465 -0.021909 1.379537 0.059429 0.294184 -0.384915 -0.699494 -0.095245 0.409773 0.417834 -0.018326 0.310719 -0.046438 0.159655 -0.313443 0.53441 -0.614728 0.184792 -0.593196 0.7388 0.61504 -0.573741 -0.58882 1.923536 -0.178842 1.189192 -1.079955 -0.480161 -0.274592 -0.312792 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.314153 0.211398 -0.073676 2.156496 -0.449193 -0.15667 -0.337085 -0.422267 0.116377 -0.451544 0.210343 -0.761086 4.812291 3.820221 4.716353 4.916417 4.731578
"i'm so glad lizz, my roommate, just left to see brad, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. i think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. i remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. i don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when i'm not using it. someone is very loud in the hall. they sound like they are having fun. wish i could join them. is ben thinking about me right now? i wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. i wish i was a better typist. there is so much chemistry i need to be doing. is there a party in the next room? cohen just walked in. is he up to something? this room is kind of hot and i could really drink something cold right now. i just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language i don't know. french wouldn't be bad to learn, though. wish i was at disney world right now. i just saw mickey and minnie on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. well mom and dad were fun, but brandon was a royal pain in the butt. i even have chip and dale wallpaper on my pc. gosh, am i a fanatic or what. i think i just know a good thing when i see one. speaking of good things, i wish i was good at chemistry so i wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. i don't think i'm doing this assignment right because i'm now to the point where i'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. my hair is in my face and i wish it was alot longer than it is so i could pull it back. jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. this comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and i always hit it when typing. who keeps slamming those doors. doesn't anyone have homework besides me. i put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. this coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, iggy is so cute nose itches. it always does. does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. if it's true i hope it's ben. i wonder where he is now. is he going to call me soon. when i get through with this i need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. i miss tara. she's the only friend i can really tell things to. if she came up to ut i would never get any of my homework done. but then again she would spend alot of time with my brother. he treats her so bad. i don't know why she puts up with it. i always wondered why people couldn't answer when i asked them what they were thinking. this assignment proves there is always something on your mind. i just hit the home key and it took me to the beginning of this writing and i wasn't smart enough to figure out to hit the end key until i scrolled all the way through what i just wrote. if i could type faster this assignment would flow a lot more smoothly and i wouldn't lose any of my thoughts while typing previous ones. i wonder how long it's been. the way i'm sitting here is hurting my back. i can't believe i wrecked my car and got whiplash. it's been two months and i'm still doped up. i can't even carry a bookbag without it hurting. it sounds like there is a guy talking outside my window but that is not possible because i'm on the tenth floor. it's been almost twenty minutes but this is kind of fun. i should do this more often. it got my mind off of chem for a while and relieved some of my stress. i'm such a basket case anyway, i worry way too much about stuff that i end up doing just fine on. the phone is ringing in the other room. i wonder when ben is going to call me. if i didn't worry about him so much and worried about chem a little more i probably wouldn't hate it so much. i can't wait to go to the frat party this weekend. there are so many guys there that want to go out with me. i wonder if that's true or if ben just said that to flatter me or to make himself believe that he has a beautiful girlfriend. oh i'm so bad, i've only known him for a little while and i'm already second guessing him. he is actually the best guy i've had in a while. he is so smart. how sexy. that guy is still talking outside of my window. i guess i shouldn't be correcting my mistakes when typing but even my friends say i'm a bit of a perfectionist.

"my toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. at least i've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable! i love them. i could live in them. my t-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. i'm kind of wondering how i'm going to do this for 20 minutes straight. my thoughts kind of wander, but i'm not sure how i can record them for that long. i have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. i think i'm just hungry. the rest of me is very relaxed because of the day i just spent out at hamilton pool, swimming and hiking. i loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. the hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. i wish my desk went back farther because i feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. i would like a less-focused perspective on it, but i guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. people down the hall are getting kind of loud. it kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but i guess it shouldn't because i could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. plus, i know that i'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, i need to get my guitar out of dave's trunk so i can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the happening, i need to be better. i'm wondering if i'm doing this assignment right. i mean, am i supposed to record what i think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should i record that too? i guess i'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. my fingers are going to get tired of typing. i feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. i guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. my fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. i'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but i love fall and winter, and i'm actually really excited about it. i wonder if i was reading this if i would think i am a negative person. i mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. i'm actually a really happy person, i don't know why i complain so much. i wonder if i do that in everyday conversation, too. i guess i'm kind of whiny, but i catch myself doing it so i stop-plus, people know that i'm not really serious about it, i just like to make noise sometimes. rrooooh, i like popping my knuckles-there i go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what i came up with to be positive. i just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when i get old. oh well, it's a habit i can't seem to break. on my desk i have pictures of my cousins. they are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. i love them. just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. there is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. she's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. everybody laughs at that picture, including me. there is also pictures of a church retreat i did called happening. i love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. i'm so glad that i'm saved. i used to never use that phrase bc i thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. where would my life be without christ? i just don't know. he brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. i wish i could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because i know people who need christ (well, we all do, but i mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who i most want to tell about him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't ""preach"" to other people, and they would resent it if i tried to tell them. they don't realize that i just want to share-""i know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. "" (song lyrics) but i'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. my intentions are pure. it's not like i'm on commission-one extra year in heaven for every person you bring to christ-i just care about people and the lord, and i want to serve him and help them. it's the truth, you know? if only i could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think i'm false or that i'm just trying to glorify myself because i'm not. ""what do i care about pleasing men? if i wanted to please men, i would not be a servant of god. "" gal 1:10 that's reagan's favorite verse. hmmm, i wonder if reagan is back in town yet. he went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. i should call him tonight, and now my 20 minutes are up so i can do that! wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went!

"well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. i've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when i got here i had no clue it was going to be just what i thought is was going to be like. needless to say, i'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. i'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that god sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and i had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but i guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh? i'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. i'm busy as it is. friends will come. i wish matt from orientation calls me. i think we could be really good friends. i'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. i just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. i just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. i absolutely love college but i guess i miss all of the tight friendships i had and my little group at school. but i love everything about college (except for the showers) :) well, that's it for now. besides the fact that i wish i had some significant other. or maybe i don't. sometimes i wish i did but i still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and i'm still meeting people now so i guess it's good i'm not tied down. and i'm really excited i found a theater club i could join here. and i don't have to major in theater. i did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but i was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. i'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. i miss my friends and family the most. i'm not really homesick yet, which is good i think. i think that shows a sign of maturity. i'm not going home this weekend. i know my parents would want me to but i don't really feel like it yet. i propbably will the next weekend maybe. i know i am for our high school's homecoming for sure. i think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. i think that it will be fun. i loved high school football games. i went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 20 minutes. until writing #2.

"alright, well right now i have no idea what to write. i don't know what my professor is expecting this to say and i do not know what all of the other students are writing about. i don't really want to get too personal just in case i get to be the lucky one who's homework is spotchecked. i am worrying that school is not being focused on as much as it should be. i sometimes think that i am going to be able to get by as easily as i did in high school when at the same time i know that that is not the case at all. i know that i am going to have to study so much more than i ever have and it freaks me out. especially since i am not so sure that i know exactly how to study. i don't want to go into an exam thinking that i know all the information and then have no clue what the test is saying to me. i want to do so well this semester and in a way i have to if i want to transfer into the school of communications next semester. and the fact that i heard the other day that professor pennebaker is the hardest psychology teacher here did not help much. i didn't think he seemed that hard but apparently he is. and i also am freaking out about the whole sorority thing. i am having so much fun with it but it is taking up a lot of my time and so are all of the parties that go with it. i have to decide whether or not i want to go home on saturday for the night. i want to see my parents and my friends but i don't know if it is worth it. and also i don't want to get really sad when i am there. i am worried that i am not going to really want to come back. that is not saying that i am not having such a fun time here but i think that me not wanting to come back after a night at home is a possibility. i am having so much fun here but it is a lot of stuff to deal with sometimes. and it is like i am never capable of being alone. and when i am alone, its when i don't really want to be alone. there are always things going on and people around when i just want to relax and sit down. but that is never possible. and there is so much to do all the time that studying is so hard to fit into my schedule. but i do have to admit that i am studying because i know i am more than some of my friends. friends is another thing that kind of scares me. i hope that my best friends from home and i don't lose touch just because there are so many new faces here and everyone is wanting to meet new people. i just kind of wish that i knew who my group of friends is going to be so that i can start hanging out with them and making memories that are going to count. okay, well i hope that this is what you expected from my 20 minutes of writing because i had no idea what else to write. now maybe you can look at the way my brain works and help me deal with my problems.

"wow. i have a lot of books. ok, it's about 10:04. i tried to start this thing a while ago, around 8, but my girlfriend is over, and i'm helping her learn german. i've had a lot of german classes. anyway, i'm going to marry her. sometimes i'm afraid of the commitment, and the choice, but every time i'm with her, she makes me feel confident. when we go play tennis, study (as we are doing right now), or just about anything really. hmm. hsinju got the job at the noc. i don't know if bobby is just putting on a kind facade or what. so many guys are like that. maybe females, but i never really know. but guys are. they are great and pleasant until they're in the company of other men. wasn't that a movie? in the company of men. yes. had a yellow and red cover to it, i think. speaking of which, i need to watch those videos from vulcan. what a great place. cheap too. no quite as cheap as my dad's though. i wonder what rpm is going to be like when the evil giant faceless megacorporation finally gets its butt in gear. it seems like i've spent my entire life fighting against corporate america. fuck blockbuster, fuck starbucks. but now that they have bought out rpm records. well, i'm glad my dad can retire in ease with all that dough. but i feel like i've betrayed myself. how can i be so gleeful about it? sure, rpm fought the system, and won. we never went out of business. several times, the megacorporations had to buy us out, not boot us out. but it's kind of like becoming a traitor for some quick cash. like judas. that was one hell of a judas kiss. $250,000. wow. anyway, i really hope my semester pans out well. i'm really liking the idea of the english teacher class i'm taking. the teacher seems friendly. reminds me a lot of mrs. hagar. and what luck, a german in there too! woher aus deutschland kommst du, mein neue freund? i think it will be exciting to get to practice my german. that reminds me, i need to go drop that ger 218 class i'm taking. i don't think i'll really like it. and i can get enough practice helping stacey anyway. i wonder what i should add. so much is riding on these up coming semesters. did i mention i love my baby? i'm going to propose to her sometime in october. on a hot air balloon, with a large banner on the ground that says, ""will you marry me?"" i think it will be great. so romantic. except for the balloon operator. stacey has low self esteem though, at least when it comes to academia. she's so smart, but she just needs to practice. at whatever. she's goofy too. so much fun. i'm actually getting a bit tired. i've been writing for about ten minutes now. i think i want another drink. that crangrape juice was good. hmm. sleep would be good. tennis would too. i think i'm too tired for tennis tonight. i may fall asleep during the movie. studying and writing is tiring. i don't miss home. garland, that is. austin is great. so much better than that rotten place. everyone there, my age at least, had one single goal: undermine everyone else. ugh. it's been 20 minutes. bye.

"today was an easy day for me since i only had two classes to attend. in math, i really had a hard time staying awake. i didn't know if it was because i knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. either way, i was very tired and at times, i just dozed off. in my edp class, i had to find information on financial aide. i also had to start a checking account at the credit union. by chance in the corner of my eyes, i could a brochure on financial loans for students. so i picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. right now i'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on friday. it's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. i probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. english at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. i had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. i tries to call tex many times, but had no luck. now i have to get used to waking up early every tuesday and thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. it's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that i can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. i really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on wednesday, i didn't take one and when i attended the class, i had a hard time staying awake. i'm glad that i'm in college now because i feel more independent than at home. my mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. but it gets to a point where i kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick. i can't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother. i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it. he still thinks he can beat me, but that won't probably ever be true until i'm about 60 and he's 57. this weekend, i hope to attend the football game with my friends again. i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot. it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before. it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. i might even paint my face to show some school spirit. maybe not. after i finish this assignment, i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday. i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment. the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it. my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. i think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. i guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo's was out of them. textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. i think my time is up so that's all i'm going to write. i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that's the purpose of this essay. so, that's all.

"well i'm sitting at my computer and i don't really have much to say. for some reason i feel as though my mind is completely blank. my roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. i am so tired right now. last night i was up with no thoughts in my head. i was just not able to sleep for some reason. i really hope that this school year goes good for me. i know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. i have always dreamt of coming to college and now that i am finally here it still seems like a dream. i guess its just hard to believe that i'm on my own, six hours from home. i miss my old friends and my girlfriend, laura, i can't wait to see here this weekend. football season is about to start and i am getting so excited to see my first longhorn game. my mind just went blank again. no thoughts. i think i just used to many dots between words. my nose itches. i need to use the bathroom, but i still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and i don't want to stop now. for some reason it seems as though i have been here typing for a long time but really i haven't even typed much. maybe i type slow. i'm trying to think of what to type now. it seems so easy. ?just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe i'm trying to hard. the phone is ringing. i guess i'll get it. it is was my mom. yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. that sounds good to me because i could really use it right now. it looks as though i have barely typed anything. i'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. man i'm thirsty. i could use a spite or a cold coke. maybe i'll go get one in a little while, or not cause i need to save money. it's tough not having a job and wanting so much. i'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that i don't even need in the first place. six more minutes and i will be done. it actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. i wonder how my dog is doing. i hope my mom is feeding her just as i said, and giving her lots of water. she needs that especially in the hot sun. i can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. no thoughts. still none. i think i'm getting addicted to the dot thing. two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. every second seems to go by slower and slower now. i really don't want to drive home this weekend. i wish i could fly, but i'll be alright. i just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. well it's been twenty minutes so i guess i'm done.

"my love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as i sit here and write this assignment. i don't understand any software but everything for ibm, and the macintosh is completely foreign to me. i must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey i am new to this whole apple thing. apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. every time i type the word a lot, i am reminded of my english teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. i'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that i should have written it as two. i think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. i see a lot of people around campus just like that although i remember their faces and words, for the life of me i cannot remember their names, and i would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, azi, do you remember me?? more than likely i would not, or i would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. i do that a lot. people will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before i responded by just looking up. my thoughts consume me sometimes. i have a problem with daydreaming. i know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. it is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. i was talking about my thoughts, and how i daydream. well, lately all i can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man i am to marry. it seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. i have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. i went to a summer church retreat, and i think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because i met guys for the first time that i could honestly see myself marrying. this has never happened before, and as i glance around the campus, i just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and i am here longing for there company. it is not like i need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. i miss them a whole lot because i have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that i met at this church retreat in california. i think i forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout cali, and i have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless i actively seek a job to where i can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful golden state of california. all of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and i miss them terribly. i have to go back some day, i haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as i had in california. i know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little bit of why i would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason i would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a baptist church, or a jewish synagogue embodies. that spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. it would be ideal if i could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and i stress this because that is a big part of my life, but i am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. it's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, i am not asking for the ken and barbie playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, i just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. i just don't think that i can have that right now, and that is why i spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. the challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. and if i may i would like to end with a statement that linda ellerbee made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes.

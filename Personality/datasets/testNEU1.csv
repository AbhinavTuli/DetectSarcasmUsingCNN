i just took that pre-testing thing for psychology and it made me think a lot about how i view myself .,it kind of put me in a bad mood because i realized how much i look down on myself .,it was interesting to learn that much about myself just by taking a test .,i do n't know if that was one point of the test but it made me think a lot .,i realized how scared i was at one point about how i am scared to speak up for myself .,i wish i could but i am very worried that i will make a wrong point .,even right now i am scared to write the wrong thing even though there is no right or wrong thing to write .,i love this classical music .,"for some reason it make me more at ease , i can never work without some kind of distraction or something else for my mind to think about .",i wish i could talk to people that i do n't know easier .,i was so scared to walk into my class late today .,i did n't know if my ta was going to get mad but she saw me and so i had to go in anyways .,when i walk around this campus i feel like so small and worthless compared to everyone .,i got lost this morning and i was to scared to ask for directions because i do n't trust they will give me the right way .,i know it makes no sense whatsoever .,it is wierd how different music puts a person in different moods .,"first , i was listening to classical and i felt peaceful and then alternative came on and it made me feel more awake and then jazz came on and it was soothing .",i think listening to a variety of music helps a person be in a mood that they feel like being in .,i do n't know if it is the music that puts the person in a mood or if it is the mood that picks the music that makes them pick the music they feel like listening too .,my classes seem to be discussing sort of the same topic which seems to help in understanding each one more .,i never realized my mind jumps from one thing to another so much .,it is like before i finish one thought i already begin another .,it is hard to concentrate when my roommate is on the phone with her mother right now because i am hearing like four things at once .,i am not used to having to share my space and have someone around all the time .,i guess i am just going to have to get used to it .,i am very jittery right now and i do n't know why .,i think i need to learn how to relax because i am already getting stressed out and i do n't think that is a good thing .,it is wierd i start to look at the clock and it makes me start typing more even though i am not thinking more it makes me just start typing more since i know my time is almost up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.139714 -0.327966 1.063535 -0.595662 0.293088 -1.653064 -0.460628 -0.577278 -0.586352 -0.50714 -0.080949 -0.590446 -0.79243 1.330069 -1.004869 0.0 -0.04277 0.614658 0.95174 -0.795527 0.789931 -0.742368 -0.718403 0.39226 -0.624052 -0.093034 0.898209 0.208015 0.701117 -0.669651 -0.658767 -0.56855 0.773444 2.749584 -0.662896 -0.166035 0.908707 2.169091 2.169829 -0.63621 -1.038726 0.049471 -0.528558 1.323287 0.184338 1.120669 1.206618 -0.664624 1.421121 -1.08424 -0.082681 -0.045626 0.719611 0.848003 -0.634992 -0.525101 -0.092577 -0.156144 -0.47499 -0.489892 -0.026399 -0.842748 -0.480161 -0.231292 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.564185 -1.183422 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.067783 -0.422267 -0.892454 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.454754 4.480056 4.447938 4.717803 5.014028 4.236232,1774

so here goes .,i am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff .,it seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time i have to complete everything just keeps shrinking .,i hope and pray that as time goes by i will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life .,it has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work .,"but as my brother once told me , you must work hard in order to play hard .","i 'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly , and keep thinking positive about my situation .",i 'm hoping that i can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come .,well enough about that .,i 'm really starting to miss my family a lot .,i think that is really lame but i ca n't help it really .,"like i love austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of sunnyvale , texas that i miss incredibly .",i went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends .,gosh i love my friends here but its just not the same .,there is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave .,but i know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals .,and ut is the place to do it .,i love this place !,the people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change .,i am so excited about this weekend !,one of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and i keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend !,gosh you know what .,i 'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15 '' theory !,because i sure do eat a lot these days .,the food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist !,its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you .,no here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it !,its great !,its amazing to me how different college life is from high school .,like in high school everyone cared about everyone else 's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here .,no one cares about anyone else 's business at all .,people are just concerned with themselves .,and another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules !,like you can do whatever the heck you want and no one will tell you that you are wrong or that you ca n't do something .,"oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking , you can !",i laugh every time i see people doing that in my classes .,i would never be able to make myself do that because i 'm too much of a chicken but i think its so funny !,gosh .,i 'm really starting to get hungry again .,that is so bad !,no !,i ca n't eat again !,i am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm .,that is really late and i 'm extremely tired !,i really hope that i can find a date to anchors away .,that is really bugging me .,i wish i knew exactly who i wanted to take and who wanted to go so that i would n't have to worry about it anymore !,alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so i 'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me .,haha !,this was good .,its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once .,i actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper .,not to mention that i feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing i have to worry and stress out about .,well that is all i have to say for myself at this point and time !,peace !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

amazing .,they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and i believe it .,there is just so much to do online .,"i feel like i might be typing bad , but i 'd like you to excuse that .",i 'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing .,"i wonder what you actually look for in these type of things , how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups .","i mean i 'd hate to see what you think of me now , but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true .","so i totally love paris hilton , she is such a riot .",i think its funny people do n't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show .,"but i wont get into that , however she came out with a new book .","i

for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy .,we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music .,its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation .,i 'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed .,i ca n't imagine it not being computer timed .,i ca n't imagine being the person who reads all this crap .,it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important ?,that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail .,but that could happen anywhere i guess .,i 'm so hungry its not funny .,i 'm glad i do n't have to pee or anything that would just suck .,i feel like my mind is going blank because i 'm so bored .,i wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this .,it would be easy .,gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top does n't have any numbers .,like its keeping time per say .,i 'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing does n't stop itself because i know i 'll be over the time if i wait till 4 so you ca n't cut my grade cause your thing did n't work .,oh crap this clock is fast so i 'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even .,i feel like i started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm i ca n't really remember .,damn it .,this sucks ass .,i do n't see how this is helping you .,just making me get annoyed because i do n't know when i started so i dont know

growling stomach'boredom .,ouch i just kicked the computer or something underneath me .,and it hurt .,to bad i 'm not on my computer cause then i could be laying in bed doing this .,wireless and laptops .,genius .,the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting .,3:55 will be the new time for completion .,3 more minutes .,and i 'm stumped .,i do n't know what to type'talk about .,ooooooo 2 minutes and counting .,"ok randomness : i am not sure what i 'm going to do tonight , i might go to a party or something , however i 'm not

tiffany is so wrong i do n't understand anything when it comes to her i,know nothing was fair yet i wanted to believe it was what is wrong with me it is funny how things that are so important matter to no one else and although someone can have empathy they still do n't understand everything is different i want to know what to,do i know that is not possible it bothers me i need to do good in school i want to be someone who be comfortable i guess relying on money is what i have for now i just feel that i would be proud to support a family the way,i want them to be supported but will that affect the way they are going to be brought up i want to be a good father i want to do so much but i would do nothing if i could just have some answers if i could be certain for,once man i miss the old days but at the same time i do look towards the future i do think about how things will be different how i do n't know what the future holds and who knows it could be good or bad i learn either way i,feel i am learning a lot and changing that is what i love i want to change to a better person i guess better can only be what i hold as better not society so i guess what i am saying is that i want to be secure of myself,i want to be sure i know i can figure something out i know nothing is going to be easy about it and i do n't expect immediate results i just want to make something of myself but i want to have answers and i want to have love all,these things confuse me and make me feel alone i have to work on them it seems everything else is so trivial so pointless i do n't know though i have yet to figure out what i want my future foundations to be i am trying to be picky because,it is me i think society has some things wrong of course i mean it is democracy majority wins i do n't think the majority is always right although they do count for some things this topic just blows me away i mean why do people do drugs and alcohol,people have many different reasons i think if everyone can be responsible and do it to enjoy themselves if it possible i think it is okay i do n't know though i do n't really know anyone who can but i have n't thought much of the subject i mean,i particularly think that alcohol is worse then marijuana i know both are not good for your body i wonder if it therapeutic in any way though how they allow that temporary escape i know you should deal with your problems and not run and it is harmful to be,trapped by hiding in substance abuse but sometimes you things take time and maybe substance abuse can be used as therapeutic i do n't know maybe i am full of it sometimes i feel i know what i can handle i know there are limits to be set and i,feel i can exceed some i feel everyone has there own limits and i feel those people who can not respect there limits are the reason for the universal set of limits makes me kind of mad but that is okay of course it would happen but i wish the,limits i wish i could push sometimes could be understandable although i know they ca n't i know what they are and if i do n't that is how i find out so maybe it is n't so bad to push the limit you find out where you go overboard,and you can build from that and help others then again sometimes you are only one chance and sometimes it is only luck keeping you from screwing everything up when test limits i mean everyone test limits i just feel more respect for people who know there limits i would, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"okay , my thoughts .","a jumble right now , let 's see if i can sort them out .","my feelings are peaceful array , overwhelmed , giving god praise and glory for his awesomeness .","i just looked at a person , just looked at his face , tried to figure out if he was good-looking or not and then punished myself for doing it because i have a guy , i need to stop looking at others .","or do i , confusion is going on in there right now but also a peace or something that is covering over all of it .",put there by god i know his truth will come out in time .,"i am suppressing something , a feeling i have a lot .","suppressing emotions , bad things , allowing myself to think of something ?","i do n't know , is it a discipline to control the mind .",deep down is that constant .,"god is there watching loving taking care of me , his will is at the center , my will fighting with his will , but another side of me so wanting him to take over and control my whole life .","i am tired , but why ?",i slept in until 9:00a .,"m. today , i should n't be tired , i wonder if the sky and weather outside have anything to do with it ?",a little bit down .,i did n't hear from jeromed today yet .,"always that little doubt , is he given up ?","but i doubt but deep deep down i know ther is something there holding it so strong , or stopping me from worrying and getting taken over by it , a holding on so hard to god and knowing that what he has deemed right and true will come for",i have given him my life to be in control of .,why did that psychology test ask such dumb questions ?,i mean about sex and just assuming that everyone has had it and asking about it .,i feel a little bit dirty considering and thinking about those different types of sex there are .,"i am pure , a virgin and i plan to stay that way until marriage .","it is so sad , but those types of people must be rare in the world today , i have been secluded from the real world it seems , well kind-of , not too much .",actually what is the real world .,i 'm thinking and holding onto the fact that actually the way god sees things is the real world .,we can blind ourselves so easily to what is real and fake and what really does or does n't matter .,people care so much about nothing .,"things that wo n't last things that wo n't follow aor come with them after they die , now i 'm getting bored with this subject but i want to finish it out .",i so desire my roommates to come to know christ .,"i am worried about my witness and just as i live what i portray , today 's society does n't care about who or what you worship , oh it 's all good , hey that 's great you believe in this and she in that and i in this","how sad is that , the truth is god , but also people wo n't accept that unless god is there working , what does convince a person to become a christian or is that the right words to use , now onto camp , a picture of the campfire","with boys all around it , the orange nice comforting mysterious warm flames in the middle of a set of logs and as i approach it down the steep hill i hear jabbering and talking and i see the beautiful red , orange , pink cloud overhead , how is",that so beautiful ?,how do those colors come out ?,"i do n't know , but it is awesome !","then i see the staff , jerome , susan , nicole ( she most prevelently ) , holly , and others .","then i sit next to jerome and my heart just warms up , i do n't know what to say or where to look and i 'm just glad i 'm next to him , we ca n't touch , do n't let the kids know that we are dating",", it would be better if they did n't know about this , jerome had said , okay , with god 's help i can behave myself .","it 's not that hard to make myself do something , good .","we sit there and i just glance at him and his one yellow and blue eye and his other blue eye , how in the world did someone so handsome and with so much integrity and love come to want me and want to date me and care for me","i do n't know , i have no idea about myself , it 's just me and though , me , a continuous struggle and fight to let god rule and reign or me to take over .",again how is christ going to shine .,"i do n't want to change with god and though deep down he is there and it seems nothing will change that , but how do i know what will happen in the future ?","i do n't , but the one person i do know and is always there is in the future now and knows .","all-knowing , all-powerful , everywhere , god !","not myself , i ca n't ever be god i am so fallible and a sinner !",only god !,"okay , just looked at the clock and actually i am enjoying this writing all my thoughts .",at the beginning i was skeptical of this whole assignment .,why should i focus on myself ?,"anyway , it is fun to put into words my thoughts and interesting what i actually think about within 20 minutes .",it seems a lot of jerome and of god and issues .,these are my thougts for the last 20 minutes .,hmmm !, , , , , , , , , , , ,

the world just as happy as could be .,that is how i am feeling right now that is why i am writing about him .,i think about him all the time .,when we are not together i wish we were .,i can never be without him and not be missing him .,"he is just so funny , hes so cute , hes so wonderful .",i wish he were here with me right now .,he is caring and loving and we have a great time when we are together from when we are kissing to hugging to playing board games with his family .,"when i came home from his house i was going to try to send a card to my friend for his birthday , but when i was looking online for cards to send i was beginning to get frustrated that i could not find any that i liked so i",started looking at other cards like pictures of cute babies that people had sent .,i love to be around children and they seem to like me too .,i hope to have some of my own one day .,but that will be after college .,"i want to wait til i am married , that is very important to me .",even though sometimes i have to admit it is not easy .,me and my boyfriend have talked about getting married one day .,i really wish he was here right now .,but hes at the store with his mom shopping because she does not feel very well right now .,i love his family so much .,his parents are 2 of the most awesome christian people and the cutest couple you will ever meet .,if me and my boyfreind do get married i want to be just like them .,they have been married like 20 something years and are still completely in love with eachother like they had just started thier relationship togehter .,you can see in in how they look at eachother how they talk to eachother just eerything about them .,davids sisters are amazing too .,they are truely a lot of fun .,they are 28 and almost 31 years old .,so they are quite a bit older than he is .,whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that .,i think they think we will get married some day too .,i hope we do .,when i first started dating him even within the first couple of weeks i could already sit in his house and picture bringing the kids over to the grandparents house .,his

and can depend on eachother for anything .,she even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when i started dating david and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that she had a good feeling about this one .,meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time .,and so far she is right and i do n't see her being wrong any time soon .,i am glad that i still live at home while i am going to ut because i do n't know where i would be without her .,i am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at

"i 've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people , using them as test subjects , objectifying human beings , i really feel that it degrades their very being .",i do n't understand another human 's need to study and examine what makes another human tick .,"i wish that i could say that i am exempt from this curiosity , but sadly i am not .","i find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs , in causes , in religion .","they somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they 're involved in is important , means something , when in reality 100 % of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them .","none of it will rally matter once these people are gone , and the strange thing is that i think they all know this deep down , they 've all had that thought in their life before .","yet they still go on , slaving their lives away , building the modern day pharaoh 's modern day pyramids .",just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth .,god only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations .,"which raises another good topic , religion , now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups , just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way .","religion as we know it was made to control the masses , sort of a justification for law , and also something that keeps people inline above law , like a conscience .",but the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake .,we teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction .,"it 's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters , as if one is even different that the others , they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy , keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to",a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives .,"in tribal societies religion does n't have to be forced on the new generation , rather they welcome it with open arms , just as they are n't forced to work in their lives , rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your",own society .,"people allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me , it 's clear that people can live , sustain life , off very little , and will slave their lives away rather than die .","however i ca n't comprehend how our society got to this point , where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass .","we somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones , computers , tv 's , cars , when it 's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago .","people actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years , people just like you and me , people just as smart , and just as naive .","it 's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around , the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians , but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live , that we have so enlighten found .",people lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we could n't live without for nearly 3 million years .,"but those are all things that no one wants you to know , except maybe daniel quinn , derrick jensen , john zerzan , and chuck palahniuk .",those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it is n't already too late .,"the doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now , that is the point of no return , if things stay the way that they are now , there will be no hope for the future .","if we had all just stayed with animism , and believed that the earth is not something for us to own , or control , if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives","so that we may survive , how could we take away their right to the same land we live on .","but there are no classes teaching what people really want to know , what they need to know , only classes perpetuating our way of life .",only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we do n't even notice .,so why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world .,"now i realize that my writing may sound bleak , as if i 'm in a state of utter depression , that i 'm innately sad , but it 's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should , and deserves to feel the",depression that haunts us all .,"we keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks , making executioner executive decisions .","but humans should n't need pills to control their feelings , they should n't need pills to make them happy , they should n't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission .","it pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society , and the people that do n't see it , if it is n't already here .","our phones are tapped , our emails are spied on , the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous .","people wake up everyday and take zoloft , prosac , ritalin , adderol , valium , zanex , anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior , to keep them inline .","anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is , anything to keep them so fucked up they just do n't care anymore .","anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out , there is no hope for the future we are writing now , at least none that includes us .","for a species that holds it self in such hich regard , the top of the food chain , the center of the universe , in our own special classification , we sure act stupidly .","if we were to open our eyes we 'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions , with drugged up kids , both pharasudically , and illegally , allowing oppression , deforestation , slavery , pollution , and the lot to continue everyday",", infact they make sure it grows , because you ca n't stop progress .","they are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save '' by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission , so that they may enter an endless world of",happiness once their life here is over .,"i 'm here to tell you that no such place exists , god is just santa clause for adults .","where was god when the twin towers were hit , where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man , where was god when the germans were killing the jews , where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are",born that they do n't even notice when they 're doing it to their own children .,i for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land .,"everyday we scorch the earth with new roads , we rip the earth apart for new buildings , we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system .","no one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here , before civilization no one had to work , in fact tribal people have no concept of work , they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time","living , doing whatever it is that they want to .","we have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable , lazy , pointless , a waste , yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless , just as wasteful .","only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born , because the way we live is so heinous , so vile , so wrong that our children ca n't handle it , and for the most part neither can we .","we could change everything in one generation , if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself , but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right , that this is the way things must",be and that there 's nothing we can do about it ., , , , ,

i am often asked what i am thinking about at the moment and i can never put them into words or many time i do n't ' want to but i guess i am forced to right now .,i am at home right now for the labor day holiday and all i 've been doing is homeowrk .,whoever said that college was going to be fun was wrong .,or so i think .,i 'm constantly going to classes and when i 'm not i 'm doing homework related to it .,well i guess i ca n't say that college is all bad .,i have been to my share of parties and those are always fun except for soem of the people you meet .,especially those stupid thug guys who think they are all that .,they walk aroung with their pants about to fall off with their friends talkign abotu how many girls they are going to sleep with this year .,"and what the funny aprt is , spome of the girls are actually attracted to those greasy guys .",they are constantly after then and soem of them even fight over them .,some of these guys have been in jail like 6 times and can barely even read .,do n't these epople ever wonder about what they are going to do with thte rest of their life or is that just a foriegn concept that they just ca n't learn ?,"i do n't ' know why i am bitching about this , i just find it a little ridiculous how girls are always chasing after guys who are idiots .",and besides that why are girls always trying to impress guys .,i do n't know why i 'm going off abotu this .,i 'm not a feminist who is totally against guys or anything .,actually i 'm the total opposite .,"but anyways , when ever i 'm asked to talk abotu what i 'm thinking about i go blank .",i ca n't seem to think abotu anything .,but one thing has coem to me .,my aunt was ina coma for over a year and dies justa couple of months ago .,i always think abotu her and my uncle and cousin .,i feel so bafd for my cousin .,he is only 2 years old and he is never going to get to know his mother .,a lot of us take that forgranted and that really irritates me .,i am hindu and we believe in reincarnation and when soemthing horrible happens it makes you wonder what happened in past lives to cause he such misery .,we believe that you are punished for your wrongdoings in your next life but life does improve for you every time .,"supposedly you becoem a better person each time and everyone works towards a common goal and that goal is to be truly happy , just and basically as close to perfect as you can get .",every life makes you better and helps you move closer to that goal .,"but of coarse it takes more times for some than others , i think .",lately i have been discussing my religion a lot .,i met this guy who never knew anyone who was hindu .,he just found that so fascinating and i could n't believe that someone had never met a hindu .,that kinda shows how segregated we all are and how we tend to stay within our same culture and try not to stray to far from it .,"i mean i have many friends who are not indian and i have no prooblem with any kind of race , but i do have to admit that i do tend to be better friends and stay closer to those of the smae culture .",i think this is true of a lot of peopel and not just me .,but there are very few who are willing to accept this fact .,one thing that does annoy me abotu this is how some people treat me liek i 'm stupid until they learn that i was born in america .,i see a lot of racism with my parents because they do have an accent and that really gets me mad .,if anyone is ever disrespectign my mother in front of me i will let them know and trust me i am not soft spoken .,i do n't ' know where people get off thinking that they are better than us .,my parents came from india with very little money and now if i may say so my self we are probably more successful than those fools who feel that they have to show that they are better than us .,"anyways , on to a more lighter topic , psycology .",have i mentioned that i think that it is one of my favorite classes even though there is 500 people in it .,and i 'm not just saying it to suck up or anything but i really do enjoy it and i look forward to comign to it everytime .,its not one of those boring classes where all we do is sit there and take notes .,even with such a big classthere is a lot of interaction which is really important to me .,well my time is up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

not .,i do n't see why someone who had five years of math in high school ( ) algebra in 8th which was a high school course offered for gt ) has to take a stupid test .,if i was n't good in math i would n't have had five years of it and passed nor would i be an engineering major .,who knows .,i called the department of mathematics and asked them about it .,i tried to get a number so my teacher could call and try to see of something could be worked out and they were extremely rude to me .,so i called the measurements and evaluations \center and they told me to call the department of mathematics .,my teacher said `` welcome to ut '' this is a wonderful idea to have a writing assignment of continual thought because i can just vent about the worst first day of class i have ever had in my entire life .,i have strong feelings that it will get better because it can not get worse .,i know that the first semester is the hardest but right know i do n't care .,"while i was studying , i was thinking about the kids that went off to college and came back at christmas and visited about their first semester at school .",everything they said does n't ' pertain to me .,nothing they said pertained to me .,i thought about what i would say if i was ever asked to speak about my first semester at college .,my calculus teacher stressed \over and over how we need to take the ap test .,he said that we would slack off because we already knew it .,for me i need this semester review .,i love math and work hard at it .,it does n't come easy to me but i love it and no matter how hard something is if you love it you will work your darndest at it to achieve the highest possible .,"so i was thinking about if my calculus teacher asked me to come to his class what i would say if someone asked me why i did n't the ap test and if it were a smart decision , ( that was my cat walking across the key board .",) he wants outside because he knows that there are other cats outside and he wants to attack them .,he 's a 10 week orange tabby cat named bevo-talk about school spirit .,i think that i would answer the ap question as one that it is a personal decision .,my boyfriend ap out of 408c and said that was the worst thing he did .,some people are happy they did .,another guy from home ap out of 36 hours and went to m & a and came home because he failed everything but pe .,my \philosophy is that i need to start from the beginning in order to get used to things .,", so what if i have already gone over this in high school i do n't care .",why make things hard on myself with new material my first semester it 's not like i 'm going to graduate in 4 years anyway .,i figured that if i took my basic chemistry and calculus things i know that i could get used to teaching styles college life and testing style .,"i will have to study and i know this real well , but it wo n't be all new to me .","well i started at 10:35 and it 's 10:55. , i do have one question though , if we participate in more than five hours of experimental stuff for our semester requirement can we get extra credit for that extra hour ( s ) ?",that 's all folks .,good-bye and good luck ., , , , , , , ,

"stream of consciousness well , in other words , free association .",i can accommodate this assignment .,it 's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied .,"as i was walking home from a stressful day of calculus , chemistry , and psychology , i passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building .",the animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking .,"on normal circumstances , squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans .","however , this squirrel continued to hunt for food as i walked by it .","i stopped and watched it , it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object , try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent .","curious i continued to watch , wondering what else it would do .","i approached the squirrel , closer and closer .","when i had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground , attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings .",fantastic !,i never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself .,i had always thought they would run and jump away .,i remained crouched on the sidewalk as i continued to watch this curious little squirrel .,after some time it started slowly approaching me .,"i continued to watch it , much like a predator stalking its prey .",without motion or movement i crouched and stared at it .,it came to within 18 inches of me .,how wonderful !,the squirrel was n't afraid to come towards a human .,it remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel .,of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances .,i was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel .,"at one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street , it found a mass of dumped bread .",the rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory .,once there the squirrel began to eat .,"after eating half of the portions , he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread .","not finding a place , i began to try to help .",i grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel .,i realized i was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building .,i was trying to help my new little friend .,"finally , after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people .","i felt anger , why would someone do that , i 'm interacting with this squirrel .","after it ran into the tree , it did n't come back down .",at some point i left .,"in retrospect , i think i spent almost 40 minutes observing the squirrel .","i was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions , but afterwards , amazingly , i was calm and i actually had an enjoyable time playing with it .",i also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel .,"i never knew that they were as smart as i observed , i also realized even more what incredible running , jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have .","some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste , but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening .",many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world .,a squirrel having so many complexities .,amazing .,what about the human being or the human mind .,the complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible !,so many questions .,it 's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting .,wow very very

new people .,i want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a persian club .,that would be fun .,i want to meet some persian people on campus since i am persian too .,its fun to meet someone from

i just set my alarm on the cell phone because i did n't want to over write or something .,i 'm listening to fiona apple 's song .,"it 's called across the universe , i think .",i do n't know if i was supposed to put quotations around the title of the song .,"yes , i 'm sure that 's what i was supposed to do .",this writing assignment is kind of weird cause i do n't know what i 'm supposed to be writing about and sometimes this freedom makes me kind of weird on the subject .,"too much freedom is n't always comfortable , i guess .",i ca n't stop thinking about how bad i feel that i did n't go to my philosophy class on tuesday .,it 's not because the professor sucks .,or at least i do n't think it is cause i know he does kind of not get the point across .,he 's too vague .,too much vagueness and too much freedom .,both are not good especially if you want structure .,i need structure in my life .,i do because sometimes i think that i know what i 'm doing and what i want to do but it just does n't work out that way and i think it 's because i just want things to be scheduled or i ca n't get them done .,"i do n't ' know how to structure my life , though .",this song makes me so depressed even though i like it a lot .,i do n't know what to write about .,"i do n't know if i 'm supposed to continuously type , without stopping , or if i can stop to think about what i want to write about but not get away from the computer .","i feel like my writing is n't quality writing here , but i guess that 's the point of writing this .",i 've been writing for four minutes .,i know .,i stopped to look at the clock .,i want to talk to my boyfriend .,we got into a fight today because he was upset that i did n't call him and went over to a friend 's dorm room .,i know that 's not what he 's upset about though .,i know it 's because this friend of mine is a guy .,i hate that he 's so jealous like that .,"i mean , i do n't mind if he wants to show me that he cares , but getting upset with me and hanging up with me like that , i just do n't like .",especially embarrassing me in front of my friend .,"i 've known my friend , jonathan , longer than i have been with my boyfriend .",i do n't ' know .,i guess my boyfriend is just paranoid .,i love him a lot though .,i just wish we had what we had in the beginning of our relationship : blind love and trust .,i do n't know .,"i guess that once you go out with someone for so long , things just fly away and you 're left with what you always thought you were n't going to do and be and say and feel .",i understand why some women cry about their husbands beating them but yet they do n't leave .,it 's called love with a condition .,she loves him because she 's been with him for so long .,"i 'm thinking that maybe if i did n't type so fast , i would n't end up with too much for this writing assignment .","first of all , i think this is the coolest writing assignment .","not only because we have this freedom , which i think can get a little demanding .",i think it 's neat because we can write what we think .,it is n't an essay on the revolution of blah blah .,"it 's what i feel and think and want to say , which is always nice , especially in writing .",i 'm used to doing this though i guess cause i write in my journal often .,"i never type though , so i guess i 'm getting more said .","and believe it or not , i always worry about space on my journal .","like , i worry that i 'll `` waste '' too many spaces on only one entry .",i think i 'm so weird .,i guess i do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much .,i am like that in many ways i guess .,but i 'm also guessing it 's a better trait to have than not .,i do n't know .,my computer is making funny noises .,i hate my computer cause i paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it does n't even shut down properly .,"plus , stupid dell wo n't help me any .",i write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that do n't even work .,i 've already tried a million times .,it makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk .,i miss home .,i wish i could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight .,i 'm gaining so much weight .,i lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that i looked anorexic .,"now that i 'm in austin , i 've already gained those ten back and i 'm scared that now i 'll turn into too big of a girl , that ill be that girl , the bigger one than all the other girls .","i was only maybe 110 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 90 , i looked bigger .",maybe that 's why they never wanted to go out with me .,i do n't know .,"maybe it 's cause i 'm korean , i do n't look like most of the people where i 'm from .",the rio grande valley : either you 're mexican or some type of mexican .,even the general white population was considered a minority there .,anyway but yeah i used to be cheerleader'student council president and all other kinds of stuff in junior high and i got to high school and cheerleading sucked because i was a freshman and everything else sucked .,all my friends turned into druggies .,about half of them went to rehab .,i feel bad for them .,but then again .,i do n't know .,they 're here at ut with me .,"well , most of them .",does that mean i 'm almost equivalent to a druggie ?,i 've never done any drug besides drinking and smoking cigarettes and even that i do n't do often .,i wish i could find answers to some stupid questions that are so insignificant .,whatever .,all i know is that i want my future to bright and successful .,i actually want to write .,"i want to sit and write my poems and my thoughts and write a book , but i know that wo n't ever be possible .","i would n't ' be able to do it as my job , my career .","i know i need food to eat and money to pay bills with and writing books , especially when you 're barely starting off , wo n't get you too much on the table and in your pockets .",i do n't know .,"i wish i had the patience to go through medical school but i do n't think i could , and besides , i suck at sciences .",i would never be able to go through all those damn chemistry and biology classes .,i would die .,i really would .,why would i want to shoot so high for a career that will only bog me down with way too many hours ?,"actually , the guy i was talking about before , jonathan , he has an uncle who is a doctor and he 's so rich and makes his own hours , basically .","he 's working in the er right now because he likes to travel , and er doctors can usually go work at whatever hospital .",i 'm so tired .,my shoulders hurt .,my boyfriend is coming tomorrow to see me .,i 'm so excited .,we 've been going out for two years .,"it 's like we 're both from the valley and it 's like i 'm going to be able to see a part of the old me , at home .","i have n't seen him for two weeks , which is nothing compared to the long separation periods when i was a senior in high school and he was a freshman up at a & m .","yup , he 's an aggie .",funny how i got to be a longhorn .,i do n't even have all that pride in being one .,i did n't even look into buying a sports packet to go watch the game .,i wish i was back to being my peppy self like i was in junior high .,did i kill myself ?,or did i let other people kill me ?,did i let other people tell me i was n't good enough ?,i do n't know .,i want it to be 9:24 so i can stop writing .,my shoulders hurt and my neck hurts .,i feel too pressured doing this .,"but yet , i like this writing assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"well , i figured i should write this right now while i have time .",i am really busy lately .,it kind of seems like i have no time for myself anymore .,i am trying out for crew .,there are a lot of people trying out though .,i think like 130 people are going for 32 spots .,i hope i make it though because i do n't deal well with failure .,"i tried out for the soccer team and did not make it , but that was a little unfair because i did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did .",so now everyone probably thinks i just was n't good enough when that really was not the reason .,i was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill .,oh well .,i guess it taught me how to cope with failure .,but it really hurts every time i fail .,i tried to get into the business school and was denied .,that got me so mad .,there are all of these total morons in the business school .,i know because i take classes with them and always make better grades than them .,"but alas , they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school .",oh well .,i am still going pre-law so it does n't matter .,"unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it , so it is a constant reminder that i did not get in .",but i think that all of this just makes me a stronger person .,i am trying to be really involved this year .,i am lifeguarding for the rec center .,"it is kind of fun , but i kind of dread going to work all the time .",i just seem to have a lot of things on my plate .,i had a fight with my boyfriend the other day .,i am not sure if it was his fault or if i caused it because of all the stress i am under .,oh well .,i think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too .,"last year we used to be like best friends , but now things are different .",she seems to be really distant .,i am not sure what is wrong with her .,maybe it is my fault .,"i am not around as much as i used to be , so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere .","she also has a boyfriend , so she spends a lot of time with him , which is fine with me .",i just feel like things have totally changed .,she went to a party last night and did n't invite me .,weird .,i think i am really different from most people .,i always seem to put everyone else 's feelings before mine .,i just do n't understand why people do n't do that .,or maybe i do n't understand why i do that .,"like , i would invite everyone to come with me if i was doing something cool .",but all the people around me just i think are selfish .,maybe i just need to find a whole new group of friends .,"i mean , i had my first day of tryouts for crew , which was a pretty big deal to me .","and when i see my boyfriend , he does n't even ask how i did .",he totally forgot about it .,that gets me so mad .,he seems to forget about everything .,he then says how he is a bad boyfriend .,"unfortunately , i have to agree with him .",but do n't get the wrong impression of me .,i am actually a very happy person .,i am just going through a lull right now .,once i get into a normal routine in my life i think i will be a lot happier .,i just wish that my family was here .,"my parents live in virginia , and it is hard with them so far away .",at least my brother is here with me .,that makes it a lot easier .,i do n't know what i would do if he was n't here .,i never realized how dependent i was on other people .,"i always thought of myself as a kind of loner , but i guess i really am not .","i like being around people , and maybe i do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me .",i think i really need to work on the jealousy thing .,that is probably why i am having problems with my boyfriend .,"he finally made some friends here , so he hangs out with them .",i think i also do n't really trust him .,i do n't want him sharing intimate things about us to them .,he was asking me the other day why i back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it .,i just do n't like talking about it .,"i consider it a private thing , and should just be shared between two people .",it is nobody else 's business .,"but i guess since we are in college , that is the way things are .",sex is on everyone 's mind .,but it just does n't really seem to be on my mind very much .,i would much rather just cuddle that have sex .,"maybe i am weird , i do n't know .",but that drives my boyfriend crazy .,he want 's to have sex all the time .,i think that is a major problem in our relationship .,oh well .,"well , i guess my time is about up .",i now have to go to crew again .,i should do good today because it is strength training .,i am pretty confident about that .,"well , i guess i only have one more of these to write .",that relieves

i just got a brand new phone",", it is a really cool camera phone , sometimes i hate having my cell phone because people just wo n't stop calling me and it gets really irritating , especially if you do n't want to speak to the person who keeps calling you .","i met this one girl amy , and she called me so many times but the problem was i was trying to avoid her because i was not ' really interested in her .",but i did n't want to hurt her feelings because i know there are times when i have felt lonely or hurt myself .,anyways i would rather too many people call me then nobody call me

for some time now because she desperately wants me to learn something .,she owns a translation company and thinks it is vital that i be able to communicate at least in spanish if i am going to live in texas .,i really do agree with her but i do n't really want to learn a foreign language .,i took french in high school and it was really tough .,but maybe that was because i did n't really work hard my first two years of high school and i never really paid attention in class .,maybe i will be better now .,anyways before when i was asked to do similar assignments i never was really able to write anything down .,i remember one time i was asked to just write nonstop and then later what ever i wrote about i would use later for the topic of a story .,the problem is that i really was n't able to

or that they went to my high school .,my eating pattern since i got to college has taken a weird pattern-back to my no breakfast-i have 14 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times i will only use 5-10 of my meals a week and that is being generous .,"the first week i had 10 meals left , last week i had 6 or 7 meals left .","i am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me , he can use one of my tickets but he wo n't come because 2 years ago he got kicked out of towers and i guess he is afraid of going back .",somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward 's way .,he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time .,"he is by no means a bad person , he just does n't like to be told what he can and ca n't do if he does n't agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else 's time schedule .","he use to be different , he use to be such a little goody good , he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp , i use to hate him when we were little and then other times i would love him but",mostly i would hate him .,"now i think he is one of my best friends-i think that this is because ever since i have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me , he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel","welcome and special , my parents will say the exact opposite about him , they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate-they fight a lot-and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they do n't see things that i see .",i am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since i have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time .,"my parents will say that this is his specialty-relaxing and having a good time-they think he is really lazy and ca n't be bothered to ever move , but actually i have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task , since","i 've been in austin it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis , and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women-this is not by chance .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

reading through the unintelligable thought processes of mark 's mind .",i hope that no one reads this seriously at all .,"ok now someone is watching me type , oh they 're gone .","that was fast , i 'm telling you this is a waste of time and i 'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes .",i 'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little .,i miss my wife .,yeah that 's right my wife .,we are n't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and i do .,i certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because i actually do take it very seriously .,"i love her more than life , more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath .",now i 'll write about pizza hut .,they got this buffet that 's only 3 .,"99 , not bad , but the same as cici 's so if they 're pizza is not far superior than i will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal .",i know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and i will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement .,i hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children i will do whatever i can to ensure this .,i love my wife so much .,i miss her terribly .,there seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how i have many a time disputed the reality of free will .,how can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally .,because if i had full free will i could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that i would be judged for my actions on earth .,but since i could n't choose whether or not i could be exposed to such information .,i am a catholic .,this is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person .,but the truth is that i consider myself a part of this religion yet i do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion .,for example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me .,my idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this : good people go to heaven .,bad people go to hell .,simple right ?,except what i qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good .,so what now ?,is my idea of good right or is theirs .,"but wait , the plot thickens .",i have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem .,you see i believe that god instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good .,the most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something i find to be unacceptable i can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable .,i am almost always right in this aspect .,every time i have seen something i think is wrong i can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong .,"however , they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions .",the hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions .,i am not proud of all that i 've done in my life .,the only reason i can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because i apply this theory to myself and find it to be true .,i once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends .,one of the worst days of my life .,there is no reason i can use to explain my actions .,but i did it to end the relationship .,"yeah , i know what you 're thinking .",good job huh ?,well she did n't want to leave anyway .,at least that was what i thought .,i was so damn confused .,"i cheated on her , a rule i set for myself a long time ago was that i would never cheat on a girlfriend .",and i did .,i disgraced myself and i hate .,er hated myself for it .,i did it to invoke another of my rules for myself .,should an infraction upon the rule about never cheating on my girlfriend i must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that .,i do n't know if i 'm wrong .,but i could be .,man you know sometimes music can just totally change one 's mood .,now i 'm listening to damien rice .,the little known writer of some of the best music i 've ever heard .,i think he 's great .,it 's kind of weird i guess for a guy to like some other guy 's music so much but i do .,i also like this guy joseph arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me .,their style of singing their lyrics are all so real .,i love the way i can relate to it .,i recently read `` a streetcar named desire '' .,the female role of blanche .,she is like my ex .,"she lies , decieves in the name of giving people what they `` want '' never tell me what i want .",only i know that and i do n't appreciate being told .,if anyone ever makes assumptions about who i am before i meet them .,i get reasonably angry but i hide it pretty ok. you .,for some reason i have been descrimanated against for being mexican twice in my life .,both times by a girlfriends family .,i have an extraordinarily pale complexion .,the funny thing about that is one of them is mexican .,heh what can i say ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"i think about my mother , my ex-boyfriend in houston ( of whom i 'm still in love with ) and just things that are going on in my life right now .",all of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming .,and for some reason during all of this i listen to the most depressing tori amos or sarah mclachlan song .,"after a good cry i always feel better , i think it 's healthy to cry though .",i think it 's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy .,"dealing with things , for me , is the best way to get over them .",but sometimes i tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out .,i seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when i would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me .,"my parents got divorced at that time , about when i was 11 years old or so .",i remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because i missed her .,she and i have one of the best relationships i 've ever seen between parent and child .,she is my friend not just my mother .,"but i do n't cross boundaries , i respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance .","i think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit , use it to their advantage , i just respect it and cherish it with all my heart .","i quote sarah mclachlan , `` and i have the sense , to recognize , that i do n't know how to let you go. `` i think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year .",we 've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other 's lives at some point or another .,"i guess it 's a good thing , he 's a wonderful person and a great person for me .","but i just do n't know if i can do this ( be in love with him have a relationship , what have you ) with him being in houston and me here in austin .","i do n't know if i want him calling me telling me how much he misses me , and telling me he loves me when he 's two hours away .","i guess it 's not that much of a distance compared to other people 's long distance relationships , but i think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those .",i certainly know they 're not for me .,"and from his past experiences with them , all bad , i know he 's not too keen on the idea either .","i miss him terribly , touching him , smelling him , his humor , his voice , everything .",e-mail and phone conversations do n't suffice .,i just got a new laptop and i wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and i hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing .,ugh !,"i hate this thing , but i really do n't i like having it to take to the library .",i just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do .,i 'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things .,they just do n't interest me that much .,i 'm much more of a trial and error person .,except when it comes to math basically because i do n't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out .,i want a formula there for in my face .,we 're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now .,it 's a total bitch .,i made three really cool friends in that class .,one of my friends tim i saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together .,"i wish he were cuter , he 's a really nice guy .",and i made these two other friends tracie ( same name as my best friend ) and stephanie .,"they 're both really cute , and tracie seems like she 'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with .",she was telling me about her cousin 's friend who 's gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion .,imagine that .,but i would love to go to new york .,"especially after seeing that movie a perfect murder , i mean i know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on central park but i would love to just go visit it .","i love the whole image of it , it 's just very chic for some reason .","i would live there if i could get a very high paying position somewhere , but that 's the only way i would .",it 's just too crowded otherwise .,

i have just returned to my room from my biology class .,madeline forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so i can not study them at the moment .,i am very excited because i got a full meal for only $ 3 .,00 !,"i got a free coke , a free corner of a sandwich , 2 free candy bars and i bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks , which by the way was really tasty .",it is in my refrigerator now because i have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago .,well tomorrow at 3:30 i will be done with classes for the week and i am thinking of driving home for the night to lake jackson .,"it is a three hour drive , but i am not really homesick , just feel kind of lost .",the reason i 'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer .,see the one i have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three dell representatives'technical experts the battery will not charge .,"so they have sent me a entire system replacement , after first trying to merely replace the battery .",which is what should happen because when one orders a $ 2000 system they would hope it would work .,so my next class is in about an hour and a half .,it is biology which is interesting to me for the most part .,"it is my major , but i have been planning on changing it .",i chose it mostly because what i was interested in was medicine and i wanted to go to medical school after college .,"now , i am not quite sure that is what is for me , although it was never a sure thing .",now i was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where i could take more classes of interest to me and also spanish which i recently tested out of 13 hours !,i could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school i decide on .,there are so many decisions to be made .,now that i have finally chosen a college .,i still am wondering about that decision .,"i mean i have always loved texas , my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer .",maybe that is the problem too much ?,"i just sort of feel like i 'm not fitting in , but then again is n't that what ut is about , being an individual ?","well , i definitely like to be an individual and my own self , but i would like some friends , a group who 'll call and see what i 'm doing , call to hang out .",i mean i have been here only 11 days and i 'm worried ?,"well not yet , i am still giving it time .",but i just feel so down on myself and anti-social .,the only people i have really hung around are from my hometown .,"not that it 's all bad , i just was so ready to branch out into something new !","so going home just seems like a good answer at the time , i even thought maybe i chose the wrong college , but how can i say that when i 've been here not even two weeks .","at home , making friends was always easy .",i was the center of focus there .,"had everything , here there is so many that i am , well , unnoticed .",that in itself is a change .,but then i think is n't everyone else going through the same thing ?,"then if everyone else is , then why do n't we just get together ?",well i guess the world does not work that way .,"but i have not given up yet , there is still hope .",the first football game is saturday and i know that will reinforce my love for the school .,i loved going to the games when i was n't a student at this school .,maybe i can meet some friends then .,so it is labor day weekend coming up .,"mostly i need to be studying , but that is what school is about .","i think we may float the river , so that will be fun .","i have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight , but i have a study session for bio at 7pm , , hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim , change and make it over to welch .",i just am not sure how to work it all out .,"drive , walk , ride the bus .",i do n't live in a city and things are so different here .,"the town i am from , i did n't even live in the city limits .",hhmmmm .,but i really need to workout .,i am not going to get fat in college .,"i need to lose pounds right now , not gain them .","but food is everywhere , i guess you can see by the free food .",well maybe i can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking .,but the candy bars are n't good .,"ok , before next class i need to read some bio and some psychology , but what i really want to do is lay in my bed , listen to music , watch tv maybe take a nap ?",nope not here in the college world .,"wow , i like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i am extremely tired having recently returned from classes .,"the bus ride was n't as cramped as usual but just as long because of the heat , and because i had nothing to look at or it 'd seem very much like i was staring at someone .","not that it really matters though , but either way , i prefer looking at the 'view .","' anyways , i 'm not much in the writing mood right now .",i 'm so used to just rambling on like in my journal entries only i tend to forget almost that i 'm turning this in .,"well , actually , i have n't forgotten that because i am not getting personal with this .","which reminds me , i have n't written anything in a while .","i mean , anything all together , not just journal entries and such .",did i ever tell you how i started writing in a journal ?,"first , let me note that i call it a journal , not a diary because it sounds much too feminine and prissy .","a silly thought , i know , but that just shows how immature i was when i first started .","that also reflects another aspect of the way my family is , but i wo n't go there .",it 's too complicated and no one will ever be able to figure it out .,"really , my family and i are all about each other .",people who know any or all of us may find that odd especially if they are n't so content with their family or at least at the moment .,"but , like i said , completely different , controversial , complex topic .",i 'll just end up talking myself in circles again .,"but like i was saying , my first journal was from mrs. stevens , my seventh grade english teacher who i used to help sometimes in the mornings when we actually got to school early enough for me to have time to assist her .","i was her teacher aide , which was something that junior honor society students got to do .","it ( the honor society and everything else involved with junior high ) really is petty , among other generally negative things .","well , let me type faster so that i can finish this lame , boring story .","well , at the end of the year , as is customary , we exchanged presents once again .",i of course was broke as usual so i think i ended up giving her some flowers that i got from my aunt 's wedding the weekend before .,"hey , i think i did that with my secret teacher too .",yup .,"anyways , she ( mrs. stevens ) gave me a journal because of the one almost actual conversation that we had ( i was n't very good at being social then , if you ca n't tell ) .","we had talked about writing and i mentioned how i thought that it would be awesome to actually write a book someday , something great that i can sit back and just stare at knowing that i put all those words together , i wrote all of that .","i do n't know , i like to see good effects of hard labor .","you know , the finished product .","i guess that 's why i enjoy writing , drawing , coloring , making things , and putting things together .","oh , and reading too of course .","anyways , back to my story again .","well , i also mentioned how i thought it was neat how one of my friends , vicky walsh , who had just moved to this school from the northeast , had written a sort of book that told you how to draw horses .","the plan was that she would write and draw the pictures and another girl whom she later became better friends with in high school , lindsey day , would type it and get paid for that .","well , mrs. stevens gave me the journal at our last morning together and told me that this could be my start .","in fact , she wrote inside something cliche like , `` just think , one of these days when you write your book , i can say that you used to be my student. `` except , it did n't sound so cliche as that when i read the inscription",she also said how she had always regretted not keeping a journal especially now .,"then , i was just happy that i received a present , a pretty yellow one with stripes on it .","yes , i was a very selfish and greedy person .","needless to say , i did start writing in that journal .","in fact , my journal collection has grown to about four or five maybe .",i 'm really not sure .,i stopped writing for a long time then i started again .,"i 've been too busy and lazy to write lately , which always makes me feel guilty for some reason .",i guess i am really grateful to her for that first journal though .,"i wonder if either of us realizes what kind of a difference that has made for me , especially during the hard times i guess .",time is up now .,i 'll write more later .,bye bye ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

wow i ca n't believe i waited this long to write this paper .,i was in a shock when i found out that this was due tomorrow .,deadlines motivate me more than ever .,i told myself that i was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but i guess getting it done is what is most important .,i just played some starcraft with my roommate .,i used to play this game with all my friends from school before war craft iii came out for the computer .,this game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework .,i 'd have to say this game was the devil .,it made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game .,i told them i would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting .,my parents somehow figured out that i started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out .,this was n't a very good feeling .,"well , anyway , this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago .","somehow , all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time .",this was extremely strange because i did n't tell anybody about this news .,i tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions .,this aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak .,a few friends from houston already know .,"i mean , what 's the big deal .",i do n't understand why gossip can travel so fast .,i guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people 's lives .,i think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others .,i find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be `` what 's up '' .,the basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person 's life .,this type of conversation does n't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong .,figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing .,you never know who 's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person .,i figured my actions did n't speak that loud .,but any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other .,it immediately captures the center of attention .,i think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are .,this is not an easy task .,starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes .,"changes in friendship , responsibility and so on .",college is a good way of determining who your real friends are .,these are truly hard to find .,i knew this girl that had about 3 parties a year .,there would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company .,but one time at lunch i saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too .,it 's crazy how things can turn right around like that .,well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not .,my friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and i think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship .,"we hardly ever talk about serious matters , so this was refreshing to me .",i hang out with a bunch of guys that are n't really open to their feelings .,we seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we 're just buddies .,"i mean we 'll be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking , especially about relationships .",we 'd always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not .,i always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt .,but this was never the case .,three out of the four guys go to school here in austin but the fourth person is in san antonio .,i can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends .,everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but i feel obliged to back him up .,i know it 's all in fun but after a while i think it 's just mean .,i miss the guy too .,i hope he makes it to austin next year .,

"oh boy , the first writing assignment .",i hope i am doing this correctly .,i ca n't really think of anything else right now .,i sort of have a slight headache .,todays speech class was very boring .,i am still bored because of it .,sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored .,what else can i say .,i am still bored because of it .,my mind is still a blank .,i do n't know what i feel .,"my apt is sort of warm right now , so i guess its a little warm in here .",i can hear my computer buzzing above everything else .,i guess that can start to get annoying after a while .,"oh man , its only been two minutes thus far .",20 min of writing sure will suck .,"well , i still do n't know what to think .",i 'm still bored .,i 'm now starting to think about a friend of mine .,"a special friend , who 's company i enjoy very much .","she lives back home in houston , and i occasionally see her on the weekends , although i 've been talking to her online quite a bit lately .",she is definetly someone special .,now i 'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly .,"although this guy is a friend of my roommates , he is also a friend of mine , but through our mutual friend .","he 's always over , always .","this guy can get annoying , and when ever he comes over , he just annoys us .",i 'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now .,now my mind has drifted to ice cream .,we all had ice cream last night .,"it was good stuff , but i think i had a little too much .",we went to cold stone creamary on the drag .,now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer .,its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream .,that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now .,"now my mind has drifted to my dad , who paid for that ice cream when i when i bought it using his credit card account .",i guess i thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home .,"now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago , but i ignored his call because i am doing this writing assignment .","this guy is a cool guy , i like him .",he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio .,his girlfriend goes here to ut .,he 's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate .,now my mind has shifted to a looser guy i know that my friend from san antonio does n't like .,this other guy also goes to school in san antonio .,"these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago , and although i 'm a passivist , i hope my friend and this other guy duke it out , for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons .","i thought it was funny seeing the two argue , and almost fight .","although if the two were to fight , i think my friend would beat his ass .","now thinking of san antonio , my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio .","some of these guys went to high school with me as well , some did n't .",i wonder how they 're doing .,"its been a while since i last talked to almost any of them , and i just wonder how they 're doing .",maybe i should go up there sometime .,although i have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now .,"oh boy , another seven minutes to go .",damn that 's a long time .,i 'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio .,"now i 'm thinking about a friend that went to ut , from san antonio , who unfortunetely flunked out of ut .","i think his parents were n't too happy about it , because i 've heard they 've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by .","now another friend called me , but i ignored his call as well .",now i 'm thinking about my friend who just called me .,"this guy i 've know for almost 18 or 19 years , quite possibly one of my earliest friends .",he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged .,i 'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time .,happy because he 'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling .,yet sad becuase i know things will be different once he 's married .,"for example , he wo n't be able to hang out quite as much , although i 'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then .","and also becuase he 'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably wo n't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer , or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days .","what ever the future holds for him , i know he 'll be happy , and for that reason , i too am happy , for him that is .","well , its about another two minutes to go , i hope that this will end soon .","and now i see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and i , which i do n't thin she should do .",i think i 'll stop her when i 'm done wtih this assignment .,another couple of seconds to go till i 'm done .,yippie ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

today has been the worst and most stressful day ever .,all i want is for something to go right !,i tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it did n't work because again i 've messed something up !,i was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that i thought was gone but realized after i had erased half o of it that it was really still there !,aahhh !,can something please go right ?,my ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we 've all been trying to make it work for four days now .,i do n't even know if i 'm supposed to push enter when i get near the end of the line but i figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go .,i just looked at the clock and i 've only been writing for four minutes .,why does time go by so slowly when it counts .,"speaking of timing , mine is the worst !",i always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me .,"whenever i like a guy i 'm to shy , stupid , scared , immature to let him know , and by the time or if he likes me i have lost interest !",or they never have interest in the first place and i find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead of the one who likes me !,"or in one case i 'll find out that after liking me four two straight years , he decides to change sex preferences when i like him .",ahhh !,"actually i had my chance and now i 'll have to live with regret forever , or until he wants an opposite sex relationship !",ten minutes to go and i 'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life !,i want someone who respects the fact that i 'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive .,"which reminds me as i look above my roommate 's computer of another guy who i let slip through the cracks even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening , i never acted on my feelings , wait a minute i did spill my guts while playing",truth or dare with him and other friends .,"i wish i could play truth or dare with the other guy i like ( d ) so that he 'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ; apart , i liked you then and i liked you up until i found out there was",no chance for us and i resented you a little !,someday i 'll get up the courage to tell him !,it is about twenty degrees fahrenheit in my lovely room in jester east on the tenth floor .,the air conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as i type .,"i have been having stomach problems all day , and they are starting to resurface , i almost passed out at the draw for the football game against rutgers this saturday , i refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes i will .",one minute to go and i 'm starting to feel relieved that i wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again .,five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon i 'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too .,i 'm majoring in psychology but i used to want to be an architect .,"oops , i got carried away and wrote one minute over , now it is two .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.060067 0.298714 0.177 0.322876 -0.086802 -0.806851 0.632265 0.265071 0.303829 -0.192848 -0.057711 -0.112239 0.778898 0.120528 0.606665 0.0 -0.04277 0.335761 0.389221 -0.016816 0.40613 0.01416 0.153313 0.093859 -0.624052 -0.396094 0.462152 1.35427 0.389608 0.803742 1.194533 0.063278 -0.290783 0.903697 -0.402745 -0.292111 -1.04032 -0.602983 -0.241724 -0.615746 0.198355 -0.332141 0.3309 -1.048268 -0.73045 -0.677395 -0.097146 -0.183114 -0.882269 0.042224 0.296001 1.7037 1.122889 -1.24281 -0.315862 -0.012737 -0.070771 -0.954251 0.473721 0.825885 0.428325 0.696417 -0.480161 0.145244 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.428476 -0.187505 -0.073676 0.670392 -0.307677 2.073387 -0.103776 -0.422267 -0.125506 0.539758 0.176945 -0.690287 5.00665 4.006666 4.78907 4.965036 4.595044,187
urg !,there is sand in my sandal .,it 's been there for a while now .,it was so annoying that i had to take my shoes off while i was driving home from my horrendously long art class today .,i had to wait for half an hour for that stupid bus .,it was at least 6:45 by the time i reached my stop .,you 'd think that rush hour would be over by then .,it was n't .,i sat in traffic from enfield all the way out past the y at 290. that is just insane .,i was stuck behind a maroon jeep cherokee with a gore'liberman bumpersticker on it for most of the way .,but that guy exited when i got to the 290'mopac split .,then i was confused as a white rav 4 started diving through lanes into spaces too absurd to drive in .,it was quite odd and annoying all at the same time .,then i was almost cut off by a stupid woman in a red mini-van and her punk looking son .,i 'll just say this : i was ready for this day to end at about 2:00 this afternoon .,now it 's getting cold in here .,my dad 's office is always cold .,"of course , his computer is always on .",it 's a giant that 's hardly ever used .,shame really .,so my feet are starting to get quite chilly .,more of the usual discomfort .,the smell in here is rather interesting .,it smells like candy .,cherry candy to be precise .,for a moment i thought my boyfriend might be eating some of the lollypops my dad always has on his desk .,he was n't though .,odd .,it 's really not that usual for an automotive shop office to be smelling like candy .,there are too many boxes at my feet .,it 's hard to get comfortable with all of them at my feet .,i keep mentioning my feet .,why is that ?,"they 're uncomfortable , that could be one reason .",i feel bad because i have been sort of brusque with my boyfriend .,"here he is , come all the way from across town just to see me and i ca n't even spare him five minutes before i launch into my homework .",i think i 'll give him a hug now .,just a minute .,i think he appreciated that .,it was a necessary break in my stream of consciousness .,"he gives so much of his time to me , the least i can do is give him some back in return .",sometimes i wonder why he is so loyal .,i tend to rush past him when i 'm doing something or i overlook him when he wants my attention .,he really dose n't deserve that .,he 's such a nice person .,i always tell him that i 'm a mean person and that he would be better off with someone prettier and nicer .,he just smiles and hugs me and tells me there is no one better .,"i have my doubts , but i really do n't think i 'd give him up if someone better were to come along .",i 'd fight to the death to keep him .,that 's how much i love him .,i 'm a very jealous person .,i 'm stingy with my boyfriend and i 'm stingy with my friends .,i do n't like anyone being around him ( mostly females ) if i 'm not there too .,"i know i should n't be so difficult , but it 's not really something i have any conscious control over .",i do n't like my sister being around my friends either .,i hate sharing friends with her .,she 's younger than i am and she has her own friends to hang out with .,"i do n't bother her friends , why should she bother mine ?",i 'm beginning to wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over for me to wash it .,i 've been needing to do laundry for a while now .,"there 's charcoal stains all over my shorts , and i 've run out of spiffy t- shirts to wear , so it 's off to the wash. i do n't know whether or not i 'll have time to do it all tomorrow as i had hoped .",i also need to pay a visit to my old high school tomorrow .,i 've promised my friend katy i would visit .,"there 's really only three teachers i want to see : mr. meitz ( physics ) , mrs. hebert ( english , creative writing ) , and mr. dennis ( newspaper ) .",the trinity of great teachers .,and with all great figures there has to be a devil .,"mine is mr. austin , my art teacher for three years .",i looked up to him as a mentor and he turned his back on me at the end of my senior year .,i was crushed .,still i wonder if my boyfriend brought his laundry over .,he 's really not the most hygenic person in the whole world .,i 've had friends tell me that he 's lucky to have me because he 's too disgusting to date other women .,i do n't have a problem with him .,"sure he tends to go three or four days between showering , three or four weeks between laundry cleanings , and three of four months between room organizing , but i love him anyways .","and besides , i 've been know to go a day or two or three between showers .",all this talking about him makes me want to hug him again .,i think i will .,"once again , just a moment .","okay , i 'm done .",i keep hearing the sound of a little red desiel isuzu outside .,"there are no windows in here , so i really ca n't see .",very strange indeed .,my hands are starting to cramp .,my wrists are aching and my fingertips are numb .,it 's a leathal combination of the extremely powerful air conditioner and all this typing .,my hands are starting to look cold too .,when my hands are cold they get a little paler .,even a little yellow .,did i mention that my neck hurts too ?,it does .,"my butt is doing nicely , though .",must be this comfy chair .,my dad bought it at the bombay company for his birthday .,it 's really nice .,sometimes i wonder if i have a brain tumor .,"there are times when i forget simple things , or i get simple things confused .",i really hope i do n't have one .,i 'm planning to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend .,i suppose i should really call him my fiancee .,"yes , that works .","we 're going to be married on february 5 , 2006. it 's going to be marvelous .",we 're going to have platinum puzzle rings made for our wedding bands .,why puzzle rings ?,because we exchanged our own special puzzle rings as marks of our engagements .,i do n't know if i would call it official or not .,we have n't formally announced it to our parents .,mine already know i 'm not leaving him .,i half think my mother wishes i would .,"my dad likes him , though .",that 's always a good sign .,there is a gigantic printer seated on the desk beside me .,it 's a monstrous beast of a machine .,"it 's actually a printer , fax , copier , scanner all in one .","great piece of machinery , really .",i do n't want to do the dishes that are waiting down at the house .,"i had a long day filled with the joys of muenstral cramps , and i 'm really not up to the task .",i hope someone does them before i finish all this .,"i have five younger sisters , three of which are at the dishwashing age .",you 'd think one of them would do them .,"still , i have an ominous feeling that i will be burdened with the chore as i am burdened with so many other things .",sometimes i ca n't stand my family .,"fortunately , my step-mother is no longer part of that life .",i should really be calling her what she now is : my father 's ex-wife .,that fits so much better .,i 'm just glad she 's gone .,life would be much more hectic with her still here .,she 's a bi-polar wrech who refuses to take her pills .,did i mention that she cheated on my father when they were married ?,one more reason for me to despise her .,i despise any person who cheats on their spouse or partner or whatever you want to call the person you are in some way or another bonded to .,"it may not be a happy bond , but theres nothing that excuses cheating in my eyes .",i will never cheat on my fiancee and i hope to god that he never cheats on me .,i would be crushed .,i 've been watching that timer like a hawk since i started .,i 'm so tired of typing that it hurts .,literally .,"but with a minute and a half left , i must press on .",ha !,it 's a pun and i did n't even realize it !,i 'm so clever .,"some would argue that point , but i still think i have my shining moments .",everybody needs their shining moments .,"without shining moments , we 're just dull .","afterall , what 's the opposite of shiny ?",dull .,i never want to be dull .,"i 'm certain that people already find me dull , but as long as i do n't know about it , it 's all good .",i just hope they never say it to my face .,that would make me either sad or mad .,i guess it depends on the weather that day .,but people who know me do n't think i 'm dull .,at least i hope not .,i just do n't like waiting all afternoon for a bus that takes thirty minutes to run .,and you can quote me on that one .,so there .,yep ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

well right now i only have a couple things on my mind that do n't seem to leave my head all day long .,the two big ones are this guy i saw again and had a great time with and my school work .,these two things are really bugging me .,"first off with school i am worried about what type of grades i am going to get , whether or not i am going to keep myself on top of my works , whether or not i will have the will power to actually tell people no i ca n't","do this because i have to study , how are the first test in all my classes going to go , is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that i am going to have to knwo , how much harder are these tests going","to be then my test i had in high school , how exactly do i study for a college test when there is so much information to know , how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions .",these are a lot of the questions that run through my head and i am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life .,"i guess another reason i am so worried is because i would really like to get into the business school if possible , but everyone tells me how hard it is and that i am going to have to make a 4 .",0 and then even then i possible could not get in if i do n't have the right connections or know the right people .,"so on that note , i am starting to try to figure out exactly what am i going to do with my life or major in if i do n't get into the business school .","i guess there are other things that i am interested in , but it would just make life a lot easier if i got in .",the other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend .,"he is such an extremely nice guy , smart , gorgeous , and so much fun to be around and totally sweet .",i have n't been treated like he treated me in a long time .,"he seemed totally into me too , but i do n't know .",i guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as i did about him .,he seemed like it though .,he also just happens to go to texas a & m too .,which makes things even more confusing .,"one , if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing ?","( it 's only an hour and 45 minutes away , but still that 's different than living in the same town 5 minutes away ) also what goes on in my head is would i really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would i really",want to put up with whole long distance thing .,i ca n't stop thinking about him and i think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too .,"he is actually 3 years older than me , so i know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college .",i do n't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways i am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head .,"i just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that i do , but who knows i guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and i are going","to work out , so i should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much .",i guess i can only prepare myself the best i can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy i guess is ment to be ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.177709 -1.118729 0.333654 -1.326022 -1.294697 0.662773 -0.003119 -0.787487 -0.654227 0.144164 0.101349 0.033302 -1.273568 0.564946 -0.440192 0.0 -0.04277 -1.013734 -0.308003 -0.568494 -0.478058 -0.742368 0.233599 -0.631956 -0.624052 0.494336 0.672813 0.258611 -1.329817 -1.156807 -0.765713 -0.450737 -0.658463 1.468281 -0.748911 -0.751938 0.868072 1.161961 0.609193 0.346429 0.043284 0.078961 0.263413 -0.747367 -0.818082 -0.281326 -0.222039 -0.16104 -0.18148 -0.355481 1.287581 -0.613026 -0.555293 0.614977 0.317939 0.499135 0.441463 0.255275 1.569942 0.301697 1.788574 1.269399 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.252629 -0.060514 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.345301 -0.37208 -0.133022 -0.422267 -0.827908 0.415497 0.103524 -1.247819 4.930525 4.270109 4.655618 4.463174 4.059781,855
so i do n't know exactly what im supposed to write about here .,i guess whatever is on my mind at the moment .,my roomate is watching some wierd movie right now and the lady in it is screaming about something going wrong .,and her husband is talking on the phone to another woman .,maybe he 's cheating on her with this other woman .,who knows ?,so it 's 4:22 right now and i do n't want to what

them with dashboard and weezer !,i actually kind of liked their music !,and then cave-in was alrigth too .,i had fun watching the drummer 's ab and arm muscles move around and work as he played bis drums with his shirt off !,it was nice !,why is it that all drummers play with their shirts off ?,i guess they just like to be topless .,and have all the girls stare at them .,or maybe it 's just a sweat thing as baxter says .,who really knows ?,baxter is a cool girl .,im glad that i met her at orientation .,i have soo much fun hanging out with her .,but chris is great !,he is soo funny !,and hes so sweet too !,i hope he gets my email about wanting to be study buddies with him for french class .,that would be a great help !,plus you know i 'd be able to see chris more often .,wahoo !,he is soo adorable .,but really .,i do need the help in french .,thats one of those classes that you really have to work hard at every single day in order to get good at and stay good at .,he seems to be doing pretty well in there .,especially since he took french longer than i did .,maybe a year more .,but who really cares .,he is better at it than i am .,or so i think .,i hope he wants a study buddy too for that class .,because i really want to do better on my next test in there .,"i want to pul my grade up from a b to an a , which i wo n't be able to do unless i get help from someone else .",and chris would be the perfect person to get that help from .,anyway .,im getting tired of typing everyhting that comes into my mind .,but i guess thats exactly what everyones blogs are about .,just them randomly typing waht they are thinking about and sharing it with everyone !,john sur is good at that .,he always has something interesting or intellectual or funny to say in there .,its great !,i am soo glad that we became friends .,he really does seem to make me feel smarter just because he teaches me so much !,especially and my faith .,he really has influenced me and helped me out so much with that .,i do n't know what i would have done without him .,his everlasting questions and curiosity have made me wonder and become more curious myself about my own faith and i thank him for that .,also

best friends this past year and i do n't know how my life would be different without them !,they really do make me feel like a better person for knowing them .,and i thank them from the bottom of my heart for them always being there for me with all of the neverending support !,i miss all of them soo much here at college .,but at least i ahve a few of them here at ut .,john and chris are here

signed up for it .,it truly does help you feel more at home here in school and make ut feel like a smaller campus .,because i really do n't think that it seems like it is as big as everyone says it is

and i remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group .,i talked to catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade .,she broke down one night in montana when we were on mission tour .,we were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings .,she just broke down which was a first .,i talked to her and told her that i hated talking about seth around her because jake and him were the same age .,she said that she loved hearing

traditions .,"like every christmas eve , seth and i open one present , an ornament .",mine are always angels and his are always bears .,eventually we added my mom and dad with cats and santa 's .,my mom does n't even like cats .,when she was little her dad expected her to like the animals and be near them so i think that 's why she does n't like them .,they had a farm .,she hated her dad .,i ca

i just got finished with my spanish homework and now i can think in english .,i do n't really care for spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language .,before that i was writing email to friends of mine at other schools .,it is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them .,if i did n't have email i probably would n't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive .,i just found out that one of my friend 's friend is quitting school .,i do n't understand that .,giving up an education seems ridiculous to me .,gold fishes are also ridiculous .,"my neighbor has oh wait , had two goldfish .",one of them died last night .,gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish .,one minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a pepsi commercial .,i now have been writing for five minutes and i wish i could stop looking at the clock .,i took a computer assisted english class last semester and i am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience .,one of my projects last semester had to do with the tick .,"he is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures , or nightmares , into the inner workings of his mind , he also has antenna which are referred to as those `` things '' on the cartoon by his cohorts .","my little sister likes the tick as well but i do n't think she understands alot the humor in it , most of its pretty stupid i will admit .",my sister just learned how to say her abc 's in spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone .,the way she says `` w '' is really cute .,"my brother just got married this past summer and i do n't know what to think of his wife , she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange .",but i am not really a judge of strange since i have been called that myself a time or two .,"actually i think everyone is called strange , or weird , at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing .","like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend , when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card , or package of candy .",ten minutes .,it is amazing how often people look at the clock .,"my batteries went dead awhile back and i do n't really miss it very much , granted i took my sister 's mickey mouse watch every now and then , in fact i think it is my room right now , but time often feels insistent and that can be",stressful .,kind of like how i have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment .,my calf muscles are incredibly sore and i have been complaining about them all day .,my roommate said that i should n't complain because i was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday .,"well i was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much , if i had know that this was how i was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice .",15 minutes .,the mtv movie awards are on tonight and i do n't know if i really want to watch them or not .,"its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are , i get enough of that with going to school here , just kidding .",i will probably watch it anyway .,"my neighbors are pretty cool , even the one with minus on fish .","i sure hope it did n't die because she did n't feed it , or over fed it .","i do n't see the purpose of a goldfish , i like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish , even though that is disgusting .","i just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla , but now it is bob .",what ever happened to quesadilla i will never know .,i guess my dad and mom just could n't hang with a name that made no sense .,"well it made sense to me , because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant , and they have the best quesadillas there .",20 minutes ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i just clicked the go button for this writing assignment for psychology and i just almost misspelled psychology .,"it is amazing how i ca n't spell psychology and how i still stumble on spelling it on the keyboard , psychology , i just did it again .",at the beginning and before this page there was a precautionary note that said if people were insecure about their confidentiality .,"it is just an assignment , what could possibly go wrong .",the teacher or ta will steal your identity !,if they do they some students should sue .,that is weird .,i ca n't believe i just wrote that .,i am writing this assignment now because i have some spare time and the writing assignment is due on friday .,i do not even know when i would have done this assignment .,"i have free time because my computer science class was , i guess canceled .",i hope it was canceled because i hate missing class .,it feels as if i am missing some knowledge that is necessary for my brain .,i hate when i am unsure if class is actually canceled .,"added to that , i hate when people are still in class sitting in the room waiting for class to start .",those students make me uncomfortable because it seems as if they know ( they do n't ) that we actually have class .,i am in the computer lab typing this writing assignment and i do not know what else to write about .,let 's think .,i am thinking .,"okay , i am in the corner , near corner of the computer lab and i am typing .","oh yeah , speaking of writing assignments , my architecture writing assignment is going to be difficult because my ta wants us or prefers that we use chicago style in our papers .",when he asked us if anyone did not know how to use chicago everyone was quiet and a huge pregnant pause was present .,"it is weird that teachers still do not understand that if students are quiet when they ask a question , nobody knows the answer .",it is weird .,i am now thinking if i am even doing this assignment correctly .,it seems as if i am `` tracking my thoughts '' of this past week .,i hope i still get credit for this class .,i do n't even know this class is hard or easy yet .,maybe i should reply that girl who mass emailed everyone and say that we should start a study group .,a study group would hopefully help me learn more about this subject .,i hope i can pass this class because as much as it is interesting i do n't

.",this is sort of getting tiring .,i wonder how psychologists interpret this writings .,i ca n't wait to read what the explanation for this writing assignment is .,i think it would be cool if one of our tests was just writing this kind of stuff .,`` write what is on you mind for 20 minutes '' .,that would be weird .,"it would be a completion test grade , which would be cool .","i think i have 4 more minutes , and it is weird that i said 'think ' because i can not subtract and i am a math major .",well my calculus professor said that he has problems with simple arithmetic also so i am not that worried .,it always reassures me that teachers'professors have the ability to forgot simple things like that .,it makes myself better .,i ca n't wait for this timer to be over .,i am waiting and i am just typing stuff down .,i have 2 minutes left so when i am done with this minute i will have 60 seconds left .,"so , yeah .",time is dwindling down .,i wonder how many people are doing this assignment right as i am doing this assignment .,what will i do after this .,oh yeah i have to read for my next class .,wait !,i have to read for this class .,"i ca n't believe i for got , i need to

"well here i am sitting at the computer typing very badly as always , constantly hitting the backspace key .",i just rebought my books from varsity books online becuase some of or rather one of the books i have is signifigantly cheaper there and then i registered for some sweepstakes tat they have- like i could ever win one of those things but you never know in eighth grade,at the going away dance only for eighth graders i won a bag of blowpops huge bag and i never ate most of them they sat in my desk drawer for a long time and then as a periodically clean my desk drawer i would find one and throw it,away .,my roomate is on her computer too typing awaay talking to her boyfriend she is so dedicated she already finished all her homework already i 'm still just kind of trudging along .,i 'm really tired its time to go to bed i wonder if i should take advil because i had my wisdom teeth out on friday but i 'm really tolerant to pain so i never even took the perscription pain medication- but i have no idea if anything is,wrong because i just sort of ignore the pain .,after i finish this i am going to take a shower we talked with our suite mates about the bathroom and stuff my roomate is talking to me about having a place to stay for her boyfriend over labor day she does n't know who of her friends will be,here so he might stay in our dorm but i know that they wo n't do anything i 'm probably going home because i live here in austin then he can stay in my bed if he wants it wo n't bother me he 's a nice guy- i have,only known jenny for 5 days and it seems so much longer we really get along pretty well we come from similar backgrounds too .,we both grew up in the us with parents from taiwan so we have similar backgrounds .,i filled out that survey it was so strange and so long .,the pre-test thing .,i 'm just an all over goody goody so it was interesting to think of people filling it out diffeently with their true lives i 'm such an innocent and i do n't see people doing bad things liek drinking or having sex and abortions .,one of our suite mates rushed and she got into zta and some of her sorority sisters are taking her out tonight and i asked where she was going and she said to some frat parties and she was going to come back completely hammered it made me wonder because,it 's the first day of school and she has an 8:30 class tommorow but oh well it 's not might life or my concern .,this room is so cold .,and she seems so smart to she took all the ap classes and i think she was on drill team too .,and she has a bum of a boyfriend or something like that it seems like everyone has a boyfriend but me but thats ok i do n't need a guy to make me happy even though i would like a boyfriend- i 've never had one before that is so,strange but that 's ok. i saw a lot of people from high school so far well not a whole lot but that 's ok. there are a few of us from church here also clement who is in this class too was supposed to come help me update my,differentials on norton or something- my brother like icqed me and told me to do it at least once a week i had no ide what he was talking about and i tried to do it .,i ca n't believe i have so much to do already i have a lot of classes i thought it would kind of be like high school but i do n't think so i saw a few people around campus that i know from church it was really weird thinking,i knew them and stuff and seeing them- you can tell all the freshman on campust because they walk around with maps in there hands and they get to class about 15 minutes early but that wo n't last long- especially those 8 o'clock classes oh i think i need,to charge my cell phone i 'm not sure oh well .,well i think my twenty minutes is up and i 'm about to completely fall asleep and one of my suitemates is in the bathroom so i guess i could read sociology until she is done but .,well good night ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

oops i do n't know what i just did .,"but back to that , i always feel bad for the customers because who wants a server thats all sweaty ?",i would be so thank god alright im not really sure what to do now .,i just typed for a complete 10 mins then the side of my hand hit return .,soooo i guess i 'll type for another 20 mins to make sure i get the credit .,"im not an overachiever either , but i might as well just type .",we 're going to light some candles in our room now .,my roommate just said our room smells like shoes .,mmmmmmmm .,luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh ( er ) .,thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty !,alright i feel a headache coming .,i think because im hungry .,"i ate , what .",maybe 4 or 4 1 ' 2 hours ago ?,aaaaah im hungry !,morning seems so far away .,alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again .,thanks !,yes i am frustrated .,stupid hand !,its because i type fast and do n't pay attention to what im hitting so much .,"i just get sooo into this , haha .",hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine .,oh well mine looks prettier .,ok i need a date book .,i just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go .,i want one of our good friends from chicago to come in hte weekend of the a & m game .,that would be fun for him .,but problem .,i think thats the day after thanksgiving .,the morning after actually .,shit .,"my friend jess will be in chicago until saturday , and i know im going to lubbock .",but i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all .,but what to do .,because austin honesctly doesnt compare to chicago .,so i need something fun for him to do while hes here .,i mean besides 6th street because he is a club freak .,"but its great , because hes so much fun to go out with !","and even better , he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above .",so essentially he can get us in with no problem ( not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls ) because all the fun ones are 21 and over .,shhh do n't tell my mom i told her i stopped going to them !,she found out once because of jessicas crazy parents .,oooh i ca n't stand that .,but we still continued and had a jolly time .,everyone there knows us and that we 're underage .,its great .,"really the chicago cops , the whole town is nuts .","everyone thinks texas is laid back , which it is , but really the chicago cops really just do n't give a shit .","there are so many undercover cops at the doors who know us , and even ones who work outside just patrolling the streets .",but they look for more trouble than just underage drinkers .,kind of funny .,one night about 8 cops were leaving this really big club downtown chicago and stopped us on our way out and started asking questions .,like hold we were and blah blah .,"but they were all drunk and laughing , and traveling around in a paddy wagon !","we said we were 19 , we 're 18 i do n't know why we said that .",and they asked for our numbers and offered to take us out with them .,but thats just how all of them are .,its sooo weird .,"but unless you know people its not so easy being underage , chicagos not a big underage drinkers fest .",which i really do think the law is ridiculous .,"if the drinking age were persay 18 , then i do n't think there would be such a huge binge drinking problem for kids when they leave to college .",because if kids are allowed to drink with parents supervision ( which in il its illegal ) then the parents can monitor it and teach their kids .,that way leaving for college isnt such a huge shock and kids wo n't get buck wild because they can drink without parents grounding them .,most of my friends parents were real laid back about that issue .,all of our parents but one was kind of anal .,but im glad i went out a lot in highschool and learned how the manage liquor because now i have no desire to try to get wasted and stupid like the rest of the freshman i see around here falling over themselves .,its really not that bad though .,there are just a few dumb ones who arent used to it .,i would honestly rather stay in my room during the week and keep up with my classes than drink a beer and get fat for no reason !,ok 6 more minutes of reading my typing .,"im sorry for whoever does read this , hope youre not getting too bored .","i really do enjoy psychology though , it interests me .",i just wish i could have switched into an earlier class because i get out so late every day of the week but fridays !,i took a psychology course my senior year .,it was really easy .,"we had a new teacher so she didnt know much what she was doing , but we still learned .","i really wish i took the ap psychology because they were honestly pretty much always at the same page as us and i heard it really wasnt that hard at all , which i thought the regular psychology was just too easy .",at least i could have earned some credit from the ap test .,whoa listening to the fast typing sounds so weird .,all of a sudden it just goes rapid fire and real fast !,i feel like such a nerd .,im about to go crazy typing for the past 20 minutes straight .,ok someone keeps making noise out there whats going on .,i have other work i could be doing right now !,at least this doesnt have to be edited .,that would be awful because i never do the right punctuation when it 's not a formal paper .,even letters to friends im so lazy .,lazy americans .,30 more seconds !,this went by pretty quick though i guess .,i still want to eat .,"i hope i can just fall asleep soon , what movie do i feel like watching ?",im stuck .,ok im done now !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i do n't like the fact that i 'm not sure if i can print stuff in this library .,"it would be so much more easy if i had my own computer , but oh well sarah is probably getting one in a few days then i can use hers it is so crazy how much things have become computer dependent i never thought that i would have a",class that was web-based .,"but it seems that most of mine are and its kinda good in a way because it is forcing me to actually use the technology thats out there i 'm not very computer oriented but i think about one year of college will whip me into shape , speaking of","i need to go to the gym , but i 'm not sure that ill make it tonight maybe ill call jane and see if she has time to go wiht me .",sarah does n't really work out a lot so i 've been doing it by myself it would be a good idea to get one of thoes little hand held recorders and tape my spanish lectures because he lectures entirely in spanish and i understand spanish stuff so much better,the second time through that i think it would be a really good idea to tape him and then listen to it while i work out wow its only been five minutes its hard to do stuff like this when you know that tons of homework awaits you and you,arent really looking forward to it .,i 'm so glad we have monday off a & m does n't ' even have this holiday but i guess that they started later than we did .,i 'm going there this weekend and i ca n't wait to see my closest friends in all the world because they all went there i 'm glad i didnt even though i miss them dearly because i have been forced to meet all kinds of new people and i,"have met some really nice ones , not as great as my best freinds but then again its only been two weeks they all seem to be sticking together pretty much which i think i s pretty dumb because they are never going to grow up if they do n't",start spreading there wings so to speak .,its kinda funny that i just happened to look at my watch and i have been writing for ten minutes now i always seem to look at it in 5-10-15 minute increments .,maybe myu internal clock is really acurate or something .,i dunno .,i 'm really tired right now even though i got a lot of sleep the other night maybe i just need even more .,i need more sleep thatn anyone i know i wonder if i get more tired because i convince myself i didnt get enough sleep or if i 'm actually really tired .,"i think i do get really tired becuase it starts to show on my face , i get horrible bags under my eyes and i just look gross .",like right now .,"plus i am totally broken out , more than i have ever been , but i 'm hoping that its just the stress from going off to colegio .",who knows well see in about a week .,why is it that sometimes your face turns red .,i hate that so much i feel so exposed when that happens .,i can feel it getting hotter and i think that makes me even more self concious which in turn makes mya face even more red .,i wonder if people you do n't know notice when you blush or is it not as obvious as it seems .,i didnt used to blush but now i occasionally do a t really inopportune times .,like today when a guy i think is attractive said hi to me i got all flustered .,its so stupid i do n't even know him and i 've convinced myself that we are destined to be together .,sometimes i am so unrealistic when it comes to relationships correction i am always unrealistic that is something hard for me to admit to because in admitting that i feel let down .,"i get really dejected when it comes to guys , and i do n't theink that any good ones exist even though i know in theory that is n't true i just havent come accross anyone who has disproved it to me .",maybe its because i do n't attract the nice guys because i 'm sending off a negative vibe that was on oprah the other day .,they were saying how can you attract someone if you automatically have a bad attitude about it and think that they couldnt possibly be worhty of you .,i dunno .,i ca n't stop thinking all guys are bad just to attract a guy because i think that is the wrong motive for changing my opinion .,its like in bridget jones diary she does stuff like that sometimes i remind myself of her except not as extreme .,well of course not she was a complete lunatic .,i wish my parents were not in ireland right now becasue i would looooovvvveeee to see them this weekend but i can wait i miss them so much i think because we get along so incredibly well its really abnormal i think no one else i know gets along as,well with there parents as i do its really cool i thinkwow i went over the 20 minutes who would have guessed thats kinda weird everytime i mentioned the time i said wow ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

, and the unique culture .","walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though , but i 'll never walk by myself anyway so it 's all good .",and i love the music scene .,i 'm afraid i 'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown .,i 'm obsessed with spongebob !,"i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room , and i have spongebob band-aids .",he 's so cute !,"and the show is hilarious , totally my type of humor .","i have the dvd as well

so this is my first writing assignent for college .,"i keep forgetting that i am actually in school , and not on vacation of some sort .","i just got out of bad and am havign a lot of feelings right now , all about non-important things , like boys .","i am mad i lost my earing last night , mad that i still have feelings for my ex-boyfriend in a way , and mad that i do n't know what to do about people here .",it is just a totally different experience then anything else and i wonder when i will get used to it .,i think i also need to learn how to type better and use punctuation !,ims never need punctuation or capitilization .,or even correct spelling .,"roommate is still gone , staying with her boyfriend , and its ok because i like him better now .","before i thought he was boring adn not as nice as david , but he is quite goofy and is always nice to em , though soemtimes i get the feeling its because he feels that i am a dork who just goes wherever jerry goes .","people kept telling us that rooming together would be a problem , but so far we have only had issues once , right before school started when we were spending way too much time together , and that was not good .","that one night she left to stay at steven 's and walked out saying , have fun , made me want to punch her , because obviously i was just going ot be hanging out in the room , alone .","now that i am meeting people on my own out of the group , its much easier to do things and feel like i have a life .","i still need to meet more people in my hall , and in classes , but most of them are so big that just being there i feel like not really participating .","going to the lake on labor day was quite an adventure , and one i am glad i had without jerry .",and jumping off the cliff was one of the coolest things i have done in a while .,it also made me glad that no other girls went off the 50 foot cliff .,"i like doing things that girls normally do n't do in these group situations , like the firebreathing and the shotgunning a beer .","but having done it once , i do n't need to do that again .","but i stil almost beat that guy when we did it , hehe .","i do n't understand why people drink beer- it tastes horrible and i have heard that after about 2 , you do n't taste it anymore .",but that means you have to drink 2 of them and then you must be getting pretty mindless to keep drinking somthing you do n't like in the first place .,"then it seems more like somthing people do to be cool , or whatever else people think they need to do .",i have seen less of that in college .,"people seem more laid back in general about all sorts of things , but then again , there are still sorority girl types out there .","i ca n't get over my dislike of the idea of sororities , probably because i do n't know many girls well who are in them .","i have been mostly meeting the guys in steven 's fraternity , and they are all nice , and not all mindless drinkers ( mostly c. s. majors or engineers ) and i am gald that i got to meet them all .",but they are all older then me .,"i used to love to tell people how young i actually was because they were always shocked , saying things like , oh , you do n't look ' act however old i was at the time .","my birthday was just over 2 weeks ago , and that sort of blows my mind because of all the things that have happened so far .",its like every phase of my life is separate from everything else that has happened in my life .,"its hard to even think of middle school anymore , and even freshman year of high school seems like someone elses life .","its also hard to belive that everything with jason just happened last month , that we broke up in august and now its just september , barely , but it still feels like forever since it happened .",oh crap .,the phone just rang and it was some one asking me to go to the co-op with her- yeah !,no more looser-dom !,"but then somehow i hit somthing that made the site go away and now that i 'm back , the timer has started all over again .","well , i think i have about 10 more minutes .","so , all i have accomplished today was sleeping until noon , which has to be my sleep limit , i never used to do that .","and now i guess i will go to the co-op to return a book and hang out with yashoda , and then .","i guess i have to get ready for my date , i guess thats what it is .","i am not looking forward to it anymore after last night , i do n't know were we are going or even if i want to go anymore .","so yesterday jerry was telling me about her comparitive values seminar , and how they had to come to class with somthing to share that they were absolutely certain about , somthing not-ohysical that they could prove .","jerry said that i am me , and that seems certain enough to me .","but another girl said that she is a woman , and they just picked that apart in class because really , how can you be certain of that ?",i think the point of that class is to weird you out and show you that nothing is certain .,"so as if you werent already clueless enough at this point in your life , now you have some class where they tell you nothing is for sure .","besides physical things , what makes me a woman ?",the way i act ?,why do i act the way i do ?,"those questions could go on forever with no answer , but it really made me think about the whole gender thing .",possibly i am a gay man trapped in a woman 's body ?,"oh , the lady in the cafeteria-place today called me sir .","i ca n't believe that happened , she said she couldnt see me around the sign or sneeze guard or whatever was there in front of her but .",she called me sir !,brings back not-good thoughts of jordan thinking it was funny to call me butch and dawn telling me that i am just one of the guys .,"yah , maybe some gender issues here .",i am a woman !,"even if its not totally certain according to all this deep philosophy stuff , i am a woman , and i happen to like boys , and i am pretty sure i do n't resemble a guy ( even with my upper-body buff-ness from swim team ) but it is",still a sore topic for me .,it doesnt help that i am tall .,oh !,another phone call .,"i think my time should be up but the timer is all off , so i will say that this is 20 minutes and that is that !", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder .,everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another .,i keep asking myself whether or not i 'm am going to make it in my major .,my major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major .,"my friends say they do n't know what i got myself into , but i keep telling them i 'll be fine to not worry about me .",when i say this i am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that i will be fine .,this library is all to silent i think i just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing .,while i 'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not i am going to make an a on the chemistry exam on tuesday .,i feel bombarded with chem and i do n't know if i am going to be able to remember all three chapters .,my mind keeps telling me that i will be fine that i just have to get used to it .,high school was so much different than college in that you had to much time you did n't know what to do with it .,that hasnt been my problem lately the only problems i have had all are about having not enough time .,"every time i talk to my girlfriend back home , a senior in high school , i tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy .",i know older people had told me the same but i really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating .,oh yeah i am getting off topic but this library is just boring me .,i feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything .,i feel like they all grasp the ideas that i do n't .,in high school i was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me .,maybe that 's just me overthinking .,i can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library .,it smells like a piece of chocolate .,maybe it is a candybar of some sort .,i do n't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me .,i am not a real big fan chocolate but i do love chocolate ice cream .,something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure .,lately i have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend .,i miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away .,she is graduating a semester early from hs and is going to move to austin and attend acc for the remainder of the year .,i offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents .,i hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass .,her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name .,the man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing .,"he now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal , not spaghetti out of the jar , for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day .",all she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things .,she is one of the most ungrateful people i have ever encountered in my whole entire life .,people who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but i see the real her everyday ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,-0.722524 0.028185 -0.942553 -0.489603 -0.486645 0.384809 0.351774 0.212081 0.596815 -0.030022 -0.09299 -0.590446 -0.036624 1.051031 0.341558 0.0 -0.04277 0.324099 -0.28287 -0.795527 -0.512679 -0.270677 1.361047 1.519132 2.110169 0.531306 1.308401 0.101176 -1.518726 -1.199366 -0.027153 -0.382835 -0.887405 -0.482896 -0.442586 -0.727179 -1.018022 -0.951803 -0.692502 -0.611808 -1.038726 0.664368 0.922633 1.285858 -0.775722 1.694246 0.459546 1.271091 1.025232 0.98935 -0.066496 -0.32592 -0.23768 -0.299984 -0.189704 0.427912 1.716388 -0.307592 -0.707027 0.066215 0.496448 0.240862 -0.480161 -0.328811 0.281477 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.48808 -0.997629 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.769232 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.322328 4.741051 4.032714 4.308479 4.91704 4.632003,2385
stream of consciousness that term reminds me so much of virginia woolf and my long semester studying her and mrs. dalloway .,i ca n't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how mrs. dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad .,i feel so bad for her .,i wonder how fast twenty minutes really is i bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but i guess it is kind of interesting i just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing .,i am so glad that it is labor day weekend and i am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and i guess some studying too although that wo n't be too fun so that will actually take away from,some of the fun goal .,it is so interesting how i am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and i some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely,and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that i can concentrate on just about anything .,i hope this year goes well because i think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year i if the semester goes well .,"i 'm getting kind of sad now that because i am leaving town tomorrow i am going to miss the first football which will be my first texas football game and i have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun , but at least there are",plenty of other games that i can attend .,my hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering i have n't even typed for 10 minutes .,i wonder if i am missing out on anything while i am sitting her typing this but i guess it is n't that big of a deal i do n't think there are many people her anyway and i do n't know where anyone is .,i was thinking about how when i graduated from high school that i would be balling my eyes out but i did n't cry then i thought i would cry when my parents left me here all alone .,but the weird thing is i have n't cried or anything yet i have n't even gotten homesick .,i mean let 's face it is n't like i would have anything spectacular to do even if i was home so i guess that helps in the homesickness department .,"it is so cold in my room i am absolutely freezing and there is no way in which to control the air , i need gloves and winter boots .","i really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings i mean i know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat , but",then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like i am surprised i have n't gotten frost bite from these frigid places .,well the time has actually gone faster than i expected it to it has n't been all that bad once i got over the whole virginia woolf suicide and her book that i had to suffer through and analyze .,it has actually been kind of fun i mean all i have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how i am feeling and that is n't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you,write because personally i do n't ' want everyone in the world to know how i feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part .,i am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best .,that is real comfort food .,wow i am beginning to feel hungry now but i do n't know for what also i really need these twenty minutes to over so that i can run and go get a drink i am really thirsty .,oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer .,but hey i do n't have to type for too much longer ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time .,the title of the movie is event horizon in which a ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through a dimension warp .,my brain feels completely clouded over because i do n't really want to start school .,i also want to bet on football pretty badly .,this past weekend i lost a pretty nice piece of change while none of my teams covered the spread .,"i hope to do much better this weekend , but it has me worried .",my toe also seems to be giving me trouble because it got infected about one year ago but it never seems to get all the way healed .,maybe there is a chance that it will give me problems for the rest of my life .,i 'm pretty tired right now since it is 1:15 in the morning .,i feel i have had a productive day though because i went to class today and got meaningful information from them .,especially in this class .,i usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting .,i liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life .,"it has also just hit me that mr. pennebaker said he was from midland , which is also my hometown .","i think its a pretty good place , you just have to have a little imagination that 's all .",i 'm thinking that since i ran so much this evening my back might actually be sore because of it .,"hell , i do n't know though .","i could use a nice woman in my life right now , but i am extremely picky unless i 've been boozing it a little .",it is cold somewhat in my room right now and there are many things that i must take of before tomorrow .,i need to do some laundry and do some reading for class .,i get extremely irritated when things do n't operate smoothly .,i wish i knew more about computers so that i could take care of my email problem .,a nice cheeseburger would be excellent right now but i do n't really want one do to the fact that i 'm trying to lose a few lbs .,i 'm debating whether or not to turn the tv on and watch a movie or just go straight to bed .,last night i almost got in a fight with one of my pledge brothers and to tell you the truth .,i think the guy knows i could have killed him because he is not crazy enough to take me .,i 'm really not in a position do some work for a good cause .,i need a damn job so i can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with my parents .,one thing i 've noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs .,i mean i 've sat down and talked bad about probably everyone i know .,people pick out one person 's weakness or what they consider to be a weakness and bash them pretty good when they are n't around .,i know people say stuff about me when my back is turned but hey so did i. i figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies .,that is bullshit .,i 've been writing now for 22 minutes i 'll stop ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.42664 -0.199132 -0.475764 -0.218507 0.269503 -0.919001 0.722324 -1.8e-05 0.189354 -0.291301 -0.129955 -0.590446 0.705175 0.289788 0.570816 0.0 -0.04277 -0.546553 -0.030444 -0.795527 -0.24635 -0.215977 -0.564674 0.178379 -0.624052 0.597479 -0.226983 0.228817 1.421259 0.955998 -0.301885 -0.651161 1.046937 0.038375 0.266235 -0.2564 0.424596 0.614187 -0.311835 0.186612 -0.393157 1.066782 -0.397905 -0.402213 -0.335085 -0.03754 -0.053608 -0.527391 0.622798 -0.701817 0.367796 0.24765 0.91444 -0.125943 0.226347 -0.771067 -0.899392 0.489049 -0.568524 0.32667 -0.456888 0.454355 0.541129 -0.745201 0.377534 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.267803 -0.955075 0.091842 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.093581 -0.422267 -0.462072 -0.451544 1.119507 -0.806944 4.453521 4.043471 4.293409 4.358828 4.773027,29
stream of consciousness ?,how do you start something so vague .,"i keep a journal which i write in occasionally , but i can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts. `` i 'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness , because that is definitely",what i am feeling right now .,it 's late monday night and i am taking this time to break up the reading that i have fallen behind in .,"while i am technically still studying psychology , it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text .",what is the point of this assignment anyway ?,how could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind ?,i guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject .,the human mind .,there really is no other single entity ( besides the female mind ) which is so complex and irregular .,"humans are an interesting study , which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology , sociology and history .","but psychology really is the king of the social sciences , it 's all but required for a college student .","i could n't believe how stereotypical i felt when i uttered the phrase `` my psych class '' , it 's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet .","now that i mentioned the greek societies on our campus , i 'd like to delve into that a little .","after overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of kinsolving today , ( they travel in packs ) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that sororities and fraternities actually limit social interaction .","sure it 's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick , but i honestly do n't feel compelled to join a fraternity .","free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season , but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality .","fraternity issues become the mindset of the member , and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person , be they in the same frat or not , is almost always taken advantage of .","yes , some fraternities do some good community work , but it limits people into one train of thought , their loyalty is admirable to the members , but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded .","of course , coming from a freshman non-frat male , that sounds like every other person with an opinion , ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality .","i really do n't oppose the fraternity'sorority concept , because it is a need some people truly need filled .","but the sight of another party where 70 % of the attendance is male , 20 % are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people , and the other 10 % are passed out , it makes them all seem the same .","i feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody , but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the kappa party or the pi phi foam bash , but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked",out of those parties .,"i feel definitely stereotypical again , from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties , could i possibly be the more prototypical male ?","well , here 's the sinker , it 's time to discuss sports .","i cover them for a newspaper , but honestly i 'm just like another fan , but willing to put in the work .","too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio , it 's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space .","any fan with a computer can put together that the cowboys are in a rebuilding year , but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices , meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story .",i guess i am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take ' about the latest controversy regarding sports .,"that 's not to say that all of them are garbage , but too many of them i find repetitive and dull , and bringing nothing new to the argument .","covering a sport is different than giving an opinion , and i enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air .","i love the hunt , and that not only makes me strange , but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer .","of course , as a college freshman , i really do n't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling , but i figure the experience could n't hurt .","much like my decision to take this psychology class , it may seem stereotypical , but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others .","my time is up , i am sorry to whoever is reading this , it must seem very much like the others i 'm sure , but i look forward to this class and i thank you for this very interesting assignment .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"for some odd reason , i felt really cold all day long .","whether i was in my room or just walking around campus , my insides felt really cold and hollow .",maybe it is due to the fact that i had to come back today .,all weekend long i was at home in round rock .,the thought of having to come back really annoyed and made me nervous for no particular reason .,"sometimes i get in this really dark mood and i imagine myself attending all these funerals , and all i can see is black and empty space .","i wonder why i feel this way sometimes , but i always come out of this zone and can not even remember what triggered me to have these images or feelings .","whenever i get this way , all i see is the vision of someone dying or screaming in pain from something so horrible that can not be explained .","once , i had this dream and i witnessed what seemed like the end of the earth ; i came face to face with celebrities that only i dreamed of meeting , and when someone would die , their name and accomplishments in life would be announced on an intercom",you see everyone was captured in this underground tunnel type of cave and we were all waiting for the tide to come in and take us away .,"as soon as i heard my name , birth date , and my few accomplishments in life , i could taste the saltwater in my mouth and that is when i woke up crying and all wet from sweat .","i was really scared and curious to why i had such a dream , but i could never really comprehend what really happened , nor could my friends .","some of my friends gave me back some interesting feedback , but the majority of them thought i was definitely insane .","but after that weird experience , i have not had another experience like that one .",the cool thing is that one of my good friends was doing an interview the next day on weird things that people experience and she interviewed me .,"my quote `` i witnessed the end of the world '' , was in the school paper .","some of her friends on the staff wanted to talk to me about my dream , but i figured since they heard everything i had to say in the paper , there was no reason for me to elaborate any further .","another weird encounter i have had with near death was that in my dream , i was at my mother 's funeral .",the weird thing was that her death was due to cancer .,well that seemed kind of odd because there was never any talk about my mother ever being sick .,"well in my dream , i felt so alone and cried out to her and became hysterical .",i could n't help myself .,"when i woke up from the dream , i was crying and i was covered all over with sweat .",those two dreams are the only serious ones i 've come upon .,"but i wonder why i have such dreams ; could it be a result of my odd days when i feel dark and hollow , or is it caused by some stress factor experienced during the day sometime .",i have heard that people have weird dreams when they ca n't sort out all their problems during the day .,i am really interested in why people have odd dreams and would like to further study the factors as well as reasons that cause these events .,"whenever i have a dream , i hate the fact how i can never remember the following day , even though it 's what wakes me up .","why is it that one can have a dream and after he awakens , he can no longer remember what or who was in it .","i would really like to study the causes of our dreams and the reasons why we become so disturbed , yet can remember nothing .",it would be interesting if someone did an experiment on students as a project ; to detect and understand maybe the basis for having dreams ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,1,0.938553 -0.118533 -1.635138 -0.085451 -0.227317 -1.411352 1.582296 1.511336 0.715092 0.026778 -0.038892 -0.590446 -0.360683 1.109183 0.514745 0.0 -0.04277 -0.554552 -0.128105 0.154064 -0.093672 -0.511733 -0.379974 0.939491 -0.624052 0.447765 0.439898 -0.401517 -0.476364 -1.811488 -1.100231 -1.089257 1.141743 0.749111 -0.455297 0.759197 1.096934 2.826108 0.603338 -0.402729 -0.473021 0.839075 2.317398 0.861977 0.488573 0.040043 1.032727 -0.16302 0.534745 -0.204305 -0.595666 0.028634 2.380105 -1.642178 -0.856248 -0.119332 0.290341 -0.954251 1.174355 0.349167 -1.290148 -1.000025 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.788031 0.501403 -0.073676 2.248046 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 0.271511 -1.23206 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.853389 4.224923 4.543573 4.715082 4.579375 4.880664,269

too natural .,i am not a computer person either .,i guess it could be worse and i could be an extremely slow typer as well .,phew .,"you know , this is n't so bad .",it 's kind of fun .,this

right now i feel somewhat tired and weak because of work last night .,i 'm also feeling a little upset because the eagles destroyed the cowboys 4114 to .,"and to top it off we lost joey galloway , our best receiver .",also troy aikman had another concussion and who knows what will happen next .,but on a more serious note i 'm a little worried about college .,"i guess i feel like i have a lot of weight on my shoulders , because i want to prove to my family and to myself that i can make it .","school has always come pretty easy to me , but this is college and it worries me .",i think once i get the first test out of the way i will be fine .,at least i hope i will be fine !,i 'm also having mixed feelings because i quit my job in order to have ample time for college .,things just were n't mixing right so i had i discussed it with my family we decided it was best for me to hold out on working until i got in the grind of college .,life has been pretty good lately it 's hard to get a schedule with so many things going on .,each day is a whole new adventure .,some troubles i ran into with college so far were finding a parking place and having to walk ten minutes to my classes .,one good thing that has happened though is i have really good classes and professors .,i also have people looking out for me and i have made some new friends .,"ut is like a whole new country there are so many people , places , and things to do .",i 'm beginning to understand college life .,when i first applied to ut i had no idea that it would be like this .,i never expected it to be so big and beautiful .,everywhere you walk there is something new to see .,every building is huge and has something that sets it apart from the others .,i guess ut is blown out of proportion with me because i come from a small town of 5000 people .,it was a city where the most popular people won everything .,but here at ut it does n't matter who you are .,it 's like everybody starts over .,everybody is giving a clean slate .,"it 's a great chance to prove myself to the people around me , my family , and me .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.372939 -0.129788 2.66634 0.411661 1.01481 1.304395 0.477534 0.477243 0.839278 -0.980471 -0.150774 -0.590446 1.058139 0.315772 0.557953 0.0 -0.04277 0.040854 0.035186 0.375367 0.138207 0.015992 -1.466104 -1.009396 1.134324 0.326094 0.349909 0.376861 0.874033 0.891559 -1.100231 2.500801 0.319553 1.134843 -0.555432 -0.49493 -1.152493 0.09468 -0.561646 -1.093916 0.821389 -0.739413 -1.264362 -0.021335 -0.378369 -1.108976 1.902776 -0.546961 -0.762813 -0.83762 0.711722 0.053451 0.06572 -0.582169 0.728464 2.310243 0.522211 0.085414 0.60369 -0.604939 -0.515539 1.359724 -0.480161 -0.07575 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.097145 -0.538632 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.065656 -0.337085 -0.422267 -0.364431 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.684769 4.64096 3.974176 4.783659 5.083283 4.076323,1332

well i 've finally sat down to start writing this and i 'm wondering where its going to go .,i do n't feel like i have a whole lot to say though i 'm sure i 'll end up babbling for the next 20 minutes .,its rather cold in here .,i turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold .,i 'm borderline shivering .,i suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as i expected texas to be .,feeling pretty hungry as well .,i have n't eaten since about 9am .,i meant to go get some dinner at kinsolving around 6pm but lost track of time and now they 're closed .,its really annoying how they close so early .,even if i were to go eat at 7pm i 'd end up hungry again before i go to bed and eating microwavable dinners does n't prove particularly satisfying or healthy .,this laptop keyboard is being a real pain as i try to type this .,i 'm not used to it at all because i just got this computer yesterday .,"my poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here , i suppose i should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark .",my roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet .,i 'm a bit bored as it is .,the whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing ( poorly i might add ) crappy punk songs .,judging by his volume and consistency i 'd venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good .,"unfortunately for him , and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite .","oh well , i suppose that is part of dorm life .","as i thought i would i 've found myself making use of suppose , although , and though a little too often .",i think that i think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences ( like this one ) .,i just realized i have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes .,there 's a paragraph break just for style points even though there are n't any of those .,speaking of hurting eyes i 'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile .,its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear .,i do n't feel any eye strain so i 'm hoping its a non factor .,"unfortunately , the fancy ( but cheap ) office chair i bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods .","and i find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner , both for my back and neck .",hopefully its something i 'll adjust too .,in retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea .,it makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this ( you ) .,there i go with the 'although ' again .,its really rather annoying .,my constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying .,for some reason i imagine someone with a british accent saying rather everytime i type it .,after i wrote those last few sentences i started thinking of pre-testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul .,which then of course prompted me to wonder how one ( you ) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style .,what does this say about me ?,"i do n't know , nor do i care .",although ( dammit ) i would once again venture a guess and say nothing .,boy time flies when you 're babbling and rambling .,i was hoping for some synonym there but it would n't come to me so i just let it go .,thank god i wo n't be taking much in the way of english courses the next couple years .,writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least .,i feel a headache coming on now .,probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 2 hours or so .,although ( i ca n't stop myself ) i 've sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects .,i often wish i knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so i would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing .,i recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by

why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty and unimportant things ?,it seems as though when we leave the mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all the more important .,when my roommate and i went shopping at the galleria mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present .,girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money onto daddy 's credit cards .,have many teens forgotten about the value and importance of money ?,i also this weekend began to wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and homophobic .,my new friend kenny happens to be fixated on getting dates'girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes him .,the entire time at the mall kenny asked my roommate and i if random people were hotter than he was .,this relentless insecurity and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining .,why ca n't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy at that ?,society 's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and relationships .,most people seek relationships on all levels with people who share the same interests and personality traits that support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that they themselves may not think on their own .,why is love and relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen 's life .,i myself have realized recently that i 've spent a great many years in relationships loving someone and being loved in return .,"we as a society place so much emphasis on dating , relationships , and marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at such goals .",i mean look at the fixation that many college age individuals have on dating shows .,in high school many an ap calculus class were spent discussing elimidate and the trashy or sexy guys'girls that were on the particular episode .,"i myself admit to watching the trash , but for some reason society has aimed my eye to these sort of shows .",since i arrived on campus dorm life has truly agreed with me .,i worried for months that my roomate would be just dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common .,"fortunately , my roommate and i have a great deal in common and are turning out to be great friends .",the university has also provided me with many unexpected opportunities .,"besides the rec center , i 'm signing up for rock climbing , the music school has turned out to be unexpectedly positive .",i have played the violin since i was 8 years old .,in the past year i have realinzed that i genuinely desired to teach music in elementary school .,when i arrived at ut on the first day of school i was terrified of auditioning for the ut symphony orchestra .,when i arrived outside of professor noe 's office i was greeted by many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me .,my nerves seemed to overwhelm me as i walked in the room .,all i could think about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me .,i felt that the audition went well but i was forced to wait the entire weekend for the results .,as it turned out my audition had gone as well as i had felt .,i was seated 10th chair in the orchestra in the 1st violin section .,i ca n't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting people .,"alas , i have to go to work and spend my entire weekend hosting , babysitting , and waiting tables .",hopefully everyone will come home from college on friday so we can catch up on all the new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other 's company ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"september 4 , 1997 i am not too sure what to write about .",i am hungry right now .,"i have anorexia nervosa , so i not only am constantly thinking about food , i also wo n't allow myself to eat it when i want it .",i am actually in the recovery stages right now .,"i have been battling this for two years now , have been in the hospital twice , and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling , psychiatry , and group therapy .",the only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy .,that treatment would be out of state ( in arizona ) and would last at least 60 days .,"it does n't sound appealing to me at all , but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with , it still does n't make it any easier to eat .",the battle is all in my head .,"it is my mind that will not `` allow '' me to eat when i am hungry , and it is my mind that tells me i do n't need to gain weight , that i am not critically underweight , and that i am physically in good shape .",the whole thing is very confusing to me .,"my psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing , but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind .",i think this class is interesting so far .,i have enjoyed reading in the book already because i deal with this stuff on a daily basis .,"i am constantly battling my mind , and trying to figure out its trickery .",my psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones i am taking this semester .,( i think she 's a little partial to the subject myself .,") i have to go see her on tuesday , which is only 5 days away and i am scared half to death .","she scares me with her threats to send me to treatment , but like i said , apparently it does n't scare me enough because it does n't make it any easier for me to eat .","right now , she has threatened me by saying i will have to go to the treatment center if i have n't gained 15 pounds by a certain date .",that date is coming up in two weeks .,i have had this agreement with her since the end of june .,i am really very scared because i really do not think i have gained near that much .,it 's strange how i can think about it realistically and know that i am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me i am fine and do n't need to gain .,"but , as the date comes closer to my appointment , i will start to gradually get more afraid , and get mad at myself for not doing enough .","and still , that wo n't make it any easier to eat a thing .",you have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder .,"you wo n't want to do it , you 'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go .","i have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital ) , but i have n't been able to do much of this by myself .",it seems like it is n't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety .,"instead , by ignoring it , you get to feel hungry , tired , irritable , you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight , you make your family freak out , you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to",college .,"it seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten , and i can logically see that .","my mind is just totally screwed up , which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase .",i hope i will make it to the point soon .,it 's just all too confusing to explain .,"i am sure everyone thinks i am crazy , but you just ca n't explain to someone how you feel .",i wish there was a cure or some more insight to it .,i am interested in what this class has to say about things like this .,maybe i 'll get some more insight into it ( if that is possible since i live it !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

have cried .,"right before i was about to walk out for my interview though , on chance i called back a lady that i had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art

right now i am thinking about this writing assignment .,i am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort i will have to put into it .,it appears to be low effort on both fronts .,i have two conflicting thoughts now .,on one side the easies gives me more time to relax .,it is night now and i am not really in the relaxing mood .,i want to go out and do something but somehow i am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than i was living with my parents .,my expectations of independence have not been meet yet .,i am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that .,i tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out .,"speaking of throwing things out , the trash is damn full .",this assignment is already starting to bore me and i just started it .,i wish i did n't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that i could dedicate my time to .,i find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging .,"when things are n't challenging , i must event a challenging task or at least a large one .",physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed .,now i workout for relaxation and for selfimage .,naturally i am shy .,this bothers me because being shy involves things that do n't make sense to me .,i really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if i do n't remind myself of these things talking to someone is n't a natural reaction .,i am pronature in many respects .,i am against the taking of medicine to the point wo n't take aspirin .,i am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods .,i am surprised i have n't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing i am more surprised at is that i have had none .,and now that i think about it i have n't had any for a long time .,i used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it did n't matter any more .,i got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed .,i was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed i have n't .,i do n't let anything affect me anymore .,"i have been away from my mom , dad , brother , sister , and dog and i do n't really miss them .",talking about the past too long also bores me .,i like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement .,it gives me excitement because i look forward to bigger and better things .,right now i ca n't define things .,"things used to be money , wife , good friends , and children .",i dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear .,bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind .,i have had a spiritual awakening .,"i not religious , in the sense i do n't go to church .",but i try to communicate with god in more subtle ways .,"i have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen , something good will happen .",i never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe .,the first night i was here i left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when i came back it had been found and returned to me .,i left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me .,"when i came back for it , it was gone .",i emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and i was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars .,luck is one of those things i do n't have .,i would never rely on chance more than i had too .,it was not luck my book was returned .,i am glad i am at ut or for that case away from home .,my mom is very pessimistic and impatient .,these thing irritate me to the point where i like avoiding her .,a categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in god but they do n't truly .,they are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me .,i have a friend who is always lying .,i think he does it to make people envy him .,but i do n't think he realizes i do n't envy people i just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them .,my mind is at a blank now .,i am only thinking about the humming of the computer .,time is up ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"well , my first psychology writing assignment , actually my frist real psychology assignment ever , in college .",so technically this is my first assignment in the major of my choice .,stream-of-conciousness .,like weird faulkner stream-of-conciousness .,that was weird .,"hopefully my thoughts arent as weird as that character , well i ca n't even think of the book or the characters at the moment .",so it didnt make that much of an impression upon me .,i really am mad that i ca n't use my own computer for this assignment .,smoothies on keyboards do n't make for easy using of all the keys .,"so here i am , in this girl across the hall from me 's room , using her computer , trying to focus upon my thoughts and whatnot while people are playing loud music , opening boxes of poptarts , slapping me for writing about them in my first psychology","assignment , etc .",i ca n't work when its too loud .,of course the main problem with this whole stream-of-conciousness assignment is that now i am think about what i am thinking about .,take a minute on that one .,"am i really writing what i am thinking about or what i want you , whoever is reading it , to read .",ok now to focus more .,this is one of the weirdest assignments i 've ever done .,"but i will confess , i 've thought about writing a book in stream of conciousness style before .","faulkner , joyce ( he wrote that way didnt he ?",) and russell .,"it ca n't be too hard , but to be honest when your thinking about the things your smelling and feeling and seeing , its not just whatever on the paper .",") ahhh , the smell of poptarts wafting through the air .","definately chocolate , maybe s'more .","it smells so warm , and inviting and delicious .",it even makes the delicious stir-fry in jester .,i had stir fry today .,"the chicken was gross , the vegetables stale , almost a chore to chew it .","so i did what all reasonable people would do , threw it away .","despite all the starving children throughout the world , etc .",money is going fast here .,"faster than i thought , its going to be a pain to call and ask the parents for some more cash .","but its not like it will be the first time , or even the last .","theres just some things in life that are expected , and one of them , is asking the 'rents for money .",i hope my stream-of-conciousness writing is psuedo-interesting .,"i mean of course it wo n't be faulkner , but after all who is .",would i want it to be too faulkner ?,"i do n't think so , i would probably become more of a study in psych than a student .","i wish i wouldnt have known anything about faulkner before this assignment , because in the back of my head , i see his dashes , random .","things , and mine isnt looking like that .",oh well .,my hand is beginning to hurt a bit from typing non-stop .,"oh well , in the name of science !","okay , people here are starting to talk to me while im trying to concentrate .","talking about dust , and ac .","and yes , of course when you use ac , dust increases .",its a positive correleation .,people are starting to laugh at me and call me faulkner .,"all in good fun , yes i know .",i 'll show them .,haha .,"i want this girl to play howie day , and she wont .",stubborn thing .,"music , its funny to think about , there are so many kinds .",wow .,i know about .,100000 songs .,i think its safe to assume that .,"whenever you assume , though , it makes an ass out of you and me .",my old psych teacher used to spit those sayings at us during senior year .,she was a little off her rocker .,"she worked at dorthea-dix , but i think she used to be a patient there .",either way it was funny to watch her .,"mrs. cheek , the cheekster , shivers .",wow .,she was wild .,coco the gorilla .,that 's all the lady would talk about .,it was like coco was her damn gorilla or something .,"haha , wow .",everything related to coco .,funny old woman .,"and she would knit , all day , during class during lunch .",she was odd .,but who 's to say whats normal ?,"im starting to think of this one time , when my mom told me that 6 % of the world was sane .","first off , that means there are a heck of a lot of crazy people running around .","but then you start to think , 6 % , holy mackeral , which side am i on ?","and then you finally realize , you arent one of those 6 % whose 'normal ' .","either way , its fine .",i love psychology .,"its bad , like cool bad , not bad bad .",i worked two summers ago with a research psychologist in the va'baylor labs at the medical center in houston .,i saw all kinds of interesting things .,brain-slicing and the likes .,"this doc that i worked with , dr. kunik , was a card .",i went with him to rounds .,mr. rogers .,"the man , about 86 , called me michelle pfiffer , and claimed that birds and horses around his house told him to kill the jews , and his wife .","the thing was , his wife was dead .","either way , it was interesting .",there were so many like that .,it was wild .,"then , came the multiple personalities .","not for me , but i learned about them in psych class and read 'sybil ' and then i was off .",i read 'when rabbit howls'- whoa .,how interesting though !,"oh no , i only have 2 minutes left , i want to keep talking about multiples .","anyway , then i read ' i never promised you a rose garden ' , that threw me off .",she was a little weird .,"but hey , do n't forget about that 6 % , we all are .",this wasnt so bad after all .,"i didnt really focus on things i was smelling or feeling , well kinda .","just mainly what i was thinking , which was enough for me , and i mean after all , i 'm no faulkner , thank god .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"just like everyone else 's writings , i 'm sure starting off with i do n't know what to write is commonplace .",we used to have to write like this in english last year but mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like `` king kong '' or `` umbrellas '' .,"she was the coolest teacher , she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too .","a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though , especially when we had to do the `` hobbitt '' project and austin named one of the characters `` dildo daggins '' .",that was interesting because mrs. williams could n't really hear them say `` dildo '' and wondered why the class was laughing so hard .,i was n't in that class but i got to hear all about it .,"i really miss all those guys , we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together .",by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. i think that says a lot about us .,there are others that i 've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes .,this annoying `` firewall alert '' keeps popping up on my screen and it 's bugging the fire out of me cause i do n't like computers to begin with and i ca n't get it to stop .,kinda like our smoke detector .,it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it .,my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said `` is that thing still beeping ?,'' and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it .,so i went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least monday because the maintenance crew does n't work on the weekends .,it really sucks cause i could n't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds .,i ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so i guess it worked out .,i think i 'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and i 've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause i 'm always at my guy friends ' place .,oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector .,"i do n't know where my roommate is , she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and i left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it 's almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and",shut off the hot water heater .,my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents ( in south austin ) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater .,"i do n't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors , which would be a lot more convenient ( sp ?",) for me since i do n't have a car .,"i called two of my friends to see if i could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone , so maybe my roommate will take me out there later .",i wish i could drive her car but it 's a standard and i 'm not very good at them .,"i got my nose re-pierced last night , chasity ( my roommate ) went with me .",i got it done when i was in ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $ 30 !,i wanted to scream .,but oh well- it 'll be there for a while .,"i took it out when i got home from ecuador because i did n't know how my parents would feel about it , and i know my dad 's parents would shit bricks if they saw it , so i decided to play it cool and take it out when","i was around my parents or grandparents , but it became too much of a hassle and i left it out too long .",i really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone .,i have a white one i got while i was in ecuador that i 'm going to change out pretty soon .,my roommate has her nose pierced too .,i ca n't wait to show my brother .,i called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that i did it without him because i had told him that i 'd get it done before i left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened .,it 's a big thing in chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from chile .,"i really miss ecuador- i ca n't wait to go back , even though i do n't speak the language very well i made a lot of great relationships .","this one guy , dandle , from chile , really had an impact on me .",we still talk through e-mail daily and it 's awesome to see things from his perspective .,he is the person i 'd most like to see again .,"he taught himself to speak english- he is never had a formal english lesson , and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister .",i 'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself .,i really wish i had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help i suppose .,the time 's almost up- i really did n't think i 'd be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it 's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

lately because i am in a new place with new people everything is new .,sometimes new is fun like in relationships .,new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another .,like my roommate and i are very tired of each other right now .,every little thing she does annoys me and i am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits .,i have several annoying ones .,"my boyfriend says he has not found any , but that leads back to the whole newness thing .",he does n't quite know me .,and i 'm not quite sure i want him to .,i want some mcdonald 's right now because i am starving i have n't eaten since this morning because i have been running all over campus getting things done .,i went to a meeting for the pom squad tryouts and i had a memory rush from high school the chick who is the director is one of my old drill team director 's friends and lets just say i do n't like to think of drill team much .,although it seems to be on my mind alot lately because i have been questioning weather or not i should be in kilgore or not .,"i am really truly happy for tracy and brooke and regina , but i ca n't help but be envious .",i know regina is loving shoving this in my face but i wish she would n't why ca n't we just be friends again like we were last year all of this other crap had to start and now its finished kind of .,i guess not totally finished because i am still stringing earl along .,i do n't mean to be so selfish but i like having someone there for security .,i have always been given security from my parents and i am used to that feeling i miss my parents they do so much for me like my mom getting this new job one that i do n't even know if she likes just to make more money so i,can go to ut .,my sister loves to spend my parents money and i am finding out how easy it is when you 're far from home and you do n't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us .,i can not even fathom what having a child must be like sometimes i want to have children and get married and settle down and other times i do n't want any of that mushy stuff .,that is kind of what earl is there for .,incase i decide to pursue the romantic side in me which i seriously doubt so i should just let him go and i am really bad at typing i used to be better but i guess i am a little out of practice i tool 2 typing classes in high,school which i had a nice time in we have such an awesome senior class .,i was so proud but now everybody is gone off to do their own thing i ca n't spell either i have always had that problem ever since i was little my whole family makes fun of me for it especially my sister .,i wonder how long i have been typing i have n't typed like this since staying up all night writing and typing my senior research paper on shakespeare .,i love ms. holloway she was a great teacher i wonder how heather is doing in atlanta i should call her tonight and see if she likes her class .,it would be awesome to live in georgia the indigo girls are from athens georgia and i have always wanted to go there and see their home town i think where people are from say alot about them .,"like my cousin is from angleton and she a real heavy accent her whole family does i hope she is ok. she went a little crazy after her father died , but who would n't my mother is crazy .",poor woman is going through so much right now and suzanne has to be feeling the same way with both of her daughters moving out at the same time ., , , , , , , ,

whenever i go home and i do n't like it very much .,i have even started to call austin home .,"this really bothers some of my friends , mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller .",i miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that i dislike being at home .,i love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad .,"i love my dad too , he and my mom are my favorite

that she does .,"she got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense , which isnt good when you are going to a school like ut .","i love my sister a lot , i just do n't know if she likes me that much .",we have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry .,and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes .,i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much .,"right now , i am rally worried about my friend , his dad died not long ago , and i do n't know how he is doing .","he drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried , but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet .",i think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something .,"i really do n't know if i can type for another ten minutes , i thought that this time would fly by , but it is actually going really slow .",i also do n't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses .,"anyways , my favorite thing to do in the whole world is dance .",i have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in .,dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better .,i love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability .,"but , it is

school right now .,"aside from my weird sleeping schedule , i also am really weird when it comes to eating .","i do n't think that i have an eating disorder , but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag , or go through times when i just do n't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick .",i think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic .,"i do admit that i am very small , but not discustingly so .","i have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room ,

in my apartment though , my roomates are so cool , and they are really nice to me .",i hope that they like me as much as i like them .,"i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though , like i am invading their territory because , they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture .",i am going home this weekend for my boyfriends birthday .,i miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to ut .,"i do n't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been , plus , he just got into a frat , and i do n't really like the idea of that too much .",i have less than two minutes left and i have absolutely no clue of what to write .,i think that after i am done with this i am going to go eat some lasagne .,i have a huge craving for it right now for some reason .,i think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops .,hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing .,i know that i would not want that job ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i 'm feeling relieved that i was able to get here the last couple of times i tried to get to this site the computer told me the site was unavailable .,very frustrating !,"i like this assignment , although i 'm not sure why 20 minutes are necessary ; it seems to me that 10 or even 5 minutes would do .","i 'm really not sure what to write next i have n't done this kind of thing since seventh grade , when i was home schooled .",it 's weird how your mind goes blank sometimes .,i still do n't know what to write .,"my thoughts are mostly involved with ut , with classes and so forth .","i like them , in general , but only one has been intellectually stimulating so far ( no , i am not going to tell you which one !",") i have great hopes for the rest , though sometimes it takes a while for a class to get into gear .",do n't know what to write .,do n't know what to write .,"feeling frustrated , i guess .",i was afraid i would n't think of anything to write .,"it 's not that i have a sluggish or inactive mind quite the opposite , actually .",it 's just that sometimes i do n't do well when i have to write it down .,"which is strange , because i love to write .","i keep a journal ( which you , prof. pennebaker , would probably find interesting ) and enjoy writing in it my gripes , hopes , fears , joys and other important stuff .",maybe i 'm just not good at this kind of structured work .,"i 'm lefthanded , prof. p does that have anything to do with it ?","i have a vivid imagination , and am inclined to daydream .","hey i just remembered , you said these were confidential .",i can write anything i want !,"i do n't feel any freer with that in mind , however .",i 'm stuck again .,still stuck .,i wonder how many of my fellow classmates have the same trouble i do with this .,stuck .,now i 'm thinking of the guy i like .,"( i 'm not going to give his name , because i 'm serious about him , and i 'm not sure just exactly how confidential this really is .",") i wonder if you actually read any of these , just to see what kind of people are in your class .","i know that if you really picked my brain you 'd have some interesting stuff ( interesting in a good way , of course !",") this is a tumultuous and crazy time in my life , although most people would think it tame .","my beliefs are undergoing an overhaul , and everything seems to be up in the air .","that 's not a good feeling , but it 's never dull !","i think in the last few months i 've learned a lot about prejudice and tolerance , and i 'm glad i 'm learning what i am , even if it destroys my plans for perfect happiness ( sarcasm there ) .",what kind of a world is it where people who search for truth risk having everything they want taken away ?,this ca n't be right .,"but it 's true , and there 's no denying it .",this makes me feel apprehensive and sad .,"i feel some anger at the world , and at god too .","( yes , prof. pennebaker , i believe there is a god !",") but real religion requires immense amounts of faith , and i have to trust that everything will end up ok. now i feel slightly reassured .",if only everything were n't so uncertain !,but do i really want a world where you know exactly what 's going to happen next ?,"what if you knew when bad things were going to happen , but were powerless to prevent any of them , because everything was predestined ?","it 's

to happen next in most cases .","but in some , like who i 'm going to marry , i can barely contain my curiosity .","i guess that 's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life , that i so strongly feel the need for another one .","but whatever happens , i refuse to worry if everything 's predestined , i ca n't change it anyway , and if it is , then i can still change things for the better .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes .,but i 'll definitely need to leave in around thirty .,that boy michael was really cute .,really cute .,he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet .,ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself .,that 's one of the things i do n't like about this school .,no one introduces themselves to each other .,it 's like everyone only cares about their own lives and wo n't be bothered by anyone else 's .,but you know what .,"i think everyone else wants to meet people too , at least the majority but they just do n't know how to go about doing it so they act like they do n't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for",anyone else .,it 's very sad i think .,"at the beginning everyone is all excited , expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person .","now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person , they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral .",just because we all fear a little bit of rejection .,sad really .,that was my friend matt from economics class .,he 's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class .,he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet .,i 'm going to be so behind in economics .,i tell you .,i really like that class though .,so anyways .,i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few .,a very few .,whatever .,i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people .,ugh .,i just put `` so anyways '' instead of `` so anyway '' i think that sounds as dumb as `` laters '' when one really means `` later '' .,that is really very jr. high .,i miss those days .,i wonder how cindy is doing .,ugh .,i really do n't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again .,i 'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart .,damn that sounds really conceited .,maybe i 'm a little of that too .,i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that 's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself .,it 's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself .,it 's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself .,i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty .,but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it .,within reason that is .,so anyway .,i am these things but i feel like people do n't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted .,i know they will like me if they get to know me but it 's that introducing part that is really limiting .,kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely .,i am so proud of myself lately .,i am being such a good girl .,although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today 's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy 's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway .,i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp .,when they are unimportant .,i 'm really irritated by that .,but back to the story .,i have been developing such good habits .,"i make my bed everyday , i wash my face twice a day , i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early .",o shit .,i just got a little flash of procrastination .,that sneaky devil .,no go away !,i 'm not going to be a procrastinator this year .,i just do n't have the time for that .,i run every day .,mon-thurs .,2 miles a day .,plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that 's always nice .,kind of a motivating factor .,when i get back from the convocation i 'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up .,damn that dinner .,ugh .,what else do i do .,o yea .,i did n't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too .,i have n't been drinking .,i have n't been too flakey .,with the exception of ross but that 's quite not my fault most of the time .,anyway we are good terms at the present .,i 'm being a pretty good daughter .,i finished my scholarship applications stuff .,what to write about now .,i want to write about something cool .,no luck .,i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes .,bad flutes in lol .,i 'm probably really bad by now .,i wonder if there is practice rooms around .,i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway .,i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here .,i thought they 'd be all confident and just come up to you .,and then i would act all shy and innocent .,it 's just how i act .,natural reflex to wanted attention .,sometimes i think i 'm so stupid .,and then they would flatter me and ask me out .,and i would act like i was n't really sure .,i little bit suspicious of their motives .,( and rightly so i imagine ) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely .,well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away .,see yaw

do n't want to stop writing thud somebody 's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh i ca n't stop writing because if i did it would,be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school i 'm looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm i was mildly planning on drawing up,a petition with the other girls in order to get one i was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god i ca n't wait to use the sorority koozie i got on bid day for some reason i,"do n't like flashing around and advertising the fact that i 'm in a sorority , not that i 'm not proud of my sorority it 's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my t-shirt i mean",i 'm no longer lindsey ( blank ) but i am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so i 'd rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it 's only 12:07,boy i 've never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self i wonder if i 'll be able to swing this college life i mean i want to do well so well so i can prove it to my mom that,i can do it yet i want to party a lot i know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because i still have n't attached the back part to my computer chair b ' c this task requires me to use some tool,"that i do n't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie , speaking of computers i put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am i proud it arrived in 4 foot","3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section , god my eyes are starting to get tired but i really have no reason to go to bed b ' c i have no classes before 12 and",i 'm not a morning person and i already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and i do n't want to be too tired to party because i 've risen before 10:00 am .,so i have many incentives to not go to bed and i feel like shit if i get more than 8 hours of sleep i 'm one of those always got to be busy people so i ca n't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it,"is sleeping late in the morning yet i feel like a slug if i sleep to late actually i feel guilty as if i 'm wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching , i 'm so proud","of myself that i am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that i 'm off to a good start see i just ca n't fathom how some girls i know are already missing class , i mean what the hell else do you have to do","here but occasionally study , party , and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade , but i should n't necessarily jump on a soap box because i never know how",long i will remain this disciplined .,kick ass it 's 12:18 and i 'm signing off !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

why am i being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department ?,the entire situation is abhorrent .,"it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not

one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening , then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing .","insulting one 's life work is no good , but this is how i feel and know it to be .","because i have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that i am mistaken , but i do not doubt myself .","the problem with natural selection is that has been warped , mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough .","we have tinkered with natural selection , tried to control it , and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak .",this i know .,what to do about it ?,i do n't .,these negative things come to mind whenever i am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness .,"it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college , do not want to be in college for the sake of learning having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp , willing brains .",i have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference .,maybe it 's not even a timerelation thing .,"again , it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new , malignant form of `` natural '' selection .","if this sounds disturbing , well it is .","i do n't appreciated being forced to submit and i emphasize that word , my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department .",this has nothing to do with my benefit .,i could and do this often on my own time .,"but i am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment , and for what ?","i do n't exactly know , and that makes it worse .","i have few things of value in this world , but i do have my mind and my intellectual property .",i do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a phd .,but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works

.",not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved .,"these are the people who should be selected out , yet are not .",how did this come to be ?,i do n't know .,"maybe television is

think in images , sounds , smells , etc ?",how are you to know how i think ?,stream of consciousness is not writing .,it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do .,"if animals could talk or write , stream of consciousness is what they would do .","thank god , my time is almost up .","i suppose i should say that i 've never met a psych major that i liked or respected , since that is what just popped into my head .","in submitting this , i suppose i am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please , plagiarize , or otherwise .","it is no longer my property , i have been forced to give up a part of my mind .",so it can be categorized and used as someone 's research and study .,"i will fit into the category of bitter , paranoid lesbian female from small town

"i 'm starting to write this at six twenty five , it 's really cold in this computer lab , i wish they would turn the air conditioner down , do they know how to do that , would they do it if i asked

to write everything that i think and i type a","lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , i am not thinking of much right now , the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it , he probably wo n't read it though , and he probably wo","n't really think it is dumb , there are probably students who write dumber ones than me .","i am horrible at typing , i am making all kinds of mistakes , i hope i can read this a when i finish it , or else there will be a problem , brrrr it 's really cold in here , i sure wish they would make it warmer","my

have about ten minutes","of typing left , i just heard someone 's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab , i always hear phones ring in here anyways , i wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that , they should turn their","phones off , so they do n't disrupt other people , even though personally it does n't bother me if i hear a phone ring but i guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying",", gosh i ca n't spell worth anything , i 'm hardly going to be able to read this when i get done , i hope i can decipher it , my feet are freezing , i keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that 's the",point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated .,"i wonder if its raining outside , that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere , i wonder why i thought of that , hhhmmm , i saw all the clouds earlier outside , it was really dark and scary looking , i hope it rains a","lot more , more than yesterday , it did n't rain enough yesterday , i love when it rains , it 's better than the sunshine , i

me , i wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me , i hope some of them did , but i guess that 's not a good thing to hope considering i have","a boyfriend , i really miss my boyfriend a lot ,

this typing is probably the worse i 've ever done , i only have a couple of minutes left to go , gosh time really went but fast since i was just typing anything i thought , i wonder if the professor will really read this , he is","a really cool professor , i like him a lot , but now if he does read this he 's probably going to think i was sucking up to him but that 's not true cause i really love psychology , that 's a hard word to spell , well","its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it 's spelled , i remember when i was in the spelling bee in 4th grade , i think it was fourth grade , maybe it was third , i remember my ex best friend who was","in my third grade class , i did n't really know her then but now she is really stupid but i do n't really want to think about

i begin by wondering exactly what purpose this assignment serves .,i also wonder what will pass as the year goes on .,caffeine .,i suddenly have a craving for caffeine .,"i would get up and grab a dr. pepper , but that would interrupt my writing process .",what would it be like to be known as dr. steve ?,do i really intend to go through with getting my doctorate ?,"and if so , what happens afterwards ?",it boggles the mind to think of the ways in which i may change over the next several years .,"wow , i certainly am typing fast .","on my old computer , there would have been a delay between the time i pushed the keys and when they appeared on the screen .","i very much like this new flatscreen , it certainly goes well with my new system .",every computer i build has some odd quirk to it that no other system demonstrates .,"it may be my fondness for ati video cards , or it could be my personality reflecting in the way that i put these things together .","all in all , the system works well , but there are times when i just want to drop-kick it out the window .","that , however would involve opening the blinds , which would expose me to the eye-squinting sunlight .","i have always rather disliked the direct sunlight , partly because it is directly associated with heat .","i can stand heat when it causes immediate , measurable pain , such as the burning of a hot pan handle .","however , the discomfort of extended exposure to the hot , sticky , mind-numbing texas sun can drive me insane !","there is a point after which i do not care , but sometimes it seems as if that point never comes .",time is certainly a subjective concept to the human brain .,the saying time flies when you 're having fun '' is absolutely true in this respect .,"if only it were the other way around : uncomfortable situations seem shorter , and the pleasant experiences extended .","alas , that is merely wishful thinking .",my roommate 's girlfriend just called three times within a 15-minute period .,"ah , there he is .","`` the ol ' ball and chain just called '' , says i. what an interesting concept this telephone is .","from pretty much anywhere in the world , you can have instant contact with anyone else that has a similar device .","of course , there is a slight delay due to the limits of the speed of light , but as long as you are on earth , this is a relatively slight matter .","last week , i spent time with my family looking at mars in my dad 's telescope .","mars will not be closer for next to 250 years , and it has n't been this close in nearly 60,000 years .","from what i have read and heard , though , it has been within a few hundred miles of this distance in the last several years .",calling last week an especially special occasion is barely the truth .,"the difference is like standing in manhattan , walking 10 steps towards new jersey , and saying that it looks closer .",one-hundred odd miles in over thirty-four million ?,absurd !,"looking at the timer , it appears to be about time to wrap it up .","wow , i just had to correct my spelling on the fly about ten times .",i guess that it 's not as easy to type correctly when there is another person in the room ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.848252 -1.448256 -0.942234 -1.446781 -2.688531 -0.797806 2.705485 3.137642 2.448013 -0.39354 -0.169953 0.775859 1.582006 -1.05742 1.865308 0.0 -0.04277 -2.381924 -1.930504 -0.795527 -2.251061 0.084752 -1.230034 -0.329857 -0.624052 2.340645 0.523474 0.859069 -1.200234 -0.602705 -0.682083 0.202699 -1.074019 0.083267 -0.68165 -1.109326 -0.750647 -1.079534 -1.4494 -0.285507 0.990043 -0.101332 0.84549 1.119601 1.245573 0.664669 0.358927 -0.967373 0.994433 -1.320226 -0.748224 1.787453 -0.775383 -1.201552 0.822543 2.145366 0.762126 -0.954251 0.505291 0.073101 -0.127466 -0.882751 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.16704 1.552408 0.09971 -0.23436 0.70479 0.073529 1.193385 0.82177 -1.039651 -0.451544 -0.408772 0.504006 3.834652 3.529789 4.525413 4.740118 5.133122,2051
"i 'm thinking about if i am going to get the job that i want at the pac at the university it would suck if i did n't i am proud that the otc called me for a job interview , they said my resume especially my volunteer work was",impressive it makes me feel like i did n't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so i ca n't type as fast and i keep having to go back and erase but i like pressure i thrive under it but i do n't,like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words i do not like those because i am so used to using slang that i just do not type it anymore and i also hate having to capitalize my i 's it makes me mad having to go back .,right now i feel a little stress because i am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday i had a meeting and i did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all i could read was biology,which is another class i do n't understand i never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either i feel lost in that class it is so difficult i feel like i dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help,but it is not i just keep thinking about what prof. pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel .,like screaming i guess but the professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home i had a divided keyboard the `` flowy '' ones and now i have this laptop,and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment i like but i feel like i should n't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid i 's and i forgort to put and apostrophe in should n't and the i messed me up again,well forget it no more caps ; the i 's are going to be in lower case .,sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit i need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend i get to go home though i want to go to the game i have not boguht the sports package and i did n't feel,like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot i guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy 's a football player so i feel like i should go for him but i 'm not,going .,now i get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe i 'll get sick when i go home like prof. pennebaker said probably because i feel the migrane coming .,i hate migranes i hate having to find a job hopefully i get a good one i have an interview on tuesday i hope it goes well and that i make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood .,i wonder how the bus works i keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause i have seen it once after running to the engineering building because i was late i saw the bus and i think you,can only take it there which is kind of sucky but i will take a look around and see if that 's how it works .,now i feel like i have run out of things to say i still have to do the experiment for this class i want to do the survey but since i am under 18 i have to get my moms signature and i feel like i should be happy about,going home i mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like `` huh '' and i hope nothings happens like the bus does n't break down or like it is `` kidnapped ' i know i worry too much but i do n't want anything,"to happen even if it means that i have to do all the homework , i 've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys , and what was i talking about i do n't kno , i need to make friends me and","my roommate get along but i need other friends and now i have 5 minutes left , what to write about anyways back to the making friends i saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart asian in the elevator today i feel bad",for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that i have are okay but i do n't really relate to them why i do n't kno i feel like they exclude me too much and they do n't at least i hope they do n't,and if they do i do n't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still i have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really i am,surprised i wrote this much i thought i was going to run out of this to say but i like this assignment when prof. pennebaker said it i was like yes no grammar rules i do n't particularly like grammar but i try i mean i suck at it in,my papers i always score low on it 2 minutes and i have mentioned my time too many times i tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and i did nto so now i keep talking about not because i want the assignment to be ove but,because some one just slammed their door my head hurts i think it is the flourescent lighting i think that is how u spell that and i just put the letter u for the word you and i am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and i,keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh i thought it was over but i am going to stop now because a i do n't want to talk for too long and i have to go turn of this light and i am,thinking about what i just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if i should put my name at the bottom but i wo n't because i have the code thing .,well this was productive and i did not put well in caps ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i know i said that i was ready to write but im not too sure exactly what i need to be doing .,i hope this is right .,great now im worrying .,i worry way too much that is a problem of mine .,i always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it i even worry about other people 's problems .,i wish i could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend joseph .,he 's also my roommate .,now im now sure if this is right because im telling you about myself when im just supposed to be thinking .,okay now im thinking .,why is my room so hot .,sometimes its not hot but right now im boiling .,i think it is because i am nervous about this assignment .,theres no reason to be i just need to type .,well here i am typing .,my room smells funny right now .,joseph bought some cinna sticks from dominoes a while back and i think that they are going bvad .,i know they are going bad .,i need to take out the trash than .,i hate that i get lazy and do n't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob .,great now i propbably sound all anal about mess when im not at all like that .,well im not a messy person but you know .,gosh reading over this i sound like such a pessimist and so boring .,oh well .,time sure is going by pretty slow .,i want to make jell-o but i do n't think i have room in fridge for it .,gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now .,i wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o .,like how does it form the way it does ?,whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o .,one day im going to find out .,more than likely i wo n't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that im gooing to look into it .,it makes me feel productive .,im worried about my financial situation right now .,i still have almost 4000 to pay off and i got a loan for that and all but i do n't know where that money is or who i need to talk to in order to get my hands on it .,tomorrow i guess ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that .,i ca n't think of anything else right now .,i feel like im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am i to say no .,this should be an easy a or at least i hope .,i hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because i said easy a then im going to get like a b or something .,"just in case im sorry even if this seems easy i do my work and i dedicate time so when it comes down to it , i think i deserve that a .",great im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment .,i wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance ?,i doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up .,but then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them .,ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient .,is lenient even a word ?,"oh well anyhow the teacher , her name was ms. ng , she scored perfect on her sat 's .",how the heck did she ever pull that off .,and since she did i have no idea why shes teaching at edison .,in case you dopnt know which you probably do n't edison is a public inner-city school in san antonio and it does not have the best of reputations .,i hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to ?,and that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond edison .,esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from edison .,well thats their loss because im a great person to know and i do n't fit the edison stereotype .,there should be no stereotypes .,they are just not fair .,hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up .,just 35 more seconds .,30 now .,wow this is actually good stress relief i should do this more often when i have time ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

this is my first writing assignment .,i 'm watching cosby on tv .,i have a headache .,i 've had a headache most of today .,i woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep .,i had a stomach ache and felt like i was going to be sick .,i had a headache and did n't feel like doing anything .,so i got back in bed for a little bit .,then went over to the san jac food place for some oj .,that worked out pretty good i think for breakfast .,i think from now on on mwf i 'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus .,that class is going pretty good .,i was supposed to have a study group tonight but i called everyone and nobody could go .,so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up could n't make it .,but i do n't really need it .,i think i 'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group .,i had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the ap test so i 'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since i 'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff .,i was thinking about switching majors to psych cause i really enjoyed everything i learned in high school when i took it .,i do n't know if i 'll switch over though yet .,i 'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we 'll just see where the year goes .,all day i 've felt like crap and i miss my best friend mariko so much .,especially today since i 've felt bad .,she always makes me feel better .,it 's really tough being here at college 2 1 ' 2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks .,i 'd come home every weekend if i had my car up here but my mom did n't let me bring my car up this year .,i 'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it 's not part of the college experience .,i do n't care about the experience .,i 'm here to learn and i do that during the week .,i do all my homework when i need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends .,so why ca n't i come home and spend my time with the one person i want to spend time with .,well i know people here that have offered me rides so i can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko .,my mom was mad this past weekend cause i spent most of my time with mariko .,and my mom said she did n't bring me home just to hang out with her .,well from now on i 'll get rides home from other people so i can spend my time with who i want since my mom wo n't be wasting her time driving and getting me .,"i feel bad for thinking that , but that 's just how i feel .","i love my mom and everything , but i 'm not really close to her at all , and i 've been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything .",and i am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease .,i 'm so close to mariko and i love her so much and it 's just hard being away from her .,she goes to japan every summer with her family .,i 've been thinking about going next summer .,i 'd have to talk with her parents about that though .,but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and i 'd have to stay with mariko 's family in japan otherwise i would n't be able to afford a hotel for a month .,"so that would cost me a ton of money , and then i 've been thinking about going on a mission for the church also .",i really want to go .,my mom 's really against the religion i 've joined .,she is just heard too many things that are n't true .,and i hate how she feels .,but through religion i 've learned how to deal with all these feelings and i 'm comforted now and i forgive my mom for how she feels because she just does n't know any better .,i 'm kind of tired and i still have a headache .,i want something to drink .,"the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time i checked , and right now i do n't want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out .","i do n't ' feel like a sprite either , i could go down to san jac again .",i think they 're closed though .,my shoulders have been hurting lately .,my neck really hurts too .,my neck just started today .,but my shoulders have been hurting for a while .,usually after sitting in a class after an hour .,i need to move around more or something i guess .,my hands are freezing cold .,there 's no thermostat in my room so it 's always freezing .,and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and i ca n't stand it .,i put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed .,one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and i put it up again so hopefully it all stays up .,there were already some damages to the ceiling so i guess i wo n't be charged for anything .,the sticky things that are n't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some .,but i do n't think it matters .,oh well .,i have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms .,some on the bulletin board over my bed .,i like waking up with pictures of mariko right there .,i miss her so much .,i hope she had a good day today .,last night she did n't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework .,i do n't know .,sometimes she just goes through phases .,i wish i could help her more but there 's not much i can do .,she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved .,sometimes it just gets tough for her .,and that 's a whole other reason i want to be home still .,so i can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down .,we still talk online all the time and i call sometimes .,it 's hard to find times to call though .,either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then i have classes at certain times so i ca n't just leave and call her .,but i 'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call .,tomorrow 's thursday already so i do n't think i 'll get a couple calls in this week .,i 'll call on the weekend though since i wo n't be going home this weekend .,hopefully i meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute .,i seem to be the youngest person there .,"and i 'm already not a talkative person , so i think it 's going to be kinda hard to meet people .",oh well .,10 seconds left for this thing .,hopefully the rest of the year goes well ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

last night was pretty good and all .,i was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it .,"but who can blame the guy , weslaco is n't exactly the place one would want to be .","i just feel bad for junior , he feels totally alone and stuff .","javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all , but junior never talks to javi because he does n't like what javi does on his spare time , so because of that , he does n't talk to him as much .","i was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk , i miss that guy a lot , i just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something .","he is n't working or going to school , hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning .",all i could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself .,hopefully he 'll be here in austin visiting soon .,"speaking of getting off your ass , i need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating .","high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through ( a walk in the park ) but college is n't the same , needless to say .","dad said this is the rest of my life i 'm preparing for , and there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because i 'm being lazy .","i miss dad , and mom and everyone else .","yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we 're family , only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it .","much like me and my friends , because friends are family too , even knowing more about you than you might through observation .","regardless , i love austin , its a great town , there is so much to do , and a lot of time to do it in , but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation , because too much of a good thing can",be bad for you .,"i hope grandma is ok , i miss waking up and telling her `` buenos dias , como manecio '' and her being amazed that i 'm even at home and even more amazed at the time it is that i wake up .",i just hope nothing happens to her .,i feel sorry for mel and all the trauma that she is probably feeling .,"she just had a kid , her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with , and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her , as well as the threats , in order to get her","to tell them the information they believe she has , but which in fact she does n't .","because no matter how bad the news , she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother would know , because she is like my oldest sister , and she is probably the closest cousin that i may have .","damn , i miss georgie .",stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it .,procrastinator in the making just like me .,"i miss listening to my punk and ska with him , he was the only person that liked it as much as i did , and i didnt even force him to like it .","funny now though , in austin one would say that its a bit `` trendy '' to like this music , but in weslaco .",its not really known .,and even less played on the damn radio .,"speaking of radio , it sux .",except for some stations in austin .,and i do n't know the call letters .,i 'm bad at remembering things .,i guess that may be why i procrastinate .,"my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as i do , so i know he does n't believe me when i say `` i do n't remember '' .","but in fact , i really do n't , and its not because i drink like every day or because i 'm on a drug , because yes i do drink , but not in large quantities ( binge drinking ) like some people and i only do so on","the weekends strictly never on school days , and i do n't do drugs .","speaking of drugs , i knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them , but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away .","already i have open invitations from people i 've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them , and one guy who said he could get me any drug i wanted free for the first time .","i can just brush these things aside because they do n't interest me or anything , but i get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation , but i do n't let that bother me , because if they are going to judge me from","what they hear and not by who i really am , they arent worth my time .","my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said , and i never have .",some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before i had ever met them .,now we 're as close as brothers in a sense .,"i love my friends , i do n't really know what id do without them .","my biggest fear does n't seem to be what kind of future i have or if i will ever be successful , or if i will let my parents down ( god forbid though ) , but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again .","but when i think about it , its the stupidist thing , because today , the world is smaller than ever , and anyone can be found with the click of a button .","so i do n't really know why i feel this way or anything , nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way , so i do n't really have an explanation for this feeling , and being the smart ass that i am making fun of

last week i took a chinese clep test .,"it started out very well , i understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions .","as you know , the cantonese language is written in two different formats .","one way , the tradition way , was the one i learned since i was a little kid .","the other format was a newer , i believe it originated in hong kong or something , was much like the original except more scribbled-looking '' .","anyways , i opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me .",so i spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words .,"then , i decided to just skip through to the end .",that is when i figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format .,`` damn it !,"'' was the first words that rushed through my mind , along with a whole stream of foul consciousness .","but of course , that was last week , and i already have my results back from the test .",i believe i did relatively well .,relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests .,"today , monday , is the first day i have been to my rlm biology discussion , thus making the actual first full week of school .","i must say , i am completely exhausted .",biology discussion was quite an episode .,we had an ta that had a really really bad accent .,"much worse , he tried to give an oral review , and when he asked questions , everyone in the class stared at him blankly .","some ventured a guess softly , but the entire process took most of the discussion period .","then we took a quiz , which i found to be a bit difficult because i did n't understand teh oral review .",i had to buy books today .,spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that i probably wo n't be needing much .,"i

heart attack .",psych class was pretty interesting today .,dr. pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class .,i was completely fascinated by the experiment .,too bad i ca n't say the same for my philosophy class .,"its not a boring class , its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice , almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep .",and so i obeyed .,"i notice that when i 'm sleeping in class , my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby .","but of course , i wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever .",you can definitely tell at what point in the lecture i crashed .,"the funniest part is , i lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class , wishing him good luck .","i think

well i am beginning this assignment and already i 'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing .,"sometimes i wonder why i care about that stuff but i really do n't know , and my mind just wonders endlessly all the time , which i why i think i will enjoy this assignment , once it has been evaluated , because i seem to conjure up the","wildest ideas , and thoughts and feelings when i begin to let my mind roam free .","now i 'm thinking why am i thinking about my thinking which seems really weird , but i guess thats the idea of this experiment , and i am constantly trying to think about what to think about next , so that i 'll have something to type , instead","of leaving a blank screen which would be bad , because then i would get a bad grade , even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion , not on content , which is a good thing because if it was based on content ,","and i had no content , then there would be nothing to grade , and i would have bad grades , and now it just occured to me that i am rambling on about nothing , and making fallacious points as i type , just for the simple reason to","keep typing , which is the main goal of this experiment , and i just heard my roomate coughing in the living room , he is foreign , and sometimes hard to understand , but i think it 's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because","it adds a bit of variety to the mix , and he said that his parents live in yugoslavia , and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in pennsylvania , but had to move here to austin for job reasons , which is why he lives","here , and which is why he goes to austin community college , and i know this because i asked him , and i asked him because i was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country .","he says he likes it here in the states as most foreginers refer to us as , but he , like most teenagers , misses his friends back home , which is why he goes back there every summer to visit , and i guess since he has lived both","places , and experienced both cultures and economies , is why he chose to major in international business , and my other roomate , troy , is a business major at ut , and i am somewhat of a business major , with my major being sports management , which","is in the college of education because it is a branch of kiniesiology , which i do n't know if i spelled right , but i supposed i should learn how , but anyways my major is more of a business major , like troy and djordje , which is","pronounced george , so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times , then i have another roomate named john , whom i have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me , and my mom told his mom that she","doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people , but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to nebraska with him , and his sister lynnsie , we stayed friends , and then his dad who lived in houston at the time ,","moved to san antonio when i was in 7th grade , yet we still remained best friends , though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year .","i figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together , and such good friends throughout the years , and i hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology .","now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but i guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness , rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors .","but anyways , as i was saying there are 3 business majors , then john is a chemical engineer also studying at ut , and he , along with me and troy , who is 22 , are all freshman , and djordje is a sophomore .","i sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old freshman , and to be starting your real life off that late , ever since troy and i have met .","he seems like a very interesting person to me , and i figure i will get to know him better as the year progresses , even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time , rather than socialize together , but i guess its","just nervousness of being alone , and without parents for the first time , and we will soon grow out of it .","speaking of parents , i hate to admit it , but i truly do miss my parents , and especially my dog , a dauschand , bevo , very much .","before i was to leave to move in to my apartment i could n't wait to get out of there , and to get out on my own , figuring to be free of them for good , except for the occassional visits , and i would read the college","things about how to expect home sickness , and i was thinking yeah right , not me , but just a few days after they had left , i already missed them , and i ca n't wait to see them again .","pretty sad on my part i guess on trying to be independent , but oh well , i just want to see my dog again , whom my life would be incomplete without , and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life i","was afraid of dogs , and now i see the clock and i 'm running of out of time , and it said my 20 minutes are up , so thats all i have to say .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"okay , i 'm starting .",i did assignments like this in freshman english back in high school .,it was pretty cool .,"mrs. johnson was a great english teacher , but she scared me sometimes , like when

of her points she made was over censorship , she took the book away from us .",we could n't even go to the school library to finish it .,i guess she got her point across .,"another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment , you can get it done .","before we read animal farm , she split us up into groups , sheep , pigs , dogs , chicken , and we had to have a campaign

i wonder if he is thinking of me ?,i am glad i am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now .,i need to do all this as soon as i get it .,i had done this before but i could not submit it .,i have something special with alex and i know how he feels and he is different .,he is n't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me .,i hope not to hurt him .,i need him and need someone like that .,someone to take care of me and to be there for me if i need to talk someone to talk to me and someone that i can take care of and love too .,he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful .,he will never know i guess .,he is there for me when i most needed him .,he has held me when i cried and has made me laugh when i was sad ' i owe a lot to him .,we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun .,i wonder if he knows how much fun i have had with him .,i do n't think he understands .,"i am going through a hard time and i am going through a big transition , but i think i am doing fairly well .",i have not cried much .,my roommate went home this weekend and i felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with .,we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other .,we are okay now .,my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too .,"i do n't want to be with him anymore , yet he still persists .",he know that i am dating alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with .,i want to get away from that i am tired of having to answer questions about my own life .,i want to be free and to be able to do what i want and that i think is right not what other people think i should do .,it is n't fair to me if i have to make someone else happy before i could do things for my own freedom .,it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply ca n't be an individual .,there are many things to do here in austin and many many people to meet and make friends with .,i have had a good time so far and i have enjoyed going to class and learning .,although i do think that i should read a little more .,i will be fine though .,claudia and alex will be there if i need anything ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.946006 -0.852122 1.151191 -0.473176 0.416394 0.42578 -1.106478 -0.604976 -0.991343 -0.579086 -0.135489 -0.155712 -0.920094 2.043058 -1.026971 0.0 -0.04277 1.824388 0.349393 1.378561 0.739872 -0.138895 1.763369 1.796475 0.775195 -1.68502 -0.169986 -0.99949 0.993186 1.299018 2.56078 0.803885 0.048762 -0.906028 -0.281836 2.31306 1.284196 -0.330735 1.758646 1.409571 -0.298623 -0.174861 -1.109346 -0.090167 -0.593058 0.182862 0.496052 1.832265 1.259917 2.324243 0.291253 -0.887454 1.091212 1.863087 1.889113 -0.635839 -1.772902 -0.954251 2.497352 -0.07225 0.043653 -1.207577 -0.480161 -0.212478 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.227414 -1.17679 -0.073676 -0.23436 0.828717 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.095545 -0.451544 -0.058358 -1.151387 5.185604 4.352342 4.389569 4.956902 4.652339,575
"i guess i have a life now , which is great for me .",i always wanted one .,"well , i did have a life before .","i grew up in san antonio and i have 4 brothers and sister and along with nadia , are all my best friends .","of course , there are things that i will not tell my brothers like when i have sex or whatever , but i will tell them that i kissed a guy .",i tell nadia everything .,she is one of the closest people in my life .,it is hard to be in austin and away from most of them .,in san antonio i never worried about meeting other people because i had everything i needed in nadia and my family .,"now that i am in austin , it is hard to find friends .","i am , though , and actually like the people i hang out with , even though i do not see them all of the time .",i like going to live shows and now i have gone so much that i know people in bands and people that always go to see bands and it really is great .,"i do not really see them outside of this , but i am satisfied for now .",there was this guy that i liked named ben who is the lead singer for a band .,he is good looking and really is not my type at all .,i did need a change .,i needed to like someone who would make me feel ok and have fun and he was the perfect person to meet .,i went to europe this summer .,it was an experience and i went by myself which was great for me .,"i used to sometimes get lonely and hated to do things alone , but not anymore .",i finally have proved to myself that i can take care of myself and that it is ok to be alone .,"also , i learned that being alone and lonely are two separate things .",i go to live shows by myself because i am pretty sure that i will see someone i know there .,would i still go if i knew that i would not know anyone ?,i do not know .,i have not been put into that situation .,"anyway , so when i came back to austin i discovered that ben had a girlfriend and at first i did not want to like her .","but , i started talking to her and she is really nice and now i could not be happier for ben .","i figure that if something is supposed to happen then it will happen and if it is not , then there is no need worrying about it .",i think that ben and i had a little window of opportunity to get together before i left the country and it never happened and we missed our chance .,i think fate can only do so much and that she gives us the opportunities and if we take it then great and if we do not then it was not meant to be .,"these windows of opportunities may come again , but they may not .",there is no reason to wait for them to come because there are no certainties in life .,i am happy that ben has such a great girlfriend .,that is all i can do and just stay friends with him .,ben does have this cute friend named kevin who is also in a band .,"he is not the greatest band member , but boy !",is he a looker .,the first time i met kevin i had drank a lot and he was totally hitting on me .,"i did not take his advances because a ) nadia would not have wanted me to since i did not really know that guy b ) nadia was coming home with me , and c ) at the time i liked ben and wanted ben and not him .","i saw him later on ( after europe ) and let me tell you , i kicked myself for not at least kissing him .",he is so good looking !,every girl that sees him on stage all say the same thing whether they have a boyfriend or not .,"about 1 week ago , we went to this party and he was going to give me a ride home so we got dropped off at his house and just made out .","man , i wanted that guy .","we did not have sex , though , i can not figure out why .",i do not really know him and thought that since he was so good looking that he would be a little slut .,"i mean , i am sure that he was nice , but i was also sure that he was pretty experienced .","so , when he was taking me home he talked to me and seemed pretty nice and i was shocked .","it was a good shock , though .",i saw him later on and i wanted to finished what we started and he took a rain check because it was late and he had to work extremely early the next day .,one of his good friends told me great things about him and now i am interested .,"i do not want to start thinking that something serious is going to happen , but i can not dismiss that it may .",i just want to get to know him better and see if now is our window of opportunity .,"if it is not , then maybe i could get a good friend out of it .","either way , it is a win win situation .",as long as he does not ignore me in the future .,"i do not think he is like that , but i guess i always think the best of people .",we will see ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

this writing assignment is very interesting .,it is strange how it is somewhat difficult to simply write whatever i am thinking .,sometimes it is hard to tell .,i really need to catch up on some of my homework .,i also need to find a job .,high school was so much different than college is .,that is n't necessarily a bad thing .,just different .,i like living in austin .,there is much more to do than there is in a town of under 300 people .,i am hungry .,where should i eat lunch today .,my parents are coming down this weekend .,i think i 'll leave .,to many people in a little apartment .,i do n't really think i could handle it .,i got a cat .,well a kitten actually .,to keep my company .,it whines a lot .,and likes to crawl up my leg .,i have n't really talked to that many people from back home since i have been here .,but that does n't really bother me .,i need new people .,meeting people here is harder than i thought it would be .,i figured since this is a huge campus that it would be easy and just kind of happen .,but it turns out i think i might actually have to make an effort to meet new people .,i really need to find a job .,hopefully on-campus .,that would be great .,i am looking forward to psychology class today .,it is interesting .,i want to learn how people think .,because i wish i knew a lot of the time .,but i do n't really think that is something you can learn .,"because everyone 's mind works differently , so how can you learn how people think if it not the same with any one person ?",how can you know the emotions and thoughts of the people around you ?,i have a hard time knowing the thoughts and emotions of my closest friends .,and even myself at times .,the mind is so complex .,i have thought about majoring in psychology .,i just wish i had some clue as to what i want to do with my life .,"it 's like i am here , in college , finally , and i have no idea what to do with it .",i guess i will figure it out .,i just get tired of waiting for that sudden thought to just pop into my head and me know that is what i want to do for the rest of my life .,that 's a long time .,i want to do something i enjoy .,somewhere where i will be happy .,but i guess that is what everybody wants .,"but why do some people find that , and not others .",what makes the lucky ones different .,i guess if everyone did what the wanted then there would be nobody to do the dirty work .,but it just seems unfair that some have it so could .,and some can never find that place where they feel content .,does that place really exist ?,i think so .,i do n't think i have quite found it though .,i think i will though .,maybe i 'll be one of those lucky ones .,i miss jason .,is this going to work ?,do i want it to ?,i do but there are so many things to experience here .,will it change me ?,he thinks so .,but i do n't know .,maybe it will .,maybe it should .,but where does that leave us ?,is there an us ?,i have no idea how to handle that situation .,my parents are going crazy .,they miss me so much .,"i miss them , but am relieved to not be in there household anymore .",i needed some freedom .,i need to learn to live on my own .,i really do n't want a job though .,it will be hard to balance work and school and homework .,but i need to money .,i guess i have to eat and pay rent .,i am really getting hungry .,i am not really that tired considering i got up at 7 this morning .,surprising .,i have n't even taken a nap .,i do n't think i will .,i rode the shuttle from my apartment this morning .,i usually drive .,but i ca n't afford to pay $ 7 everyday .,it was n't that bad .,but i did n't really know where it was going to take me .,but i made it to class on time .,and did n't have to walk that far .,i just hope i am able to catch it this afternoon .,i think i know where it will pick me up .,but i do n't know what time it runs really .,and how late it runs .,but i should be done here around 5. cause i have a class from 3:30 till 5. i really need to go to the gym .,i think i am going to talk some dance classes .,that sounds like fun .,and i bet it will help me meet more people .,i need to talk to jason .,let him know i care and that i think about him a lot .,i know he worries .,i worry to .,i need to quit stressing about everything so much .,i worry myself to much .,i guess that is human nature though .,who knows what human nature really is .,maybe that is just an excuse for the way we act .,i know i use it as an excuse at times .,that 's kind of sad .,but i guess everyone probably does .,wow my times almost up .,that did n't seem like 20 minutes .,when you just start letting your thoughts go i guess time goes by pretty quickly .,i think i might take a nap .,but i have more homework that needs to be done .,dang there is so much

i wish travis would stop switching channels on the tv .,actually i wish my internet was hooked up already .,then i would n't have to be over here in his getto room .,granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help .,or maybe its just because he is a boy .,i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms .,but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm .,maybe my expectations are too high .,i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt ' be here at ut .,i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college .,so in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high .,it keeps me interested in whats going on .,"ok so travis is talking to the tv , now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me .",for a 19 year old i would n't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning .,i mean he was the validictorian of my class should n't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature ?,i dunno .,i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends .,im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him .,he does n't come off as the straightest guy you 've ever met .,infact he does n't come of as straight at all .,although he claims he only likes gals .,i do n't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out .,in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school .,he was n't good at it either but the school couldnt ' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they did n't let him in .,so they did .,but then when he was n't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really did n't go to his straightness accredation .,but i know one day he will just be like kendra im gay and i 'll be like i know its about time and then life will continue just as it always has .,ha reading rainbow is on .,i have n't watched that show in forever .,i did n't even know it was still showing .,i knew mr. rogers retired .,i grew up on that show .,i grew up on all of pbs .,i was really big into it and my younger brother just was n't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles .,he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs .,he didnt ' learn to read as fast either .,im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his alone time with mom .,but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he 's in high school too .,i think its just too funny .,now mom 's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she wo n't get bored .,i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i 've been locking the doors before i go to sleep .,i almost feel bad for him .,almost .,except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job .,i never asked for money like he does .,i ca n't understand where his money goes either .,he does n't go anywhere he ca n't drive .,but still he has no money ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,-0.600765 -0.226722 0.288198 0.0038 -0.012233 1.619162 -0.737244 -0.750137 -0.389211 0.189604 -0.155623 -0.303522 -0.299211 0.027207 -0.453259 0.0 -0.04277 0.819875 -1.285228 -0.795527 -1.570244 -0.525469 4.198267 -0.889702 0.381778 -0.386211 0.558637 -0.662075 -1.568163 -0.909687 -0.442314 -0.788316 -1.275466 -0.906028 -0.753383 -0.40643 -0.310686 -0.796767 -0.140781 0.298415 0.025301 0.385608 0.911598 0.34048 1.877563 -0.30229 -0.522178 1.9661 -0.610887 2.806531 0.30169 0.524043 0.188231 -1.071247 0.681365 0.586608 1.66016 -0.359539 0.251015 -0.433484 0.708121 -1.035766 -0.480161 -0.362261 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.058372 -1.297083 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.349664 -0.37208 0.064257 -0.422267 0.490649 -0.451544 -0.408772 -0.652694 5.174144 3.198047 5.023906 4.914641 4.824162,1665

myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me .,i just ca n't seem to let it go .,it might be because we were together for so long and go so close .,she was the best person god had ever put in my life .,"we seemed to click , it seemed so perfect , and she told me she felt the same .",she told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes .,she was scared .,she told me i meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her .,she had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me .,something she had n't let herself do with anyone else before me .,it felt so right .,"i was at such a high , life was so good .",i was happier than i had ever been .,i became so dependant on her for happiness .,"i know that is something that was unhealthy , but she had gotten just as dependant on me .",we had so many plans for the future .,we planned out every step of the way .,factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school .,"everyone is telling me to move on , but she told me before she

what it looked like .,i blew up on her .,it was a normal reaction .,"everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring , and then bang , everything comes crashing down .",everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there .,and i completely defended her .,"cause i knew her better than anyone else , not only my thoughts but hers as well .",she was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past .,"every male figure in her past had let her down , and she could n't comprehend someone loving her as much as i did .","so because all the idiots in her past , i have to be let go because she ca n't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together .","why did she have to go , we were happy .",i do n't know what happened at camp .,it was more than seven weeks ago that i talked to her .,i called this week and left a message she did n't return .,i called again today .,she picked up we talked for 18 minutes and 36 seconds .,"she seems perfectly happy ,

yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with .,one interesting part to me is the occipital lobe .,"three years ago i was in a car accident , which i have fully recovered from , expect i have blurred vision in my right eye .",within a few months after the accident i went to many doctors to see what the problem was .,one doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight .,he said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened .,he also said that i would never regain my eyesight in that eye .,"now that it 's three years later , there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process .",another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain .,he told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things .,sometimes during the semester i may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional 's opinion .,i do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so i would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,2.675604 -0.981797 -0.731167 -1.450951 -1.690958 0.685268 1.83271 2.05328 2.013065 -1.556042 -0.041288 -0.590446 1.350036 0.134814 0.972329 0.0 -0.04277 -1.537737 -1.568616 -0.177929 -1.702927 1.057647 -0.438612 2.104294 -0.624052 1.560016 0.100062 0.556156 -2.275126 -1.926924 -1.100231 -0.542118 -1.607395 -0.906028 -1.017959 -0.137121 2.484057 -0.010663 1.347882 2.369178 0.432974 -0.843916 -0.164781 4.091262 6.887166 1.888542 -1.093488 -0.679029 0.96407 -0.219456 -1.34699 1.139814 2.403227 -0.312869 0.495807 -2.278415 -2.123839 -0.954251 0.199357 0.99712 -1.376454 1.52227 -0.480161 -0.745201 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -0.776762 -0.804453 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.37208 -0.337085 -0.422267 -1.214076 -0.451544 -0.408772 -1.572655 3.782127 3.383669 4.191562 4.517408 5.252101,1126
"today is september 10 , the day before our new monumental rememberence day of september 11th .",i sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the united states .,it is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we ca n't do anything about it .,i still remember like it was yesterday watching the september 11th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the united states .,i really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow .,now that i am a freshman at the university of texas things are beginging to change .,"for instance , my boyfriend and i are on a break , whatever that means .",he does n't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out .,he 's a junior at st. edwards university and has done the whole new college experience already .,it is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer .,i think it is that i really want to go out and meet new people .,"getting to know the girls at my dorm in kinsolving is really fun , and i like hanging out with them on the weekends .","of course this means going to parties with other boys there , and this does n't make my boyfriend very happy .","i can totally understand because i wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party , but i have to do the whole college experience right ?","well anyway now that we are broken up , i realize how much i miss him and how much i do n't want to end things .",it 's weird how when it 's time to go to sleep or study that is all i can think about .,"he 's so cute and perfect , i do n't know what i am screwing up .",it 's hard trying to balance your time here now that i am in college .,"there is always something to do , and i love that , but i need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track .","i guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult , and deadlines were not so final , as long as you could persuade the teacher .",college is a blast and i love my roomate .,she went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to baton rouge .,she still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could .,so then she made the right choice and came to ut and we ended up rooming together .,it 's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 1 in the morning to 2 in the morning .,"i really need to go to the gym today also because i do n't want to gain the freshman 15 , i reallly do n't want to go back home to lake jackson looking like a heffer !",so anyway i think i might go run after i finish writing .,another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here .,she got in to the summer ut program but decided to go to lsu instead .,"i miss her so much , we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close .",our boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time .,"me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up , so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly .",except now we 're having problems and we 're in the same town .,"my friend and her boyfriend are 8 hours away and doing great , funny how that works .",one good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty .,i love the hills and trees .,outside my dorm room window is hills and churches .,"yes , it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home .",another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 21 goes to swt so is only like 30 minutes away from me .,we have always been so close and i miss her lots .,i went down on laybor day with 3 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters .,it was really fun and i got to spend time with her .,"my mom is sad that i left for college , she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college .",i really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind .,all of my friends were leaving for school and i really didnt wnat to be the only one at home .,i am one out of four kids at home .,"my older sister is already off at swt , but then i have a 15 year old brother and a 11 year old sister .",i do n't think it is the same at home without me .,"my mom and i are really close , and i talk to her almost everyday .","she said it 's very quiet without me at home , i guess i was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around .","even though not being at home

i just got home from a friend 's apartment today .,as of right now i have so many thoughts going through my mind .,i have a hard decision coming up to make .,it is if i want to join a soroity or not .,one of my really good friends is going to rush this semester .,i 'm not sure if i want to do if she is going to at the same time .,i 'm not sure it is the right thing to do together .,"however , i 'm still tempted to do it .",the question is if it is right for me .,my parents would both flip out if they found out i wanted to do it .,when they hear the word soroity they automatically think drinking and drugs .,however i have met many people in different soroity 's and they are all really good people .,many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl .,all of the ones i have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person .,one of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways .,"i remember her back in high school , and compared to now she is much more confident .",there are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most .,i really do n't know what to do .,it 's all up in the air for now .,i should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think .,"i 'm trying to collect opinions , but they have all been negative so far .",those negative opinions prolong my decision making .,i figure if i do it then i have to do it now or i never will .,the bad part is that i want no regrets later .,i do n't want to look back and say i wish i had done that .,"i 've made that mistake before and , do n't want to do it time and again .",i think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well .,i know there are volunteer groups out there .,i love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people .,another one of my concerns is the time consumption .,i know if i do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing .,i 'm not sure if i can handle that or not .,plus i do n't take rejection very well either .,"so i 'd rather not risk it , but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process .",guess decisions will be made at a later time when i have more information about everything .,right now i like the college life that i 'm living .,i 've met great people .,my only complaint is about my room .,it 's so cold in here that i 'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over .,i ca n't feel my hands and i have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time .,i doubt anyone can do to much about it .,it 's only been ten minutes since i started this assignment .,i feel like it 's been the full twenty .,another thing i do n't like about my floor here in jester is the fighting over the washing machines .,for awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor .,i 'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done .,"now we have three but they always seem to be busy , and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing .",as if no one else needed the machines .,i swear sometimes i think i 'm never going to have clean clothes again .,i bought more socks just in case i did n't get clean ones for a long time .,"sadly , i 've only been here two weeks in austin and i 've already been to the highland mall three times .",each time i really have no idea why my friends and i went .,only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately .,all it was a white shirt for a party .,the traffic down here gets on my nerves .,i think austin has the worst highway system in the world .,how could someone construct such an awful system ?,do n't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in .,i think i 've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks .,it 's crazy .,it 's so hard to get around .,just simply trying to get to a walmart is a pain .,thankfully i do n't have to go that often .,ever since i got to austin i my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off .,i sleep at such random hours sometimes .,i 'm suprised i 'm not sick yet .,with the cold room and the funky sleeping times .,oh well it 's the price you pay to be at ut .,i 'm so scared that i 'm not going to do well in my classes .,i 'm not the worlds greatest test taker .,since all of my classes are based on tests i 'm worried .,i concentrate and pay attention but i know that 's not enough to make it .,my study habits are bad too .,i need to get some new ones really quick !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'm really use to writing for long periods of time straight and not stop .,i keep a little diary myself and write my thoughts and feelings down whenever they overwhelm me .,i suppose it 's some sort of stress release because i always feel better afterwards .,writing in my diary has allowed me to express my feelings and emotions onto paper .,"this way , it 's easy for me to look at it and then maybe figure out how i am to deal with the emotions .",some things i write about are problems with my relationships with other people .,one entry i wrote just recently was about a problem with this guy .,there was just so much pressure on me from this guy that liked me that i could n't really stand it anymore .,"he told me he liked me , and i suppose he expected me to just like him back .","do n't get me wrong , he is a good friend of mine .",maybe that 's why it was so hard .,"but anyways , i was able to express my contained feelings into my diary .",it really did help a lot .,"when i first heard of this assignment on writing for 20 minutes straight without stopping i thought to myself `` wow , this will be fun '' .","my roommate , on the other hand groaned and said she would never be able to do something like that .",she says there 's just not that much to write about .,i told her how she could just write bout her day or whatever .,20 minutes goes by pretty quickly if you think about it .,it 's already been about 5 minutes since i started .,i 'm typing kind of fast .,i suppose it 's the flow of the words .,"since there 's no really structure on this assignment , i can write without thinking too much .",i had a pretty harsh day today .,"did n't set my alarm clock , thus i woke up 10 minutes before my first class started .",and my teacher is a real stickler for this timing thing .,she wants us in our seats and ready to go by the time class starts .,"that is usually what i would do , but today , i really could n't do much about that .",i hate walking into class late .,there 's only about 500 zillion people that look at you when you walk in .,"and you know what they 're thinking , `` man , she 's late '' .",i do n't like that feeling .,well after the lecture ( which i understood very well ) i had to go back home because i had n't brushed my teeth or anything yet .,"the whole way back i was thinking , `` man .",it 's too early in the year to be starting this '' .,but i got over it .,told my friends and laughed at it for a little bit .,that 's one of the reasons i love having my old friends here at ut .,there 's always someone there for you .,it 's like bringing a little bit of home with you .,i live with one of my old friends from high school and she 's an awesome roommate .,her boyfriend is also one of my good friends .,and his roommate is the guy that i mentioned earlier .,that likes me .,"then i have many other old friends that are hear with me , and it just makes me feel more safe and comfortable .",but i know i need to make other friends and i do .,i like to just talk to people i do n't know .,you know that old rule `` never talk to strangers ?,"'' well , i do n't follow that one too well .",it 's always nice to meet new people .,they can always share new things with you that you could n't get if you just stayed with your comfort zone .,i like to venture out and make friends and do new things .,"people that do n't like to do that , i feel , are too closed and unwilling to experiment and find out .",it 's scary being here .,a brand new place with all these huge buildings towering above .,scattering around like ants looking for classes .,"in houston , we have big buildings and classes too , but , everything is so familiar there .","i miss it , but i would n't want to be anywhere but here right now .",i love the new atmosphere and environment ut provides .,there are so many things to do .,i 'm enjoying it a lot .,maybe that 's why i do n't really feel a whole lot of stress with the new classes and deadlines and everything .,i guess in happy here and that 's what 's most important to me .,all the other things i can deal with as long as i 'm feeling good ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"as i start my third semester at ut , i feel both excited and a little overwhelmed at once .","first of all , i 'm excited because this is probably the first semester that i feel truly comfortable with my life here .",i am living with my sister which is so good for me .,we get along really well and i really enjoy spending as much time with her as i can .,"also , my exboyfriend is at ut with me now .",he is now one of my best friends and it means so much to me that we are able to spend so much time together now .,but fortunately the time that we did not spend together last year ( because he was still in high school ) was good for me as well .,it enabled me to find out who i was before and become a more independent person before he came to join me here at ut .,"because of our time apart , i made lots of new friends and was able to have a lot of fun even without him .","so , this year , i not only have him with me , but i also have all the friends that i made last year so that i do n't depend only on him .","my best friend , unfortunately is not in such a good situation .","her boyfriend came to ut this year as well , but because he was away from her last year , she spent very little time at ut meeting new people and getting to know the campus and the city .",she spent most of her time in houston visiting him .,"as a result , this year , she spends all of her time with her boyfriend and associates with very few other people .","although , i know that she 's really happy right now that her boyfriend is here with her , i realize that if something happens to her relationship with him , she will be left with very few friends to turn to .","since she made such little effort last semester to develop such friendships , i fear that she will feel really isolated if she is left without him .",she barely even talks to me much anymore because she is so involved with him .,"but i try to hold this against her because i know that she is not trying to ignore me , but she just really enjoys spending time with her boyfriend .","but other than that , i 'm really happy with my social situation right now .","it is a really good thing that i have this support of all my friends at this time , because i realize that this is probably going to be one of the hardest semesters of my college career .",i am taking 4 architecture classes in addition to this psychology class .,"three of these classes involves building models , drawing orthographics , and designing .",two of them involve large amounts of reading and writing papers .,"in the first week , i already am swamped .","although i know myself well enough to know that i will definitely finish all my projects , somehow i still stress out about them a bit , just thinking of all the work that they will involve and worrying about how many latenighters i will have to pull ( especially",when i think of the fact that i have 8:00 classes every day of the week !,) .,and i would love to work this semester to earn some money to pay for all the projects that i will have to build because i know how expensive they get .,"but , i realize that with the huge load i have so far , working is almost impossible for me .","if i could have my way though , i would work at a restaurant in town .",i worked at pappasito 's over the summer and i really loved waiting tables .,i met so many great friends and it was fun meeting new guests and serving them .,i think the reason i loved it so much was definitely because of all the people i met .,there were mostly guys that i worked with and they were all so friendly to me .,we would always talk during the shifts and then go out for drinks after work .,i got to know lots of them very well and even dated one for sure .,it was really great meeting people that in

home also .",i hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend .,it would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves .,seeing him makes me miss him more but i guess i

of any importance to him .,i do n't believe him when he says that .,i wonder if he is as committed as he says he is .,i am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through .,i hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen ?,i wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long .,i think i 'd be the one to

walked all that way to jester for nothing .,i 'm sure if i got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be .,why am i assuming that

what does the drug ecstasy do to the brain ?,i have been very curious about this for some time now .,maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug .,the reason why i am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it .,"in fact , in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school , it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic !",several of my friends have done it up to 11 or 12 times already !,i have n't tried it since i refuse to do drugs but i 'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does .,"apparently , when on ecstasy , it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect .","music is everything and once listening , someone who is rolling ( the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking x ) ca n't pull away .","also , they say they feel as if they have `` lungs of steel '' in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they ca n't stop .","oh , and the mouth chewing .",why does that happen ?,"their mouths jitter while they 're rolling and after the drug wears off , their mouths hurt or feel sore .",that 's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party .,"well , first of all they 're sweating profusely and also they 're chewing lots and lots of gum !",its crazy actually .,i went to a rave with my friends last saturday .,it was at austin music hall .,"at least 70 % of the people attending the rave was rolling on x. well , essentially , that 's what rave 's are for .","its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people , the majority of whom is xing like crazy !","anyway , my friends had a blast there .",of course they were rolling .,"i had fun too , but not nearly as much i imagine !","in fact , it was 3:30 in the morning , we had been dancing for at least 4 hours straight , and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired .",does n't this sound crazy ?,what does the drug do to people ?,"have any severe , longlasting consequences been discovered for sure .","i 've been told several theories , some of which include the brain bleeding , there being permanent damage on the spine , memory loss , and brain cells being killed .",sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with .,"if it were n't an illegal drug , i 'd definitely try it ( provided it did n't totally screw me up in the future !",) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is .,and not just word of mouth .,i 've seen people on it countless times .,they look as if they could die happy right then and there !,i do n't know if you 're planning on discussing anything like this in class but i 'm really interested in finding out more about x. just out of curiosity !,"well , i think i 'd like to talk about something remotely related .","one of the guys whom i 'm talking about , in fact , he 's in this class with me , is named j. i went to high school with him but we were never friends .","we hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally , but we barely even talked to each other .",well he and his friend are living at towers together and since we 're all down here together we 've been hanging out a lot .,"a whole lot , in fact .","and i was n't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave , a lot of people stayed the night at their place , including me , and we kind of `` hooked up. `` now , ever since then , we 've kind of","been messing around well , nothing much .","the thing is , we have n't mentioned it to each other at all .",we keep doing it but do n't discuss it .,so i 'm not sure what the deal is .,i think i like him .,"well , actually , yes i do like him .",the problem is .,does he like me ?,i ca n't tell either way .,"i mean , he 's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me does n't mean much .",he could hate my guts for all i know and still be doing what he 's doing just to get some !,that would really suck .,"and i do n't want to ask him because , well for one , i would n't know what to say .","and for two , i 'm scared of the answer .",that would just be awful if i spill my guts and he totally cops out .,"and what 's worse is if that happens , not only are we in this class together , but we have to go to the same school for the next four years !",what should i do ?,i do n't know .,"i hope something happens soon that 'll figure this out for me well , something good that is !",i 've written a lot more than twenty minutes so i should probably go now .,i guess this was n't as hard as i thought it would be .,whew !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i 'm starting to feel tired and lazy .,that sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now i feel really comfortable as i sit in this chair and look at the screen .,i feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed .,i feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down .,i 'm thinking about going to gregory but i feel so relaxed that i probably wo n't go .,its such a long walk and then i have to come back to my room before i go to another class .,"i wish my dorm room was closer to gregory , then i think i would go more often .",instead i always tell myself i 'm going to go but most of the time i just put it off .,"my back is sore and i think i need to stretch it , my legs are also sore .",i know it has to be from all the walking in between classes .,i ca n't wait for tonight .,monday night football .,my night to sit on the couch and watch tv .,i wonder who is playing .,"i think its the eagles and bucaneers , but i 'm not sure .",i think the bucaneers have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year .,i know for sure the cowboys are going to be bad .,they will finish around 6 to 7 wins .,"if they win more , it will be a successful year for them .",i wonder where my roommate is .,"he always leaves the lights on in our room , so i know he has been home and left already .",i really wish i was done for the rest of the day and did n't have another class .,i would definitely take a nap .,naps are so key .,they are rejuvenating beyond anything else .,my hair is always in my eyes .,i think its time for me to finally get it cut .,"its annoying now , its too hot to have long hair in my face .",also it looks kind of shaggy .,i 'm taking my shoes off .,that feels better .,ooh .,that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad .,ill have to put another band aide on it .,i need to start playing basketball more so i wo n't get blisters when i just play on occasions .,"the only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play , so i never get the chance to practice my shot .",so in the games i end up missing most of the time .,fortunately the competition is not real high at gregory .,although i have seen brian boddicker and sidwell harris up there at times .,i ca n't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that .,what if they got hurt ?,he would be infuriated .,how would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game .,does not sound right .,"you know what else is not right , chance mock starting t quarterback .",texas 's offense is so predictable with chance at qb .,run cedrick benson up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it .,that is when chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it .,"on the other hand when vince young is at qb , you ca n't predict what is going to happen .",he is much more of a threat .,"he can run , scramble , elude tacklers and throw also , at least that is what he did against new mexico st. i know its the aggies of new mexico st. that we played last week but he did better than chance mock against the same guys .",so i think he deserves the start against arkansas this upcoming week .,i ca n't wait to rub it into mic 's face when we beat them .,i hope he finds a ticket and can come down from arkansas for the game .,he will definitely be intimidated by the texas crowd .,how long has it been since i have done my laundry ?,not since i left home i think .,i really do n't want to do laundry in my dorm room .,it takes too long .,i think i 'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever i go home .,"probably around homecoming , which is the same weekend as the texas ou game .",i ca n't believe i did n't get a ticket for that .,that really pisses me off .,"i did get lucky though with my season tickets , section 20 row 7 , right behind the cannon .",that was a pretty good draw for a freshman .,"still , ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the texas ou game .",best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else mack brown should be fired .,that would be the fourth year in a row .,he can recruit like its nobody 's business but he ca n't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game .,straight up he gets out coached every time by bob stoops .,what a stud .,my fingers are getting a little tired from typing ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

wow this is actually a cool writing assignment .,i would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what i am thinking for a 20 minute period .,i have just gotten back from a meeting about the texas lonestars organization and loved it !,the only problem is that i am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing .,i am kind of stressed out ( but not nearly as bad as i know i can get sometimes ) just because i am pre med and i know that i really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved .,"getting involved , however has never been a problem for me .",i love to be involved in everything .,now that is a problem because if i spread myself too thin i am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue .,i know for sure that i want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions .,i am going to try out for the roustabouts and the steel dance company .,i am beginning to get nervous just because i have n't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since i 've been away from home .,i hope that i am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience .,"i know that i am here to get an education , but it 's obvious to everyone that college does n't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career , but it 's also a learning experience for life lessons .",i feel that just in the week and a half that i have been here i have already become more responsible and determined .,"it has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new , huge city , but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of `` yey school is over '' to `` wow , my life is just beginning , along with lots of studying",that i do n't really want to do. `` my life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway .,i know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has .,the fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like i do n't belong .,"yet , the funny thing is that i do n't really care or maybe it 's that i do n't know how to make the effort to fit in again .",my first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that i 've lived in for the past four years ( even though i lived there when i was younger ) and i feel like it will just be weird to see how my family,'s lives have just king of carried on without me .,i wo n't really understand my mom 's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school .,my dad is perhaps the only one that i will probably still feel just about the same with because i am use to not seeing him all the time .,"my time is almost up and as of right now i am just really hoping that , even though i may not be showing my priority to god right now , he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,0,0.943655 -1.528259 -0.536784 -1.527905 -1.752271 0.957112 0.808245 1.095372 0.949812 -0.185274 0.042186 -0.590446 -0.082698 0.700096 1.073924 0.0 -0.04277 -0.858222 0.04414 -0.795527 -0.167658 0.514464 -1.143261 0.363079 -0.624052 0.306002 0.525871 -0.087077 -0.331426 0.792556 1.187166 1.175511 -1.32961 -0.00407 -1.017959 -1.109326 -0.574216 0.497224 0.236374 -0.896287 0.194384 1.440656 -0.207481 -0.683002 -0.384274 -1.255159 0.8928 -0.987219 -0.885271 -1.019498 -1.074037 -0.135884 -0.113778 0.105978 1.05986 -0.363737 -0.66207 -0.265035 0.814354 0.812461 -0.05141 0.362019 0.007534 1.029972 -0.546834 -0.280398 -0.086094 -1.150375 -0.582382 -0.073676 -0.23436 -0.607823 -0.168945 -0.337085 1.090014 -0.32353 1.524696 0.175065 -1.076243 4.867466 3.945126 4.562198 4.969436 4.428089,2357
"well , i 'm here in san antonio visiting ty .",i love it here .,i wish i did n't have to go back to school on monday .,"ut 's fun , but everything reminds me of how alone i am .",i feel loved here .,"even if there is n't a constant stream of people through the room here , like at ut , i 'm entertained and happy .",i think that the people coming through my room at the dorm is the only thing keeping me from breaking down and crying .,"i do n't know how i 'm going to get through a semester , much less a year , or even 4 years .","i do n't have depression ( at least i do n't think so ) , i think it 's just the pressures of school .",everyone says it gets better after the first semester .,i hope that happens .,on another topic .,ty has downloaded some great guitar music .,i love it .,i 'm going to burn a copy before i go back to austin .,he 's working on his homework right now .,"i never realized how much i would miss him , even though we 're only an hour and a half away .",he 's the only person who i trust enough to be myself around .,"and he loves me anyways , which is really the part i ca n't believe .",i ca n't wait until next year when he 's at ut with me .,i should call my mom sometime .,"i 've been home once , for a few hours , but really i have n't talked to my parents all that much .","i guess that 's okay , and honestly , i do n't miss them much .",they got me to a point of being pretty self-sufficient awhile back i think .,"sometimes though , it sucks , because i want help , but they wo n't give it to me .",i guess it has made me a stronger person .,ty wants me to help him with his physics homework .,"i had to remind him that i 'm a business major , and that i nearly failed physics in high school .",he makes me laugh .,he 'll make a wonderful engineer someday .,so gifted in math and science .,i wish i had his math logic .,"unfortunately for me , i do n't .",calculus is going to kill me this semester .,there are pretty posters on ty 's walls .,there 's a gorgeous one of saturn and 6 of it 's moons .,"i do n't remember , does saturn have more than 6 moons ?",i really want a dr. pepper .,i have n't had any caffiene today because there is n't any in this apartment .,"i guess i 'm kind of getting a headache from the lack of caffiene , but i 'll live .",we 're going to go grocery shopping and get food soon .,i ca n't believe it 's only been 13 minutes .,i 've typed a crapload of stuff .,"as much as i 'm dreading ' not enjoying school , i do have to say i 'm happy with most of my classes .",just getting professors that are fluent in english is quite an accomplishment these days it seems .,"i wish the cut on my foot would heal up , it really hurts .",my favorite color is green .,i just realized that i packed all green shirts for this weekend .,and i think about half of the shirts i own are some variance on a shade of green .,and i do n't consciously buy green .,analyze that .,"well , the roadrunner man is coming this week to give us cable internet in our dorm room , so at least i 'll be able to see ty on the webcam from now on .","that 's actually exciting , because the internet access in my dorm room sucks .","wow , i 'm a dork .",i think ty 's dorkiness has rubbed off on me .,"god , i 've even started liking star trek .",that 's probably a sign that i 'm officially a nerd .,"all these girls in my dorm rushed for sororities , and i realized last week that i have nothing in common with them other than we are in the same species .",and even that is questionable .,they all spew off these greek letters and i 'm completely clueless about who or what they 're talking about .,one of those situations that it 's best to just smile and nod .,and living on the 26th floor of the dorm is such a pain in the ass .,having to wait a good 10 minutes for an elevator to take you down every morning .,being the last to get off of a crowded un-airconditioned elevator .,"we have a great view , but i do n't think that the hassle is worth it .",i need a new stereo to compete with my next-door neighbor 's guitar amp .,"he ca n't really play guitar very well either , so maybe i should just invest in some good noise blocking headphones .",or earplugs .,earplugs are probably the cheaper option here .,oh the joys of dorm life .,time 's almost up !, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty- ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever- if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine,with me .,i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow- the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week .,"i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a , little more hard core than its been .",i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good- the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something .,this keyboard is so weird to type on- im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something- i do n't know what is so weird about it .,i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union- its pretty annoying- so i had to get wendy 's which is good but its not what i wanted .,when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea- the sweet tea in the south is so good- and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in,it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw .,i do n't even know if you can order sweet tea down here- i havent tried but i doubt it .,you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way .,now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something .,i think my cd is over now .,no its not .,i do n't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying .,oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd .,my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one .,maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one .,i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something .,oh well she can live .,im really tired and its only like 9:45. probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning .,this song is definitely the best on this cd .,i love dave matthews- i 've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome .,ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then .,that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there .,not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway .,it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore- now it smells like air freshener .,i wonder who thought of making up air fresheners- its so random .,is this supposed to be in complete sentences and with good punctuation or anything ?,i do n't think so- so oh well .,my knee hurts .,i think i should ice it or soemthing but i do n't have an ice pack .,i guess ill have to get that sometime .,an ice pack and sweet tea .,if i wasnt typing right now i would write that down somewhere but hopefully ill remember it later .,this song sucks and im thirsty now becasue i was thinking about sweet tea .,you ca n't even order sweet tea in the north because they look at you like youre retarded and then theyre like um are you retarded and then youre like no give me iced tea and some sugar packets but im not going to be ahppy because its going tp,be nasty .,i could go for some pizza- liek the good stuff you can get in real pizzerias- is that how you spell pizzeria ?,i guess it doesnt matter .,i miss the italian food from up there so much .,i ca n't wait to go home for christmas just because the food is so good up there .,not taht the food isnt good down here- its just all mexican or tex-mex or barbeque adn who can live off of that all the time ?,i need more pasta .,penne ala vodka is possibly the best food ever created .,i think ifigured out the problem- im too short for this desk or something .,you have to be like really tall to sit here and type forever because if youre not then you start getting all pissed off because its weird to type here .,or maybe its just me .,i doubt it .,ill have to ask emily what she thinks at the end of this thing because i swear this is just a weird position to be in .,hmm .,im thinking about getting some phone books to sit on or something .,haha how funny would that be ?,and im not even abnormally short or anything- its just weird to be here like this ., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

could n't find anything and was just walking around in circles , and the manager said to","me , `` wake up , '' and i got so upset , i thought it was such an insult and after work i went home and cried because i knew i would have to deal with that for the rest of my life .","my mind sometimes just leaves my head , and i ca n't think or concentrate , even on what i 'm saying .","i 'll be in the middle of a sentence and then just get tired of what i 'm saying and just stop and say , `` you know , whatever. `` i meet someone and ask them their name , but then do n't listen for the answer , so","i never remember anyone 's name and i forget things that have just happened , and i know that it 's going to last forever , because my mom has it , my grandmother has it , and my cousin is the worst .","my cousin was diagnosed with bipolar disease and she was on something , i think it was prozac , and she had lots and lots of problems taking it .","she 's a lot better about taking it now , but when she does n't , her `` cluelessness '' kicks in worse than ever .",so i think the cluelessness is tied into something greater that 's a problem with me .,"my parents are completely against medicine and think it 's against christianity , but i wish my whole family was on medicine .",my brother and i both have anxiety attacks sometimes and my mom and dad are just crazy .,"my mom plays this nice , wonderful housewife that loves everyone and everything , but then she 'll go crazy and do things like try and run away for a while and tell me that she almost threw everything from my floor out the window .",it is completely like a scene out of the movie american beauty .,"i 've been brought up thinking that you can have your emotions and that you 're entitled to your emotions , but they are n't a public thing .",so i used to go into my room and just flip out and cry and fall to the ground and silently scream and they never knew anything was wrong .,"so when i went to rhode island last summer , i was completely messed up .","i was living in a dorm with someone , because i was at a summer school kind of thing for art , and so i could n't get away and cry ; there were always people there .","i would get my lunch and try to eat with everyone , but i would start to take the first bite and then just start crying because i wanted to go home .","i called home all the time and said i thought if i stayed that i was going to die , and i really thought i was going to .","well , unfortunately my 20 minutes is up , so i ca n't talk anymore , but i have about 3 more hours of things to say , if not three weeks .", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"You can't tell a person to write their feelings and expect that to show their thought processes. The awareness of the exercise takes away the naturalness of thought and the process of transcribing one's thoughts is inexact anyway. Well, I'm having difficulty doing it anyway. My apartment sucks. It's so modern. The clubhouse is littered with """"artistic"""" wrought-iron chairs and bright paint and triangular windows and shit. There's nothing artistic about that-- it means nothing to the creator and it's just used to entice """"hip"""" college kids to waste their money on these glossed-over crack house apartments. I'm not too upset about it though. I'm used to that sort of thing from corporate entities. The hard thing about these exercises is the difficulty of knowing the audience. It's not to the professor or the TA or my classmates or even to me because, I'm thinking it, why do I need to tell it to myself?  I write this and click the submit button and it travels into some ethereal world where it is represented to the prof / TA / whoever as an affirmative for social security number 465953267. Maybe that makes this more / less daring. I don't have to worry about you(whoever you are) reading it, and more importantly about myself going back and reading it tomorrow or in a week or a month or whenever. It makes it more daring because I can write anything and as soon as I click submit, it vanishes as far as anyone is concerned. Less daring in that I risk nothing. I'm wondering about the symbolic value of that word submit. I submit my thoughts. Earlier I was thinking about something. It was a little fragment of a story about existentialism in a Borgesian dream format. Maybe I'll develop that now. I dreamt last night that I was a mercenary in far away world where I had no vested interest in the goings-on. The denizens of said world were warring over things of grave importance. I posed the following question to myself: """"If I were to care about a side which would it be?""""  And so I picked a side and started fighting. Without fervor, without life-and-death importance, but with respect and a little curiosity. Not too bad. I'm not much of a writer. I guess as 20 minutes pass one begins to get used to the audience and just write. I'm out of ammo.   ",0
"what am I supposed to write about?  I can't type right. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow. I need to wash my clothes and do all my homework. Those Rugby Little Sisters are strange girls and they have weird parties. Where's Ashley? My roommate is talking to me. She says I need to keep some of my thoughts to myself. I guess maybe that's true. I don't want to do homework. I just want to go to the football game this weekend and not have to worry about grades. I hope that freaky guy isn't going to be at the party on Saturday. He might try something on me again. I like this song, it makes me think of going to Houston. I don't like my Biology 211 professor, she doesn't teach very well and I don't know how I'm supposed to pass her damn class if she keeps jumping around the book and not lecturing about what she needs to lecture about. She is too disorganized. I really need to wash my clothes and I need to workout tomorrow. My foot hurts, though. I really don't feel like running 10 miles tomorrow. That sucks. I wonder what Brendan's doing. Probably drinking. I can't wait to go home next month. It's funny, I'm not homesick, but I'm excited to go home. I want to go to Europe. I kind of want to go to Spain. I want to go everywhere. Wow, it's thundering a lot. I hope it doesn't rain on Saturday. I don't really feel like going to the rugby game tomorrow. I really need to study SOMETIME this weekend. sometime other than sunday. I'm so sleepy. I'm sleeping in tomorrow since I don't have class. I'm thirsty. I need to go buy more Diet Dr. Pepper. There just aren't enough hours in a day. I'm mad at John. He still hasn't called me and he didn't even say goodbye to me. I thought he was more of a friend than that. Apparently not. Yuck. I need to wash my face and brush my teeth. I feel icky. That girl is STILL on the phone. And she probably wonders why she feels so homesick. Well, maybe if she had get off the phone she would actually have a life here. Being on the phone isn't going to help her at all. She is kind of bitchy too. She is just not friendly at all. Whatever. I hope Aryan's doing okay. Maybe I should call him. It's too late at home, though. Never mind. I have no idea what I want. I just can't let all my exes go. Maybe it's because I'm too immature or something. That's why I needed to get out of Knoxville, so I could decide what I want with life. Here comes Ashley. Okay. I'm sick of the bathrooms here. I want my own bathroom. I hate it. The water here kind of smells funky too. I guess I'm used to more chlorinated water. I need to call Joe and Stefanie. I hope they get married. Rebecca's wedding is on Saturday. Wow. She is only 21. I can't imagine being married in two years. That's way too soon. My hair color is awful. I want to go back to that salon and get that bastard to fix it. I mean, I spent a lot of money on crap. I should have told him right off that I hate it. I should be more confrontational. I have that issue. I need to fill up my water filter. I really want something to drink. Good. Only like five more minutes of this. My right shoulder has been hurting lately. It feels as if my vein or artery or whatever is going to burst. I need to get my meningitis vaccination. There's so much to do and I just don't have time to do it. That tickled. Oh! Virgo! That's me. What am I going to do next week for my birthday?  Who is Beau?  Uh oh. ",0
"I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 5 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading """"Reader friendly material""""  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 69 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in Illinois)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 12th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. Tim just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! ",1
"I am in Mollie's room right now using her internet-I hope she doesn't care. I get really frustrated with computes sometimes. I wish I understood them better. I only like Email. I like Email because I can talk to my friends in New York. I can't wait until I get to see them on my birthday. I hope they are just as excited as I am. Meg is talking about her boyfriend. Everyone has a boyfriend here in Hardin House. Alot of them are far away though. I guess that would be pretty hard to deal with. If I really liked someone far away I would be really sad here. Last night was really fun. I had a good time with my friends. Sixth street is always fun because there are such a variety of people there. One of these nights I am going to sing karyoke. Then maybe someone will discover me and I'll become famous. I think my friend Rob will be famous someday. Je and Andy and Frederick. They are so awesome--I can't wait to see them. I wonder what will happen with Andy. I keep wondering about him. He has a girlfriend, but she is depressed and she brings him down. Maybe I'll learn more about her depression in this class. I just hope he's happy. Rob is not happy with Amy right now--she really lied to him and Caleb. They are trying to get revenge now. They wrote a letter about her and they are going to put it up in the restaurant where she works. It's pretty mean and I bet she'll be really embarrassed. I told Rob that revenge is a scary thing because it can consume you. He said """"I know, but I've never been so furious in my life. """" I feel sorry for him because I know he really liked her. I warned him though. I knew the second I met her that she was up to no good. She came between two best friends and she didn't even care. I wonder how my friends at schools far away are doing. I think Abby, at Arizona is doing really well. She has made two """"soul-mates"""" from Las Vegas. I bet they are so crazy on the dance floor! I miss Abby--especially dancing with her. She is so much fun. I guess I'll see her on OU weekend. Then I can tell her all about my trip to New York. Kelli will be home from Georgia, too. I can't wait to see her either. I hope she's been behaving herself. She breaks a lot of hearts. Her mom is really lonely by herself, I know she can't wait for Kelli to come home. I bet their phone bill is very expensive. I hope mine is not too bad. I've talked to Rob and Andy several times. I'm so glad I talked to Andy though. We really confessed a lot to each other, It was good to get some of those things off of my chest. The situation is pretty good right now, I hope Rob doesn't make the situation worse--if he is a real friend he will encourage Andy like he said he would. I think my friend Dallas in Arizona is miserable. He has never really been his own person-- he relies too much on other people for his identity and now he knows no one a t school, He will really grow from this experience though. I should call him, but then again ===That phone bill! That (the save in $) is the good thing about Email. I can always send him regular mail, too. I like real mail. You can write your true feelings so much easier in a letter. That is why I like to write Andy, ",1
"The jumbled mess in my head goes on and confusion takes over. Sorting out feeling from feeling and sensation from sensation leaves me with a fatigue which overwhelms me with each passing day. Not totally sure of where to go or what to do, I feel as if I wander aimlessly amongst all the people. things pop into my mind, and they are the importances of certain classes, such as the tests coming up, and all the studying I still need to do. I think more about this until it consumes me, and then outcomes that might not usually happen come into mind. I can't help thinking about this as I sit here, yet I feel I shouldn't think so much about it. The possibility of failure seeps into my mind, and I can see myself never forgiving me for such mistakes. My breathing gets heavy for fear of what failure's consequences may bring. Like anxiety, I fear of failure, until something else wanders into my mind. As failure subsides, and my body is back to normal, the apathetic view of things set in. I start to feel lazy, and I don't want to work. I feel as if I am walking on a fine line, and a step to the right means laziness (although at the time is very tempting), just as a step to the left means productivity. The forces keeping me on this line are 1)the fear of failure which keeps me from being a sloth-like animal, and 2)the feeling that I am not being productive when I truly am. I guess it's like growing, in a sense, for the second force, that is, because when I see myself each day, I don't notice the changes that happen when comparing one's younger self to himself, now. Keeping this in mind, I guess I have found another reason why not to be lazy, but it seems like I will have to have self-disipline, which in a way is like teasing one's self for as long as you have to wait for the results. Maybe I'm still being a child who doesn't want to wait for his reward. I just don't know how to change myself in that direction of being so diligent even when things are not so great. I will have to learn if I want to remove myself from this line of opposing forces, and however tempting it may be to stay on this line, I will have to find the discipline within me to do such things as study, be diligent, and stay current with the right thing to do.

"This assignment was not as hard to figure out as I thought it was going to be. Actually it was quite easy. All I had to do was follow the simple directions. It is pretty cool in here. This library is not quiet though. I thought libraries are for people trying to read or study, but this one has lots of little rug rats talking and laughing. Oh well. Next weekend is going to be a lot of fun. I get to go see my boyfriend, who lives in Lubbock. I can't wait. Boy, I miss him a lot. I wonder how much my phone bill is going to be from calling him almost everyday. These two guys sitting by me are talking about weird things. I don't think they can figure out their computer. What do I want to buy today, when I go shopping?  I'm not quite sure. Maybe I will get a new dress. I really need to start looking for a homecoming dress. I have to have it by October because that is when Texas Tech's homecoming is. Hopefully my parents will pay for it. How do I tell them though, that on the way to San Antonio I got a speeding ticket. I guess I will just tell them that I was so anxious to see them that my anxiety caused me to speed. The police officer was not very understanding though, although I was at fault and I am going to pay the consequences. I need to study all day today, but I�m not really looking forward to it. If I get behind in my school work though, it will be extremely hard to catch back up, and I don't want to have to do that. Maybe I will go out tonight and have a really fun time dancing and stuff. That ought to compensate for me studying all day, and release the stress. At least I will have something to look forward to tonight. For now I only have studying to look forward to. Who do I want to go out with?  Maybe I will call up Jessica. She's pretty fun to hang out with, or maybe I will go to a club with my brother and his friends along with mine. No, I did that last night. It was fun though, maybe I should do that again tonight. Whatever the case, I need to have a night of fun planned so that tomorrow I can study all day again. I wonder what my roommates are doing. I bet they are watching TV  That's all they ever do. It must get boring for them, but evidently they like it. I can't do that, because I get overly-bored. They are the type of people that don't like to do anything outside of the house. I can't believe I got messed up with them. If I only knew that they were like that, I would have never agreed to live with them. They are kind of psycho. I don't know how anyone can fight and be unhappy as much as they are. I try to stay away from there, but maybe I need to find new places to go. My brother is probably half way to Wisconsin right now. I hope he is doing well. At least I got to see him before he left. That girl has a tattoo on her ankle in the shape of a snake. That is so ugly. I would never get a tattoo like that. I think it is so unattractive to guys. That lies right above the piercing on the face. I don't really think too bad of piercing your belly button, but anything else is too far. Actually, I have even thought about getting mine pierced, but I�m not quite sure if I want to go through all of that pain. Wow, that lady has a huge afro. Doesn't she know that it looks really bad. I guess if she thinks it looks good though, then that is all that matters.     ",1
"Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. Pennebaker, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 11 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy """"Titanic. """"  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her """"No. """"  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will """"turn into"""" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     ",1
"Well, I guess I get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. I always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. Oh well, I guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. Man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. I can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since I've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. It's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. I've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. I'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. Hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should I finally start off with something healthy, I mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. That would sound good. I need to do something to keep my freshman 15 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers. This computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and I'm now slowly falling asleep. Aww man, I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. It shouldn't be too bad. I don't even know if I'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. It's not like this is an official paper, but since I'm a perfectionist I can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. I guess it only works on AOL because it's just faster to type this way. I just realized that I get off track too easily, I may have some form of ADD. I can barely even listen to myself talk for 20 minutes. It's really hard when I'm face to face with someone. I just can't stand in one place for that long. So, I just zone out. as I'm doing now. I'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what I write. People sometimes think I'm drunk when I'm sending them mail, like when I sent a post card to a few friends back home while I was backpacking through Europe this summer with my brother. Where is he by the way? Oh yeah, he went to work today. I live with him, I thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. I'd always want what he had and vice versa. So, when we were in Europe, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. I guess the difference here is that . um I lost my track of thought, oh yeah, that we have separate rooms so we don't have to really see each other all the time. Just a moment, I need to change my posture. I'm becoming less attentive to myself. that's better. I wonder where my dog is, it's usually good to have him by my side. He is fluffy and fun to pet, well, at least he is there to substitute for my brother and keeps me company. That reminds me, I was supposed to walk him when I got home, but I haven't come around to doing that. I'll just go in 6 minutes when this is over. He can wait awhile. I wish I was a dog, he doesn't need anything but the occasional love, food, water, and he gets to sleep whenever he wants. I want to just take a while to lounge. I don't even get to do that much in the summer. I'm always active, either moving around, hanging out, or traveling. which I like a lot. Oh, I forgot to ask my adviser about the study abroad program. I'm a big language freak, in French at least, after I've finished learning that I want to do Italian and maybe Spanish. I'm slowly losing my Russian though, since my parents aren't there with me every evening to talk to. I need to move around a bit, my butt is getting sore from the chair. I need to get a new chair finally, this one just isn't doing it. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought, I wonder how much I've written already. It seems like my fingers haven't stopped moving for quite a while. It's a renewed sensation since I haven't played piano for a while. I need to finally get one of those too for my apartment. or else I'll forget how to do that too. It's weird how something you've done nearly your entire life can disappear so quickly. Yay, only a few more seconds left to write, 10 , 8, 5, 2, 1. Done ",0

"I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. """"   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. """"People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"""". Reads a poster on my wall.

I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End ",0

I wish that we were  I wish that she would get better and get on track. . . I wish I would get on track. . . I am so disorganized! Psy is going to be hard. I can't remember anything!  I never did study. study skills class is a joke b/c I know it won't help. boy, my typing sure does suck  I miss my work!  I need to email or write Christy. she was a sweet boss. Vicky hoggs the TV and is inconsiderate but lupe is nice. julie is too nice for her own good, and she talks about """"daddy's money"""" too much. people like that are annoying I hate it here b/c its just too much to handle I can't wait to go home this weekend!  that will be an adventure with all of the family roller coasters! I can't believe aunt rita did it before she got married!  actually, I can, but still its weird. linds needs to get over paul I hope we go see a movie on Friday. I hope she wears the necklace I got her. I miss Scott. . . I wish he were a little more considerate of my feelings. . Vicky is SoOOO presumptuous!  to change the channel while I am watching it??? I hope that no one thinks I am  nuts when they read this. I am getting upset b/c of how inconsiderate everyone is!!!  I am so glad mom called and dad emailed me! I miss them. I can't wait to go home. I hope the 20 mins goes by fast!!!  this is getting boring. I need to read for English marc is so funny. . . the way he jumps around subjects is so cute!  Scott thinks he is the only one with stress in his life. I am so glad I got the stupid """"brain picking"""" out of the way.

I wonder if they would know I did it for half the time, probably so. everything I am writing is stupid. I am tired and hate astronomy  its too broad a subject.

I wish that Noelle and Chris would stop being so """"happy"""" and Sappy with each other. its sick and I think it is unhealthy that he cries about her all the time. he�s a big baby and I think it would never work with them b/c its soooo sappy and I think its unhealthy that they plan their lives around each other when they have only been dating for 7 months. Scott and I don't do that and we have been going out for 4 years. maybe we should break up. . yeah right, that'll never happen b/c we're too comfortable, bad!  Oh well, that�s life and what can I do? Vicky totally monopolizes the room. Marc is so funny. I can�t WAIT TO go home!  I miss my parents, they have such a hand full with Lindsay!  Why can't she be more normal and get """"it"""" together. I am tired of everyone blaming me for her troubles, its not my fault, I am bossy but that didn't make her the way she is. Yes!!!  only 4 mins to go!  Thank GOD. I really should go to church here, I sure have strayed into the last 2 months, we never missed before we moved.

I don't like her too much, thought she is okay some times, but still, UNCONSIDERATE!!!  just b/c she�s a soph, doesn't mean she�s superior to me in any way!!!  She needs to just  get over herself and go to lupes for the night. . . I liked it better when she spent the night out. I am hungry. stress makes me hungry, I am mad and upset with vic, and Scott too, I hope he called, so I can call him back!  YES. . . one more min. this was harder that I thought b/c I am soooo tired. couldn't check my messages b/c VICKY was on the phone!!!  AHHHHHH  I don't like her!!!!!  she needs to be more considerate like me. I bend over backwards to be considerate for her!!!  ahhhhhhhhhh  THE END. THANK GOD!!! ",0
"     I am doing a stream of conscience assignment for pyshcology. Am I suppose to use correct grammar and punctation? I hope not. I still type using one finger, but I think I can type pretty fast foer using one finger. You think since I am using one finger that I wouldn't make any grammatical mistakes but that's not true. Oops am I suppose to time this?  Oh, no you time it for me. wow 20 minutes is a long time. I don't even look at the screen when I type. just the keybopard. my hands are tired. my favorite channel is TLC. It's great. Right now a story about conjoined twins are on. My boyfriends is back in plano. my thoughts jump around faster than i can type i don't have any thoughts anymore ihad to turn off the tv all i could do was listen to it maybe that is why i ran out of thoughts maybe that is why people say tv frys (or is it fries?) your brains  I don't think tv makes you studpi there are plenty of educational shows my sister learned to read through sesame sttreet, i don't miss my parents much is that bad?  It was kind of annoying living at home with them my phone is rinignfg am I allowed to get that i guess i can call them back in like 15 minutes i think it is the guy I met from they gym who was calling. College doesn't feel like its satarted. it still feels like summer fore me. I only have class every other day so its kind of hard getting into tht study mode. am I writing too much. am I suppose to just write a few thoughts as I have them or cointinuously type. I hope its continuosouyl type cause that is what I am doing. Do ya'll actually read this?  I wouldn't really want my   real   stream of consciencce read. Ithink thoughts and emotions are very personal and should only be expressed or shown in needed situations or with a person you trust. What if my   real   stream of conscience was that I wished somebody would blow up UT ( which it's not I promise). Ya'll would redflag me and secretly watch me, so I don't really like doing this assignment. I don't mind it actually. It's pretty simple and something interesting to do, I guess a way to learn about yourself. I don't like writing much. I use to keep a journal but I was too lazy to write in it all the time. usually when I wrote in it it was when I was pissed off, so everytime I went back and read it it seemed like I was a really angry person all the time. I wantred the journal to be like a memory book. But, if I was feeling any strong emoitons II didn't feel like writing in it. I guess I probably talked on the phone. My cell phone gets horrible reception here. It is hard to talk to my boyfriend back in plano cause he always breaks up. He's not really my boyfriend anymore, but he really is. I don't think that makes sense. Ten more minutes. so. my nails are shiny I'm tired of doing this. I don't get why we are doing this either. If mine is this long and there about 300 people in each class and say there are about 5 classes, that's 1,5000 papers. Nobody probably reads this. It is probably random spot reading if anything so this will get submitted and overlooked so I don't really see a point in this I wonder if everybody has around the same stream of conscience. I bet a lot of people are writing about how they have to do this assignment and they don't see a point to it really. I don't know what I want to be when I grow up. I wanto to make a lot of money. I was gooing to do psychology but everybody is doing it. 1 out of 3 people I ask are a psychology major. It is very interesting and I loved it in highschool, but future wise there's not much you can do with it as I see it. There is a teacher or a psychologist or maybe a social worker. And if 1 out of 3 people are doing it at UT and there is about 50,000 people, wells that's about 17,000 pyschologists and teachers alone from UT, there is still to mention Tech, and other schools where most people are doing psychology too. I think everyopne should take psychology though. but I think way too many people are majoring in it. Actually, I think majoring in it fine so that way you can get an extensive look at how human nature and the mind functions, but I think that knowledge should be applied to other fields. SO everyone should study pyschology, but not pursue a field in it. I really want to be a person who does case studies on dreams. I think dreams are so interesting. I had a dream about Roseanne the show and that I met the cast. It's really weird. I remebr thinking I should get their autographs so I can put it up on my wall. Sometimes, though, I think people see too much into dreams. I think people on drugs have deep dreams, or maybe they are having reaaly   fake   dreams. Like their brain is just so confused it is just sending randome imAages. I don't now. I think drugs let ypou tap into another side of your brain. I think they can open your mind. I think drugs like X can open your mind, but I think that you should learn how to open your mind without drugs. I think no one should do drugs on a regular basis. I wonder if a lot of philosophy and psychology teachers have done drugs. I personally think they have one time or another, and if they haven't I wonder what their thoughts and reactions would be like to drugs. Oprah did a show about X users, I only saw part of it. Some of them said that it   opened their eyes   and that if they were doing their work and had a mental block, the drug would help their thoughts flow. Oprah was still like   that's very bad  . I guess it is bad, they should learn to let their mind flows without drugs. It's sad if the only was you can open your mind is thru drugs. ",1
"I am about to go to my first sorority date dash with my boyfriend. It is at Malibu Grand Prix. We are going to drive race cars and play video games. The tv has a show on about a man that slit a nine year old's throat from ear to ear. I think that is disgusting. I can't believe our society has people like this. I am very excited about my date dash. However, I have been feeling very overwhelmed with school lately. There is so much reading in every class. I don't feel like I am ever going to get caught up. College is so hard. Tomorrow I need to go get a new backpack and shirt at the Coop. I am excited about the football game on Saturday. This is my first college football game. I think it is going to be very hot and miserable. I will probably complain a lot and want to leave at half time. My friends say that they aren't going to let me leave early. It should be interesting. I also have to go straight to work after the game is over. I am going to do a lot of homework on Sunday. Hopefully I will get a little more caught up. I feel very stressed about school. This week is better than last and hopefully next week will be better than this one. I know it is going to get better. The guy on tv is a psycho. He is now saying that God told him to sacrifice the boy. He thinks he did the right thing. That is ridiculous along with the insanity plea. It makes me sick that people can do these horrible crimes and then plead insanity. This guy is not insane he is just a sicko and I think he deserves the death penalty. Tomorrow I have to go to class from 9:3011:00 and then I'm going to take a huge nap. I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. I guess I will just get used to less sleep. This college thing pretty much sucks. Sometimes I wish I would have taken the easy way out and gone to the local community college. However, I am getting a much better education here at UT. I live at home and commute everyday. This is really stressful because I have to leave my house at least one hour before class actually starts. I am about to go out now and I think this was a very interesting assignment. I am probably going to be late to the house where we are supposed to meet. ",0
"Am not in the best of moods right now. I have something bothering me at this time. But I take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. I am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside.  However, life goes on. Am good now, or at least not feeling so down. This is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. Sounds really bad, but I console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others.   AT this very moment Am listening to music while typing. I really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. And it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. If you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. I always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow.   I decided to do my assignment now, because I was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time I will have. So if I don't do it now, I`ll probably not have sufficient time.   Guess what! Life in college is very stressing, so I always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. I always thought that I was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. But hey, life must go on, so I am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress.   I like my life right now, I really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, I know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what I am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life.    I don`t type that very well, so there will be I hope not too many errors. Life is one of the best things we have. We can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a GOOD impact.     ",1
"Well I am sitting at my desk. It's kinda dark in here so I just turned on the lamp. I have a lot of homework to finish, most of it for the psych class. My homework has not been too bad so far. Just a lot of reading. I am ready to go home and see my cat, I really miss him more than other things that I should probably miss more. My mom would get mad if she heard me say that, but sadly it is true. Well my mind is a blank, I can't really think of anything to say I know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind, but my mind goes completely blank whenever I try to write anything, no matter what it is. I guess that is why I never could keep a journal or anything like that. I would start out the first day writing some, then it just tapered off until I stopped writing completely. I have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on. Wow 20 minutes is a long time, its only been 5 since I started. I'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration, but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind won't cooperate. I guess that is what you are trying to figure out. It is ironic how the mind works, that is why I have always wanted to take a psychology class, so I could better understand its inner workings. I am frustrated that I really cannot think of a single thing however. I miss my best friend, Faith. She is at Oachita (spelling?) in Arkadelphia. It is about 8 hours from here. I am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break, but that is a little hard without a car. I will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there. Surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it (like they originally planned) and are keeping it at home (where it is currently getting no use). I guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time. I am only going home once before the holidays. That's only for my high school's homecoming. Which I am kind of excited about. I know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game, so I will get to see them. That is the only weird thing about college. You realize how much your friends meant to you. It is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to. But, luckily I have met a few great people, and we have become good friends. I knew 8 people coming down here and only three of them I was actually good friends with. The other five were more acquaintances. I already semi-knew my roommate, she went to school in the same district, and we met through our parents. We have since become better friends. I am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things, but I figured I might as well write something. Well let's see. I went on a mission trip to Mexico this summer. I only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk. It was truly an awesome experience. I am a changed person because of that two week experience. Well I guess I won't get into any other subject. My time is ticking away, funny how it goes by faster when you type. very ironic. and that is about all, thank you! ",1
"Right now I am feelng a bit anxious to be done with this writing assignment. I don't think I have ever written for 20 minutes straight and I don't know if I can do it. I feel full because I ate a big lunch and I am looking forward to being done with all of my homework so I can sleep good tonight. I feel relaxed and stress free and it probably has to do with the fact that I have been sitting down in front of my computer for several hours now doing my own thing. That is, anything I want to and not things that I need to get done. I feel good after doing my own thing because I don't feel commited to anyone or anything. Okay, 5 minutes have passed. I can't do this. What am I going to type about?  I don't know how to describe the way I feel or my sensations. This assignment is a trick isn't it. It is meant to show that there is no way to express them and you just feel them internally. Oh boy, I am excited about the coming week because I just joined one of the choirs here at UT and I can't wait to practice. Music makes me feel good and I love to sing. Singing takes me away from all the daily stresses of this world and helps me appreciate the finer things in life. Also, there is a girl I met in the music school that I might get to see when I go to choir. She is nice and I wouldn't mind talking to her and getting to know her better. I am know thinging about Maryann. I don't know why but maybe because the girl at the music school has brunette hair just as Maryann has. I wish I would have told Maryann the way I felt about her along time ago. The choir director is really nice. She took time to audition me with on days notice and accepted me without many questions asked. I don't know anyone in choir and I hope I make friends in there pretty quick. In fact, I don't know many people here at UT yet. I feel lonely when I eay along or I don't have anything to do on weekends. It is different from back home when I could call one of my friends up and we would just hang out together. I am now thinking about my weight. I just lost a lot of weight and I want to make sure I keep it off. Eating here at Jester is tempting to get a lot of food because it is all you can eat. If I gain weight. I am going to feel down about myself again and that is absolutly what I don't wat. The pastor this morning was powerful and I liked EVFREE all together. I will probably visit Grace Bible next week but I anticipate I will join EVFREE. They have great worship there and I like the pastor. Their first service will take awhile to get used to because it is so traditional, but I know I can handle it. I think that church would be a great place to grow as a Christian and meet other Christians. I hear Chris' voice in the hall and I am thinking about him rollerblading and the cop telling him to take the rollerblades off and walk home. That's funny. Okay. i have 7 minutes left. I can do this. Wow. time flies when you are typing about your feelings. Now I am thinking about my roommate Mike. I am wondering what he thinks about me. I don't know if he is mad at me for anything or if he likes me. I hope he likes me because I want to be able to get along with the person I am living with. I hope to be a witness to him this year and maybe he will accept Christ soon. That would be great and I want God to do that through me. I feel so sorry for Bernie right now. She has the problem with Aaron and she doesn't know what to do about it. I wish Aaron would grow up and realize that he needs to back off. He's been ticking me off lately. It makes me mad when I think about him and I'm mad now. Why does he act like a baby and whine to everyone?  Why can't he take things like a man. All he has been doing is whinning to Bernie and telling her how """"he gets lonely eating by himself everyday"""" and trying to make Bernie feel sorry for him. AH!  Three more minutes!  I'm excited. I didn't think I could do this but it went by really fast. I am not looking forward to doing laundry this weekend. I have never done laundry in my entire life and I really don't know how to. What if I turn my clothes different colors?  What if I have to buy all new clothes because I messed up on the laundry?  Ooo. i'm worried about that. It is so cool that I found all these old Nintendo games on the internet that I can play in my spare time. I haven't played some of those games in 10 years and they bring back good childhood memories. My email program just dinged so I have email which is very exciting. I can't wait to read it. It is now time for me to stop writing so this is it. I leave with a good feeling of anticipation. ",1
"Today has been a good day so far. I only had one class today, Philosophy, and it was better than the first time I went. I get scared here. There are so many people and I don't know where I stand yet. It is so much different from where I am from. My hometown is extremely small and everyone knows everyone so coming to Austin was a huge change for me. Everyone seems so smart and everyone seems to know exactly what they are doing, the classes they are taking and everything. I have know idea what I plan on majoring in. Right now I am undeclared, Natural Science and I don't know where that will lead me. Maybe I will figure it out one day though. I am sure I have too. It is so hot outside. My mom told me that it hasn't rained in my hometown in 51 days. I can't believe that. That is so outrageous. She also said that there were grass fires all around our house. That is so scary. I don't want anything to happen to them. We live so far out and all the fires have been our way. It is so scary. My dad works all the time. All he does is work. My parents are both coming down this weekend for the first UT football game. I am so excited. I think it will be a blast. I have gone to tons of games and they are always a blast. I don't understand this friend I have. She has always wanted to go to Baylor, ever since she was a little girl. Now, she has this boyfriend who goes to a&m and now she is going to transfer to a&m to be with him. And to top it off, they are getting engaged. She has been with this guy for only three months. I don't understand people sometimes. I mean you think you know someone so well and then one day you think you don't know them at all. There are only a few people from my high school here. I am glad though. I want to meet other people, to broaden my horizon. I didn't know my roommate before I moved here and we get along great. She is so nice and I think we will be pretty good friends. I have this one friend who did come here from my high school and she is negative about everything and everyone and it drives me crazy. She gripes about the sorority stuff and about people going out at night, about people laying out during the day, and just stuff that shouldn't even matter at all. I mean who cares about these people. Let them do what they want and don't criticize them. It is so stupid the way she acts sometimes. She thinks that I am the only one she can hang out with here and I feel bad because I want to go meet more people and do what I want without being criticized for it. I wonder what my brother is doing these days. He lives in San Marcos and I haven't even talked to him since I have been here. Maybe I will call him today. He is 3 years older than I am. We get along really well, but he has a girlfriend that he is always with so that is another reason why I haven't seen him in a while. I am in this sorority. I don't know if it is me though. I mean I don't know if I want to tie myself down to all of that stuff. It is kind of hard to tell right now though. I will have to give it time I think. If I don't like it I will just drop out. I am so tired these days it seems like I have something to do all the time. Like I never get a chance to just stop what I am doing to rest. I love Austin though and I am really happy here. My boyfriend and I are doing pretty good too. I am glad about that. He lives in Denton and goes to UNT. It is really sad though that we can't be together now and we are so far apart. I don't know really what to do. I cry a lot about it because I love this guy so much and I want everything to work out, but I just don't know how we are going to be able to handle not seeing each other for weeks and weeks at a time. It is horrible. But, I think we can do it. We have been together for 2 years and about 2 months now so I think it is possible. I don't want anyone else either. I mean he is everything I ever wanted so I don't think I should even look for anyone else. He is the best. Plus, guys scare me like all the STDs these days I wouldn't know who was lying to me or who was telling the truth and so I think I will just stay with the guy I have now. Oh, I miss him so much. I have two Chinese pug dogs and I miss them too. College is such a big change. Especially for me, coming to Austin from such a small town. But, I can handle it. ",0
"     I am sitting in my room. There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me. The sound of musics floats in from the next room. Paint smells intoxicate me. I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment. The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up. My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan. I wonder whey she looks so upset about it. The air conditioner begins to run. I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor. Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class. I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense. The phone rings next to me. I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit. I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up. Funny how the time just slips away like that. You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone. You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now. My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now. The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet. They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something. It makes my sheets look pretty though. The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow. Everything is starting to fade. My mind and eyes start to slow down. Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste. I want it to slow down. Everything should be slower these days. I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays. I watch TV until I feel like eating something. I can smell my mama start to cook dinner. She always makes such good food for me. I smell cheese melting on something. I think it might be broccoli. But you can't smell brocolli. I keep spelling that differently. I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled. How funny. Things like that when they happen. LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that. I realized I haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five. I think I will try to do it again in a minute. I hope this isn't too bad. ",1
"That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span of twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 550 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. Baseball has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the Longhorn Club Baseball teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the University of Texas Baseball Team. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the Longhorn Club team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. Travis Johnson ",1
"Which is funny, because I have no idea what the hell it is I want to say. I guess all I can say for now is that colege is sorta a rude awakening. No one give a shit about your ass anymore. it's all on your own. I love this place though. No kidding. What makes it all funny is, the people are nice, yet in a way, weird. Weird in a sense that they are so superficial and incredibly narrow minded about EVERYTHING. It's like the asians stick amongst themselves, the white boys stick amongst their littl eall american jock group,(of which I detest), and the chicks are well, they're just there. Forget I ever said anything about females here. Some are really on the bizarre side. Some are really great and interesting. Then their's the ones you wonder a whole lot about. This reminds me of high school already. I wonder what writing about anything for a good twenty minutes will do for my psychological condition. Does it make me say,. . alert to my surroundings? Or is all this just a buch of really great BS? Something tells me there is a higher lesson to be learned here,. even if it IS BS. So, It's about 1:07 in the damn morning, and I'm thinking Jeez, I need to finish this quickly so I can finich my economics. Speaking of which, I cannot believe how incredibly and uterrly boring my economics professor is. Six times is how much I fell asleep. she is certainly entertaining with her material, boy. This assignment sorta reminds me of my favorite book, the Catcher in the Rye. I feel like Holden Caulfield, for some freaking reaosn. I guess I just feel apathetic towards everything at the moment. I don't know why. . great, I just figured out how the hell the refrigerator and the microwave can coexist together. This is a bit strange. I sudden;y feel as if I'm just rambling to myself. As if I had nothing better to do than to talk to myself. Then again. It's 1 o'clock. What else can I do at 1 in the morning? Evidently nada. One thing bothers me though. All my friends are constantly talking about what fine chick he sae today and how much he wanted her. That;s perfectly normal and all, but I just don't get it. For one thing, I really hate just """"asking out a girl"""". That is so stereotypical and well, it sucks. Men are so pathetic sometimes when it comes to the opposite sex. I'm only too glad that we run this whole damn world,a not the ladies. Thy would screw up everything, damn near! Great, now I'm being cynical. And I'm still talking to myself. This can't be good. I think I should talk to a therapist about this someday. Better yet, I'm jsut going to talk to the professor. This is nuts. I need a vacation. Preferably somewhere in the Carribean. My brains are etting fried up from too much studyin and what not. So,. . I have two minutes left. Great. Good. I was getting a bit hot. That;s better. I love air conditioning. Anyway,. . whoa, . yet another surprising twist. Where did I hear someone say  """"she's skinny cause she's thinner, for she eats her breakfast, lunch and dinner, she takes care of her body, for she's a really great winner. Good nutrition rules?"""" That does it. I'm calling my psychotherapist. I wonder why there isn't a thing called linner of dunch. I mean, there's brunch and all. . ",1
Well I start typing now. so I don't really know my computer stopped making the fan noise why does it do that. the simpsons are on next door I could watch that but I'm stuck doing this oh well what is that oh yeah I like that I'm full even though the food is not good its all you can ear I love all you can eat. well since I don't really know what to talk about I can just write about things that I my phone rang can I answer it I don't think so oh well ill call them back I hope it was not JB calling about the hell raiser meeting damn oh but I can write bout things I don't really talk to other people bout like when I left I didn't really expect robyn and I to last really although I wanted to and but now it is not really that hard and I love her but kinda find myself wishing it was harder so that I could hav an excuse if I needed one to get out. but I have differing opinions on it mostly cause one moment I miss her and jus want to hang out with her but the next I get annoyed that I have to talk to her. and when other girls talk to me here I feel like I shouldn't even though there is no reason not to and robyn wouldn't even care the slightest cause she is so understanding and this is why our whole thing is not that hard. cause she makes it easy. that's the main reason I stayed with her cause usually I don't have relationships ever. this is mainly my first and definitely my first serious one which is another thing sometimes it seems so serious I'm like back off but when she acts casual I want her to act more serious. I guess the whole thing is stupid and I shouldn't worry bout it cause I am easy going and I should let things go with the flow I'm going to call dusting when I'm done so I can see if he is going to the hell raisers. wow it is quiet in here with no music I want to turn on ole Kenny but ill wait 10 min left this is going by fast. I thought I was barely talking. I wish I knew her name I talk to her everyday and she is in 3 of my classes and she introduces me to people and I don't even know her name that's kinda fucked up but I could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name. that would work I wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all I really do anymore is read and study. quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh I am talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy I'm going to his room in well 13 53sec so I can wait no 20 - 1353 well 1412 now but yeah I think I'm going to work out after the meeting. I wonder if they let anyone in that 70s show is on I hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man a guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night. it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with a pistol right in front of her. robyn felt bad but I didn't know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in a long time so to me it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. this is getting long now that I'm looking forward ahead in the direction of I'm thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired I'm not blinking I need to ok wow that burned I shut them for like 5 sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny I burped and hiccupped at the same time. I wonder what this is going to say about me I don't really care though cause I think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on a lot of levels the lie detector was cool though I think I could beat it maybe but well that's all ,0
"I really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    I am listening to a Dave Matthew's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves Dave Matthews. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to Houston to go to graduate school. Dave M. was going to be in Houston on Friday and Austin on Saturday. So Robyn ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help Justin move and see the concert in Houston. On our way to Houston the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. Robyn was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to Austin and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to Dave. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was Dave, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 19 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  ",1
"and I feel like I'm starting to get sick, and I really feel like going home for a while and forget about everything involved with college and responsibility. oh well I'm also really sick of guys and everything that they bring about in my life. not really but they seem to confuse me a lot, especially when the one I really love is way too old for me, but he is my best friend. I can't even sleep anymore because I have so much on my mind, everything that was familiar to me in my life has been dramatically changed in a period of a couple of weeks. I miss my family not like homesick but just miss being a part of my family circle. I don't feel like I truly belong anywhere anymore. when I go home all my stuff is here and I feel like I'm missing something important in my life when I'm away from home. I am really worried about money, I have a car payment due in about a week and I feel bad taking money from my parents constantly. I am still working some in san Antonio but it gets hard to go back and forth every other weekend. but I'm worried about not working at all because I need money now more than ever. the real reason I don't want to quit working there is because my boss is like my best friend who I am madly in love with and who I have been in love with for the last 2 years. I miss him so much and if I don't work there anymore I'm afraid I won't get to see him anymore. that would be one of the worst things that could happen he makes me laugh I get mad at him but I get mad at him because I do love him. oh well obviously he is in my mind more than just about anything. I forget about him occasionally when I go out with my friends or other guys, but the minute I think I have forgotten about him. he calls. he called me 4 times this weekend, and it makes me wonder what is he thinking does he miss me as much as I miss him if I'm lucky the answer is yes, but he may just think of me as a really good friend. and maybe that is all we are meant to be I just want to get out in the open even though I'm sure he all ready knows. but I'm young I should only be thinking about school but that can be easier said than done 18 years. of my life was spent in san Antonio and I miss everything I left behind even though I am enjoying things here too I mean it is all a new experience and I like not having to really answer to anybody but myself and God. even though I completely respect my parents it was time for me to grow up and lead my own life and make all my own decisions. that is all.

"Last week I took a Chinese Clep test. It started out very well, I understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. As you know, the Cantonese language is written in two different formats. One way, the tradition way, was the one I learned since I was a little kid. The other format was a newer, I believe it originated in Hong Kong or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking"""". Anyways, I opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. So I spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. Then, I decided to just skip through to the end. That is when I figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. """"Damn it!"""" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. But of course, that was last week, and I already have my results back from the test. I believe I did relatively well. Relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. Today, Monday, is the first day I have been to my RLM Biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. I must say, I am completely exhausted. Biology discussion was quite an episode. We had an TA that had a really really bad accent. Much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. Some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. Then we took a quiz, which I found to be a bit difficult because I didn't understand teh oral review. I had to buy books today. Spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that I probably won't be needing much. I could have found many many other uses for that 129, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. Geez, look at my grammar in this essay, I think my english teacher would have a heart attack. Psych class was pretty interesting today. Dr. Pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. I was completely fascinated by the experiment. Too bad I can't say the same for my Philosophy class. Its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. And so I obeyed. I notice that when I'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. But of course, I wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. You can definitely tell at what point in the lecture I crashed. The funniest part is, I lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. I think since I have been here at UT for the fall, I have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. I have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. I worry about other stupid things that I feel the need not to bring up at this moment. However, I have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. I have been recreating too much. This weekend though, we went to Barton Springs to see a friend that came up to visit us from UTSA. Barton Springs was nothing like I had imagined. I absolutely loved it. Everything except the coldass water. Then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. It felt like summer again. Of course, I had enrolled in the UT Summer program. A little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. I miss summer. ",0
"I am sitting here on the hardest chair known to man. Even with a seat cushion its still not comfortable. My roommate is talking to her boyfriend on the phone. They talk forever. They never discuss anything interesting either. Speaking of boyfriends, I miss my boyfriend. I am going to be really busy this week and I am worried that I won't be spending enough time with him. I have an application to fill out for a girls' group called the Texas Lonestars. It sounds fun but I am worried that maybe its not quite me. """"  The girls are really obsessed with each other and I never get along that well with girls. Girls usually hate me. I think because they're jealous and also because I am pretty intimidating. Meagan White probably hates me the most. I wish she would get over herself. God she is a bitch. It makes me insecure when Matt's ex-girlfriends are always still calling him, IMing him, and text messaging him. I trust him but its hard not to be bothered by it. I hope we stay together for a long time. I love him a lot. Geez its freezing cold in here. I think I get abnormally cold. I can't handle temperatures that are less than 73 degrees. Kelly and Chance are talking about getting married. but not to each other. I wonder if they will marry each other? I bet they will. what a boring couple they are. I think I'm too harsh on Kelly. I always judge her but then again she judges other people all the time. She is very racist. She hates our asian suitemate because she smells. But it is true. she always stinks up the bathroom. This is the easiest assignment I have ever done but it does kinda suck because its time consuming. I am tired and tired of school. I wonder if I should stay in business. I don't think its totally """"me. """"  But then again I don't even know what is """"me. """"  I only know what I'm good at. I don't really know what I even like. I think I think too much about the future. I always over-analyze things too. I can't help it. I'm a perfectionist. at least I want to be perfect. It seems the harder I try the less perfect I become. Does that even make sense? My back hurts. I'm trying to sit up straight so I have good posture and so I don't have to feel my fat rolls on my stomach touching. I wish I was skinnier. but I can't say I'm totally unhappy with my size. I wish my hips weren't as wide and my tummy was a little flatter. Yeah. dropping 5 pounds would be really nice. My face is starting to break out again. If there's anything that has been a huge pain in my life its my skin. It affects so much of my life and attitude. I thought the birth control was helping. maybe its just stress. Yes, I am very stressed. I have not had time to breathe since school started. And I know its only going to get busier. Sometimes I wish I could just escape. freeze time and come back without it costing me anything. My fingers hurt. And I'm still cold. I'm slumped over now, I give up on the posture and fat rolls. I feel guilty that my family misses me so much and I don't miss them. I really don't. Not even my sister Emily. which is a surprise. I thought I would at least miss her. but I don't. I should call them tomorrow. Maybe my mom could help me with my lonestars application. I have so much stuff to do. I'm scared. Why am I so touchy feely emotional lately? I used to never think of myself as emotional, but I think ever since I started dating matt I have become much more emotion oriented. I think I have become more insecure too. That does not really make sense though. But its like now I have to please him too. One more person to impress. before it was just myself and kinda my parents. but mostly my competition. I'm very competitive. I think of everyone as my competition. I bet that is unhealthy. but then again. what is healthy? I can't think of a single person I know that is """"healthy"""" or has """"healthy relationships. """" I am almost done now. I'm just waiting for the clock to wind down so I cna start on yet another homework assignment. oh joy! I wonder why matt has not called me back. I need him to lift my spirits and to talk to. He is really wonderful. is that normal that I'm so obsessed with him? ",1
"I just went to the union to eat chick-fil-a. i had a coupon for a free meal but they didn't honor it and I felt like I had waste my effort as well as my frined of walkin to the union and wasted our money paying for such an overpriced meal. now, I'm sleepy- I always get sleepy after I eat- especially greasy food. I don't think I have a weight problem, but I htink I should make more frequent trips to gregory to tone myself up. I don't' put much on personal appearance but it's not something to not take care of. i wish I could go take a nap now but I want to finish this assignment and I don't 'want to lie down right after I eat because I heard that it makes u retain all the fat in ur meal if u go to sleep right after u eat because ur body thinks ur sleepign and stores all the fat. i'm not sure how that works but wutever. i'm on aol right now. waiting for a friend from back home in houston to sign on. so I decided to check out the psychology web site while I waited. he's prolly in class at Rice University right now. he's an engineer major and also my best friend. i have two best friends - kristina and stephen. me and stephen have only been best friends for a short period of time where kristina has been my best friend since the sixth grade. she's also in houston. I hate austin it sucks. i wish I was home - me and stephen are confused as to wut defines our relationship- we have strong feelings for each other. romantic one. but we don't seem to think a long distance relationship is ideal. plus we're not committing peoople. i'm awfully tired of this assignment and only 7 minutes have passed by. my neck hurts. i'm usually a tying sorta person. and I guess this is good practice for me- I use the back space key a lot - I wish I could type as well as my roomate jenny lau. she's an excellent typist. i'm just a scrub typer- I have bad coordination- I cna't dance- can't sing - can't 'type- can't play video games. sigh. i'm a good studier though. i don't' mind takin time to do things throughly-- I'm slow at pretty much everything I do but I do them sorta well. i wish stephen would hurry up and get on. he doestn' have his computer because it's at home but I'm sure there are plenty of resources at Rice university. i wish I went to rice. he told me about wut they did up there and it sounds so fun I wish I could get in and I wish I could afford it!then I would sooooo want to go! I think if I do ok this year I could prolly get in. but I don't know abou the other part - I'm gong to ut on scholarship money and I thinki t's going to run out before the 4 years are over. i wish money wasnt' such a big issue in my life. i'm unemployed right now and I have no cash flow but out. it sucks. i think next semester I'll start a work study thing. i wish my parents were architects adn hemotoligists liek stephen's parent's - they're on their way to becoming millionaires. i wish this was in store for my parents. they make lousy money and htey have 4 kids and 3 of whom are in college. my brother is at the university of houston right now and so is my sister. and my best friend. ltos of ppl from school go there. my home town houston. i like it there better than here. i'm sleepy. 13 minutes have gone by . man. where are u stephen? I slept with his tshirt on my bear last nite. i think about him often. i don't think I want to start a romantic relationship with him because I don't think it's worth the risk. i'm an idealist and a romantic and I doubt my best friend could fulfill my romantic desires as a boyfriend. he's a passive person who lets other people control. however he's always in control in his mind. he's so smart and so quiet. he keeps all his thoughts to himself unless u pry at him. he'll open up to me more than his life long best friend brian. i think it's because I'm a gurl and I'm always nosy. so I don't know. i doubt we're right for each other but u never knwo these things we could end up married. highly unlikely but possible. stephen said that he'll save up his money and take me to hawaii- I know that sounds so stupid and so unlikely but I believe it he does get a job soon. a high paying one- like at a computer place like this summer. he can do it - and if he does save up enough money- he really will take me. we've discussed it and he said he'd really try and I believe him. i guess it sounds like I'm trying to convience myself. maybe I am. but I really want to go and I belive that he could make this happen for the both  of us. he believes in having fun and living life so spring break we're there! I hope! hehehe. ok. 2 more minutes and I cna quit. after this I guess I'll write my lil estebie an email - this would be his second day of class at rice. he loves it there. he' an owl all the way. well ok times basically up bye bye bye bye!!!!

"What is love of an emotional basis? How do you know you are in love? Is there a boundary to love? Are there limits? Many people ask these questions, including myself, but cannot find an answer to these questions. I believe that this can only be found out by experience, where you test these limits and grow by it. I have noticed in my personal life that I grow emotionally and mentally each time I find a new partner. Love must be a learning experience right? It seems to be that way. I was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school, were I felt as if I was in love with this girl. We took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have. But this form of love seemed to build so quickly. As I looked back at the letters we wrote each other, it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two. How cold that be? Does love come at once, or does it grow on you? Nine months later, we ended our relationship. It seemed to be the most painful event I had experienced. I next felt like I loved a girl I barely knew. We dated, but nothing came of this, however the crummy feeling you feel after a relationship is over lasted almost a half year. How could someone I just dated for a span of a month create such an effect on me? By my senior year, sometime in January, I became interested in another girl. By this time I had felt that I had grew and I would be able to make this girl happy, and would not make he same mistakes I did with the last girls. As time passed my love grew for this girl, something I had not felt in so long and so strongly. Eventually (1 year and 1 month) things deteriorated. How could I have let this love slip? I thought I had mastered the relationship sector of my life. During the Summer I met a new girl, whom I am currently with. I don't want to make the same mistake I have before but is it inevitable. Will this relationship be like the others, or will I love her stronger than the other girl?  ",0
"During the weekend, I love to go to mall. To buy something that makes me feels good. If I have a chance to go in the mall, First, I would like to eat something in the restaurant because I get starve. I love to eat Chinese food. Sometimes I choose sweet sour chicken and fried rice. That is my favorite food. If I have a second choice that it would be pepper steak and white rice. When I am full, I start thinking of what I need t shop around other place to buy  what I need. At this time , I need to buy fall season cloths. All I have right now is one pair of jean and one sweater. That is not enough to wear for the rest of the season. All I need is one more extra sweater and another pair of jean. And then I would like to buy something to decorate my house. I would like to have of book holder because I have lots of books. Whenever I see interesting things on TV I would like to go to the mall and buy it. In my kitchen, I saw a microwave is not working anymore. On TV the commercial shows they are having a big sale in JCPenney. It cost about only sixty dollars. I think that is a good deal to buy a microwave for sixty dollars. I try to get a new laptop. But my budget is not enough to buy another computer. They are a pretty good deal for a Dell computer in a market place. The computer market is having a pretty good mark down of price now. But when I get everything together, it cost over one thousnad dollars  I need to spend all of it. I think the computer is popular consumer in the market. But i make a mind that I don't  want to spend not much money, because it is not worth it. Spending is not the way to feel better. How are you going  to control your mind is better way to concern it.   We are so busy living in collage life.  Everyone needs a rest in the weekend. Shopping in a mall is good subject of good things to relax your mind. Control you're budget and thinking of controlling your mind is the best way to think.        ",0
"     oops i don't know what i just did. But back to that, i always feel bad for the customers because who wants a server thats all sweaty? I would be so Thank god Alright im not really sure what to do now. I just typed for a complete 10 mins then the side of my hand hit return. Soooo i guess i'll type for ANOTHER 20 mins to make sure i get the credit. Im not an overachiever either, but i might as well just type. We're going to light some candles in our room now. My roommate just said our room smells like shoes. . mmmmmmmm. Luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh(er). Thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty! Alright i feel a headache coming. I think because im hungry. I ate, what. maybe 4 or 4 1/2 hours ago?? aaaaah im hungry!!! Morning seems so far away. Alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again. thanks!!!! yes i am frustrated. stupid hand!! its because i type fast and don't pay attention to what im hitting so much. I just get sooo into this, haha. hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine. oh well mine looks prettier. Ok  i need a date book. I just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go. I want one of our good friends from Chicago to come in hte weekend of the A&M game. that would be fun for him. But problem. I think thats the day after Thanksgiving. The morning after actually. Shit. My friend Jess will be in Chicago until Saturday, and I know im going to Lubbock. . But i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all. But what to do. Because Austin honesctly doesnt compare to CHicago. So i need something fun for him to do while hes here. I mean besides 6th street because he is a club freak. But its great, because hes so much fun to go out with!! And even better, he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above. So essentially he can get us in with no problem (not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls) because all the fun ones are 21 and over. Shhh don't tell my mom I told her i stopped going to them! She found out once because of jessicas crazy parents. oooh i can't stand that. But we still continued and had a jolly time. Everyone there knows us and that we're underage. Its great. really the chicago cops, the whole town is nuts. Everyone thinks texas is laid back, which it is, but really the chicago cops really just don't give a shit. There are so many undercover cops at the doors who know us, and even ones who work outside just patrolling the streets. But they look for more trouble than just underage drinkers. Kind of funny. One night about 8 cops were leaving this really big club downtown CHicago and stopped us on our way out and started asking questions. Like hold we were and blah blah. but they were all drunk and laughing, and traveling around in a paddy wagon!! We said we were 19, we're 18 i don't know why we said that. And they asked for our numbers and offered to take us out with them. But thats just how all of them are. Its sooo weird. But unless you know people its not so easy being underage, Chicagos not a big underage drinkers fest. Which i really do think the law is ridiculous. If the drinking age were persay 18, then i don't think there would be such a huge   binge drinking   problem for kids when they leave to college. Because if kids are allowed to drink with parents supervision (which in IL its illegal) then the parents can monitor it and teach their kids. That way leaving for college isnt such a huge shock and kids won't get buck wild because they can drink without parents grounding them. Most of my friends parents were real laid back about that issue. All of our parents but one was kind of anal. But im glad i went out a lot in highschool and learned how the manage liquor because now i have no desire to try to get wasted and stupid like the rest of the freshman i see around here falling over themselves. Its really not that bad though. There are just a few dumb ones who arent used to it. I would honestly rather stay in my room during the week and keep up with my classes than drink a beer and get fat for no reason! Ok 6 more minutes of reading my typing. Im sorry for whoever does read this, hope youre not getting too bored. I really do enjoy psychology though, it interests me. I just wish i could have switched into an earlier class because i get out so late every day of the week but fridays!! I took a psychology course my senior year. It was really easy. We had a new teacher so she didnt know much what she was doing, but we still learned. I really wish i took the AP Psychology because they were honestly pretty much always at the same page as us and i heard it really wasnt that hard at all, which i thought the regular psychology was just too easy. At least i could have earned some credit from the AP test. WHoa listening to the fast typing sounds so weird. All of a sudden it just goes rapid fire and real fast! I feel like such a nerd. Im about to go crazy typing for the past 20 minutes straight. Ok someone keeps making noise out there whats going on. I have other work i could be doing right now!!! At least this doesnt have to be edited. That would be awful because i never do the right punctuation when it's not a formal paper. even letters to friends im so lazy. lazy americans. 30 more seconds!! this went by pretty quick though i guess. I still want to eat. I hope i can just fall asleep soon, what movie do i feel like watching? im stuck. ok im done now!!! ",1
"Losing my best friend the day before classes started doesn't necessarily """"enhance"""" my college experience. So much has been circulating through my head. Why did this happen?  She and her sister had so much to live for, and now they are both dead because of a freak accident. A careless mistake took the only two children their parents will know to be their own. In a perverted way I find the situation ironic. Alice had done so many stupid things in her life and come away from them without a scratch, but her sister took a turn too fast and it took both of their lives. I find myself unable to think too much about it recently. I am able to say """"my best friend just died"""" but I haven't found it possible to truly feel the extent of pain that I do. I find myself going through the day forcing a smile here and there, a laugh if I hear something funny, but I have never had such a consistent view of the sidewalk. I am polite to the girls in my dorm, but I am somehow furious that they don't understand my pain. I wouldn't either if someone had come to me with this situation three weeks ago. No one does until it affects you personally. It's like one of those after-school specials on teen-aged depression. I find myself shutting down sometimes and hating the world. If I believed in a god, it would only be one more person to hate and blame for this. I know I need to make new friends but can only wish to see and talk to my old friends, friends that understand. I know I need to get out and do things, but the thought of socializing with strangers frustrates the hell out of me. I find myself going through phases of denial, then rage, then depression, and then denial again. Sometimes I want to put my fist through the wall, other times I want to curl up in a little ball and just stay there for weeks. Sometimes nothing seems important. What good does it do to strive for perfection if it can all be taken away that quickly?   What good does it do to have people close to your heart, if it only hurts that much more when you lose them?  Of course I know the answers to these questions, but recently I've challenged everything I have trusted to be true. ",0
"I wondering about what I should write here but I know that I'm just supposed to write what comes to mind. I just ate a chocolate cookie and now I'm craving some milk. My nose itches. I can see my shadow on the wall in front of me because of the light behind me. This chair is really uncomfortable. I need to buy a pillow to fit in it. Now I'm drawing a blank. Now I'm thinking about studying chemistry after I finish typing. But I don't understand the work, so I guess I should just wait and do the homework after I go to the discussion session tomorrow. My chemistry professor was """"sick"""" today, but the sickout is not supposed to start until tomorrow. Maybe she really is sick. My arm hurts because the edge of the desk is sharp. Now my back itches. It's this darn chair that's making me so uncomfortable. Now I'm wondering if it matters if I type contractions or not. I know that in a proper English paper, I am not supposed to say """"isn't"""" or """"I'm"""" or anything like that. But this is a stream of consciousness so I guess there aren't any rules. I wonder when my roommate is going to get in tonight. I hope she doesn't walk in while I'm still typing this, then it will distract me. But then again, I'm not doing a very good job at focusing on my thoughts right now, anyway. Hmmm. my thoughts. I wish I had not just eaten that cookie. That's unnecessary calories and now I'm thirsty. I wish I could talk to this guy that I like, J. J. He's on a sixmonth float for the navy and I won't get to see him until spring break. But we care a lot about each other and email everyday. I wish I had some music on right now, but I don't know if I should listen to music right now, anyway, because that might mess up my thoughts, also. I hope I like this psychology class. I'm thinking about being a child psychologist. I love children. I want to have two kids. I think I want to have kids before I'm oh, 26. I don't want to die before my kids graduate. Larry King is 74 and his wife is pregnant. That's ridiculous. That's traumatic on the child, I think. I just popped my knuckles. My mom would always slap my hands when I did that in front of her. My nose really itches. Sitting here makes me notice all my aches and pains. My ankle hurts and my arms are hurting because of this desk. I need to repaint my toenails, but I'm so lazy. I want to go smoke a cigarette outside really quickly. But I only have 15 more minutes to type. Wow, only one fourth of the time has passed so far. I just popped my neck. That's probably not too good for me. I'm going to have arthritis everywhere by the time I'm 30. Now I'm trying to get more comfortable so I'm sitting indian style in this little bitty chair. My closet light is on and it's kind of bothering me. I hope I do well in all of my classes this semester. My easiest class is German but the rest I know I will have to put forth a lot of effort to do well in them. But I really think I'm going to enjoy this class. The first day I walked into psychology class last Wednesday, out of all the people in the auditorium, I happened to sit right next to someone I had met the night before. It really is a small world, even thought this is the biggest college in the nation right now. My roommate is a raver. She has all of these rave flyers all over the wall. I've never been to a rave, but I think I might go to one this Saturday. I'm not too pumped up about it, but I think I should at least give it a chance. I just hope I don't get drugged accidentally or something. And also, ravers wear really funny clothing. I'd look funny if I wore """"normal"""" going out clothes to the rave, so I'm going to have to borrow my roommate's clothes. Okay, time is up. ",0
"Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 6. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either.

"I am so overwhelmed that I don't even know what to do anymore. If it isn't one subject then it is another. I finally think that I am ahead in at least once subject and then I look at the syllabus and it says that I am, in actuality, 3 chapters behind. I really don't understand how this all happens. I thought that when I came to college it would be different. I thought that I would get to have a fresh start at things. I thought I would be able to make myself study and get ahead; however, my predictions are proving to be wrong. I am getting further and further behind with every passing day. I have psychology chapters to read, interpersonal communications chapters to read, contemporary moral problems readings, psychology writing assignments, MIS homework and readings. Even if I had all my time to study I still wouldn't be able to get it all done. But that isn't even the issue. Not only do I have all of these things to do, but there are also people asking me every five seconds to go out and enjoy Austin. I don't have time to enjoy Austin. I don't have time to go out, go to sorority meeting, read, write, and keep my sanity all in one day. There just is not enough time. I try and try to manage my time, but it just is not working. I think my only solution is to lock myself in my room and not come out until all of my work for the rest of the semester is done. That is my only solution to my ongoing problem. ",0
"This assignment seemed so easy at first, but now that I am actually writing it, it is hard to find something to write about. I thought that would spend a little time telling you about my first few days at The University of Texas. I come from a very small town, and all my life I have dreamed of living in a very big city. So around my junior year in high school I began looking at different schools and one of them happen to be here. Well I have been to Austin before, but I never got to really go on campus. As I stood on the south mall and saw the capital, I knew this was the place for me. I had a big city and a big school all rolled into one. As the big day got closer and closer, I began to chicken out. I didn't want to leave home, but most of all, I didn't want to leave my family. I wasn't for sure that I could move six hours away not knowing one single person. Everyone told me that I would never make it on my own because I was too much of a """"mommy's girl. """" This is when I knew that it was time to grow up and take another big step in my life. The """"moving day"""" finally arrived and I was scared, but very excited. I decided to go through rush. I needed some kind of activity to keep me busy and this was perfect. My family got me settled in and two days later they were gone. I was very surprised that I didn't shed a tear that day, and two weeks later I still haven't looked back. I haven't even been homesick yet. My roommate is having a hard time, though. We didn't get along at first, but I think everything will work out fine. She calls home a lot crying, and sometimes that is kind of hard on me, but I hope to help her through this tough time. Other than a few small bumps in my road, I am having the time of my life. I will admit all of this is a huge change for me, but sometimes change is just what a person needs. Somehow, everything has just fallen in place for me, and I hope it will remain this good for the next 4 years. ",1
Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 3 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in Austin really do try to chat with other people in Austin alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 6 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in New Jersey so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him Cancun In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in Atlantic City. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 24 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in New York. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see Jina in 2 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at A&M so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish Rich lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at Baylor this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for RTF right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to Europe. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call Jina. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. ,0
"I hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed. I'm such a slow typer. Maybe I should take some sort of remedial typing course. I wonder if they have those at UT. It's weird how stressful this is I have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that I'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. The copying machine behind me is irritating, I wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though I've only been here for ten minutes. Has it only been ten minutes?  Damn, I have to be in here for at least another ten. I'm so hungry, I wonder what I should eat when I'm done with this. For me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food. I don't have much money and I certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen. Whenever I get hungry I have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen. I miss Kinsolving food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student ID I could eat as much as I wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed. I should make more friends who live on campus so I can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food. Wow, my twenty minutes are up. ",1
"     I don't want to go home. I have to take the stupid bus back to campus but I'm too lazy. I'm hungry but I already ate so much I'm gonan get so fat it sucks. no exercise and just food the perfect college experience. dude I'm bored there's nothing to do around here when you don't have a car. I want my car back I miss my baby can't wait until I go back to plano and nadia is pissed off because her stupid phone doesn't have service in her apartment and her apartment sucks. there's no cold water in the shower so I got burned like crazy this morning how am I going to take a shower tomorrow if there's no cold water and the maintenance people didn't fix it yet they're probably going to come tomorrow early in the morning and wake me up and they are screaming like stupid girls and I think shara just got hit in the boob. ha ha how funny. ok its just her leg. gosh we have no life. there's nothing to do aorund here. we just sit here and do nothing and they just scream and we;re going to get fat . I think we should work out. walking around campus is exercise I guess but it doesn't really do anything. I need to work out so bad but I'm too lazy and I don't know wat else to say . I dotn feel like goign to class tomorrow because there's no point in going to chemistry because all his notes are online and he doesn't really expand on it and its so boring and its a one and a half hour class and I want to sleep and I just sit there and stare at nothing its so retarded. I don't get why classes are so boring there's no point in taking a chemistry class if I'm going to be a business major and my friends are being so freaking loud and I can't concentrate and I don't know what I'm typing I'm not even paying attention. there's this girl who got in a car accident and the air bag blew out her eye and she's suing hte company or something I don't know. I think that's really cool. Sort of I don't know I'm runnign out of thigns to say and its only been about 6 mins. how can I do this for 20 mins its impossible I don't think that much. haha that just made me sound really retarded . I think someone in my friends freshman seminar is gay. she's so mean. she doesn't want to hang out with ditzes . don't know how to spell that. there's this grl in psych that wants to form a study group. I don't even know her and I don't my phone just rang and I and we just had a wing dinner and I didn't go and my roommate went to another wing and its so retarded. I don't really want to go and we'll going to get fat. I think my roommate thinks I don't want to stay in my dorm because I haven't been back there in like a week. she might think I don't like her or somthing and my wing advisor doesn't know me she asked my friend told me she asked if she was me. I'm runnning out of stuff to say why are we doing thing. Is there a point . don't htink tat was really smart to say but tats what I'm thinking and this is the assignment so I wrote it. my friends think all I think about is sex alcohol my suicidal lova with and an """"A"""" and they're laughing at nothign its so weird. there are two lesbians on the bed behind me its kind of kinky. gosh this is so retarded. I hope you don't read this because I have no idea wat I'm saying. we are depressed. We realized today thanks to our psych class. all we do is eat sleep do nothing think about sleeping think about partying and doing stuff but we don't and we just sit and eat and do nohting. and htink about classes that we should go to but don't which is really bad since we;re paying for these classes . And now the stupid lesbians are asking each other how many fingers am I holding up and they think I have blonde hair because they found one one the bed. that shows how stupid they are. its probably nadia's because she's a total blonde on the inside and out. and now they're talking about this guys butt and how he wears really tight pants. and how they want their guys friends cloths and now they're imitating how their friends stand this is so stupid I have like 5 mins left and now they want to watch porn. we watched one the other night it was so funny. it was my first time like a few days ago and now they're talking about how we sleep. shara is always squishing me against the wall. And nadia like elbows me. O I have to get tickets for plano tm. Because I'm going back this weekend to see my friend whos leaving for harvard on Saturday so smart. and she just got her cartilage pierced today with my other friend. they're such wusses. They called me and were like freaking out and asking me if it hurt and stuff and I'm like. just freaking do it. And I told them not to call me until they did it. So they did. Took them long enought. gosh 3 more minutes. can't wait until I go to plano. Get my car and probably going to see some friends and hang out and stuff. Stupid dylan piss me off. Gosh why can't he just cooperate once in a while gosh. Its so stupid . I just don't understand him sometimes. nadia wants to put my hair in pigtails and she'll pay me to go to class like tat she said she'll make me dinner but she can't cook if her life depended on it. she made these intstant mash potatoe thngs and it came out wet and dry at the same time and it was kind of grainy and stuff. It was the grossest thing I have ever tasted . and she even screws up instant noodles. she doesn't add enough water and it comes out dry and salty. Ok only 30 mor seconds. just drag it out . Type slower . And now they're talking about their stupid eyebrows and how crappy a wax job it was and she keeps looking at it and tis  ",0
"Right now, I am thinking about my chemistry homework and test. I am very nervous about it and I am worried that I may not succeed to my fullest potential. I am also very nervous and anxious about doing this writing assignment because I have never done this before. I'm also listening to music because it helps me to relax. I am cold and sometimes in makes it difficult to concentrate because my attention is focused on my coldness. I pretty much just look around the room every single day and it helps me to think things through. I also think about the things I have done wrong in my life and how it is that I can go back and correct them. There is this person I love so much with my entire heart, but I don't like him hanging around my best friend. Wait, its more like I don't like for her to hang around him. Yesterday, she just freaked me out because she just came up to us, my friends and I, and she just leaned on my boyfriend. What kind of a friend is she to do that? She knows that I hate for her to be around my boyfriend. And every time she is around him I end up getting mad at him, when, in reality, I should be getting mad at her. There are so many things I want to tell her, but I'm afraid I'll end up hurting her, but I feel she needs to know that it does hurt me a lot when I see her flirting with my boyfriend. She has always been boy crazy, its just that people don't know that. Every time she is around him I get this ugly feeling in my tummy like there is something very wrong. And then today just out of nowhere I told her that she needed to find herself a man, a companion that she could spend time with and stay away from me and my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't say that, but its true. I have always been very insecure about myself, but my boyfriend always tells me that I am beautiful and that he loves me very much. I truly believe him and in my heart that we love each other. Its just my best friend somehow interferes. I figure is she keeps on doing that I am going to let her know how I feel because I don't want to keep my feeling all bottled up inside of me. First of all, I have never been able to deal with my feelings so I pretty much just kept them bottled up inside. I don't know why I did that but I did, up until the time I started going out with my boyfriend. He changed me and the way I felt about myself and I cherish that because he has made a huge impact in my life. I love him so dearly. Anyways, enough about that. I talked to my dad about an hour ago. I call him every day, twice a day in fact. I am what you call Daddy's Little Girl!"""" I am very proud to say that because I love my father very much. He has done so much for me and I wish there was a way that I could give something back. The thing is I used to be able to tell my dad everything, but then something changed. I stopped telling certain things. I guess he kind of saw me as something I wasn't and that made me very sad. In fact, I'm getting teary-eyed right now. It's like my father had this whole other image of the daughter he wanted. I tried to tell him that I was different, but he just wouldn't understand. And now that I am over here at college its like, I wish I could take back every bad thing I did to him. I want to tell him everything that has happened in my life, some good things and some bad. I want him to know all the obstacles and temptations that I have encountered throughout the past few years. I feel he needs to know what his daughter has gone through in her life. A few days ago when I talked to him, I felt homesick. When I hung up with him, I started crying. I poured my heart out right in front of my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend everything about how I wanted to have a better relationship with my father. I want to let him know that I love him so much and that I appreciate him for everything he has done for me. I also miss my mom because she has always done things for me and taught me different things. She is special to me because of who she is. I love her dearly. I miss my little brother and older brother too. I also miss my dog and my cat. They are like my children. They are growing up without their mommy and that makes me sad. I want to be there for them. I love my dad, mom, brothers and boyfriend. I hope they know that they mean a lot to me and that I am lucky to have them as a part of my life. ",1
"I need to learn better time management skills. I'm so glad that I can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. Oh wow! What's up with that teacher? I do feel sorry for her though. I know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. Afterall, I was only on the computer last night for four hours. And I can't believe I allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! But you know what? I figured out that I can get a lot of work done as long as I do it outside of my dorm room. I also figured out why people say   silence is golden.  (Though personally, I don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) Oh my gosh! I totally found a gift from God today! I was sitting in the study lounge in Jester only to stumble upon a study group for 408k. And it was definitely a blessing to finally get into Teranchi's class. I can't believe Theresa and my new friends are in there. Though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. Now I can email Theresa or maybe call up Katherine. (I talked to Katherine today infront of Jesta Pizza and she's taking 408k too. ) I got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 408k homework. The only thing I'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that Coco and Rubes are in this new class as well. I'm not sure if I'm at a stage where I could answer questions as I'm trying to learn them myself. And though it sounds kind of bad, I really need to get an 'A' in 408k. Maybe I can review it this weekend and then I might be able to help them next week. Oh wow, next week! I have tests coming out of nowhere! But today was refreshing considering the fact that I'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. If I can do that in one day. time management here I come! It's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. Well once I'm done with this maybe I'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. Oh yeah, uh huh! I kind of wish I was a speed reader. I wonder if I'd actually get to party a lot more. Dude, screw the parties me and Henna are going to build a fort. How cool is that? That's just too cool! Oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and   POW   there's your fort. Oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! Oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous. ",1
"     Right now I am sitting in my room. my TV ison and I'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. I have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as UT does. Right now I'm here in my dorm room, it kind of smells like B. O. , but I think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up the mess that my room-mate and I have made. The TV is on right now and it's kind of distracting but I'm not going to say anythign because I would consider that rude. Is it bad that I put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. Dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth I really don't care what others think about me. All i care about is what I think of myself, and whether I'm happy with myself or not. At this point I'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. I miss it though. I really don't think that I was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. Is it bad that I don't like school?I know that it's only going to   benefit my future   and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. People don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. It does not cost anything to dream. I'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. I'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. I think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. I set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then I have a total break down. I feel as though I am a failure and I probably will not amount to anything. If you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. I'm sure that by now you can tell that. I'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. I'm very much more comfortable with a 35:1 ratio classes. I'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a   B   I would say   A   but that goes back to my really high standards. Instead of being dissappointed I would rather achieve something that I know that I can probably complete. I think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. I will always wonder if I was ever able to fufill that   A   that i wasnt but never really went for. Does this make me a bad person? I think not. I'm really considering going to a university back home. I'm here in the college of Fine Arts in the Dance department. What can you really do with a BFA in Dance? I'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? There goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. I think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. I'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. I understand that UT isn't a specialized conservatory in the Arts, but if you are going to offer a major in Dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. I am really considering majoring in Psychology with a minor in Dance. The university back home, University of the Incarnet Word, offers a minor in dance and a major in Psychology which sounds like the perfect program. I was also thinking about Mass Media. I was thinking about being a talent agent. I need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I'm not sure what that is right now. ",0
"the channel is tuned to MTV; so there must not be anything better to watch at midday. However, being inside watching crap on the television is better than sitting outside in the Hellish heat. When will the madness stop. I write these words in between my 2D design studio class at the art building in the morning and my psychology class at 3:30 PM. Myb studio class starts at 8 AM, way too early. I write from my apartment in south Austin. I get back and forth between school and my apartment by way of Capital metro. The bus is convienent  but not so convienent. I don't too much like this computer or any computer for that matter. Technology  one day my ruin the human race, we'll have to see. At the moment technology seems to be our best friend, our idle, and to some our lover. That last group of people don't really exsist. Materialism is the Western way of life. This is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. Some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. We need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. I would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. But what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. This is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily  to subsitute for personal contact. We continue to amase ourselves with new toys, but someday we might second guess our advancements. ",1
"Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like UT so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in Hawaii for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to Austin, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase """"Is it hot enough for ya?"""" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 4 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 20's up! Hope it was good reading!  ",1
"my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from Vivian. I don�t want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and I have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while I was writing this I was thinking several different thoughts. I think it's not good that I don�t respect vivian's wishes. I really admire her because she's so old. I am not as nice as I used to be. it's funny to think about  writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why  should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my  into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. I still don't talk that much though because I don't like saying something about nothing. but I guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. James and I have been getting along really well. ever since I fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and I must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what I just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset I was, and I realized how much he  cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because I don't always know what I want. then he makes it apparent that  he's what I want. I miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when I have a really good person already?  he makes me laugh and we love, which is most  important in the person I share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like Sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and I will take it. James just has more than the average Joe. oooo - I've already spent 15 minutes. I should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but I acknowledge my  thoughts, and I can go back and read it in the future to see my development. I want to be a model or an actor. I want the spotlight. sometimes. I want  to be a better gymnast. I don�t want to be judgmental. I want a copy of this. ",0
"It's way too cold in this room to be doing anything that requires the use of my fingers alone. It's like an icebox, but that's good since I'm so hot natured. I bet that the people who type faster write more in twenty minutes than do those who are slow typists. That's almost not fair. We don't get as much of what their mind is thinking simply because their fingers can't go as quickly as their minds. Mine don't either though. I can type pretty fast, but that's because I do it so much. I'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome some day. I've played the piano for almost 11 years now, play the flute, and type constantly. Yikes. But, back to the original point: this isn't exactly fair since it's, well, not the same. That's obvious. I guess nothing in science can be exactly precise. Exactly precise? That's wrong. I wonder if we're supposed to fix grammatical errors AND spelling errors when we're done. I should have set a timer. It's too much trouble for me to keep checking on the little clock at in the system tray. Oh well. We're too lazy these days anyway. Everything's being sacrificed for our own comfort and peace of mind. For example, I have a feeling that technology is a HUGE part of the growing number of cancer patients. A woman I know died last night. She had three children, the oldest a freshman in high school. What a tragedy. It makes you wonder if it's all worth it. Is better living, happier living? Is it even better in the first place? I think it's going to rain. It needs to. Someone said the other day that we're in our fourth year of drought now. I wonder if the drought is due to global warming, due to the depletion of the ozone layer, due to all these """"advances. """" There it is again. We think we're making improvements when in fact we're slowly killing ourselves, or our grandchildren. My Spanish teacher told us that the icebergs are melting, and someone next to me said that they are in fact melting at a rate of one foot per 15 hours (or 15 days?). That's very frightening. I don't know how thick icebergs are, but they won't be around much longer at that rate. My hands hurt now. I complain too much. I whine. :) It's a personality trait. And are these traits inherited biologically or learned? Heh. All this psychology is definitely getting to me. Mr. Pennebaker (or Dr. ?) said that we'd begin to see things from different perspectives; I didn't think it would be quite so soon. I do like the class though. I like the book. Mr. Myers isn't such a boring guy. He put excellent philosophic quotes and questions in with the technical aspects of what we're learning, or, rather, what he's trying to get across. I find it sad that so many people don't care about learning anything. For some, it's all about the grades. We joke in our dorm (that we so lovingly have nicknamed the Virgin Vault since boys aren't allowed on our FLOOR except on weekends) that we're just here for, not our PhD's, but our MRS's. I don't know who came up with that, but it's pretty cute. It's always scared me quite a bit  the idea of living my life for someone else. That's a bit of a clash with my lifestyle though, considering I was the president of our church youth group for two years, but I just couldn't do it for a man here on earth. I don't mean to say that getting married is giving up yourself, but the way some girls talk (about getting their MRS's), that's all they want to do with their life. That IS, to me, giving it up. What about their dreams and goals? Do they have any? Do I? Darn phone. I can hear everything around here. It's getting on my nerves. I lived in Hickville, USA (ok Canton, TX, but it's no different), where there were no people. I lived in the country, where there was no noise. It got so dark, and so quiet, in my room at night, that I could hear the bugs and the dog walk by, that my eyes never adjusted and were able to see. I haven' adjusted to things here yet. I wake up at 3 in the morning for no reason at all, doze back off, and wake up again at four. It's starting to become rather annoying. Normally I have no trouble sleeping. My mom and I are like that. She can sleep through anything, except her kids coming in. I thought it was neat how our class related that to our reticular formation and how it """"learns and remembers"""" certain things. I don't think my reticular formation has anything to do with my waking up at odd hours. Well obviously is does since it's function is to control arousal, but it doesn't """"remember"""" anything that happens at the wee hours of the morning. Hopefully. If so, it needs to get a touch of amnesia. Just a touch. That's my time limit! ttfn ",1
"I remember when asked to do this assignment, I was wondering if someone would actually really want to know my thoughts. I find it kind of hard to just type out all of my thoughts, considering that there are hundreds of random thoughts every minute(or it seems). Phones ringing. cell phones. yuck. Interruptions. I knew that would happen. I don't think I'm capable of having twenty minutes of silence to type something. All I know is that I am really really hot which will probably affect my thinking. I'm naturally a """"hot natured"""" person, and my sister's room is really hot. So hot I'm sitting here sweating and I'm barely moving my body. My room is just as hot though. I'm just hot all the time. I wonder what affects it really does have on me. I know it makes me grumpy sometimes. Especially if I'm hungry at the same time. That's just a bad position to be in hot, sweaty, and hungry. No matter how low I turn are air conditioner, I'm still burning hot. Not to mention our electricity bill that makes me just as hot! But I guess I don't have any room to complain. I couldn't ask for anything more in my life. I have everything I've ever wanted and more! I accidentally meet my boyfriend and he just makes everything even better than it was. He makes me see things that I would have never seen before. He really has made a difference in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you God. I wonder how my mom is feeling? Her surgery was last week, so I'm sure she doesn't feel as bad as she did. Since she was at work a couple days later, I guess she must not have felt too bad. But she is a strong woman the strongest woman I've ever known. I'm proud to say that. Very proud. I guess you kind of' start missing your parents when you leave for college and you're far from home. But I am lucky to have an older sister(who I live with) and I've always gotten to follow behind her, making her do everything first. That's made my life a heck of a lot easier. I do miss my bed and my dogs. Not to mention my home. But I'll be going home soon, so I'm ready to go. I'm ready to introduce my boyfriend to my parents and grandmother too. That should be fun! I know it will go well though. I also wonder if my sister's car will be out of the shop, because I wanted to leave earlier than my sister. She won't get out of class until 4pm and I was wanting to leave around noon. It just takes so long to get there. Grant wanted to ride with my dad when he goes on duty too. I guess I'll leave around noon anyway and not go into work. Ohwell. I'm broke as it is. Why not add to that?!? A couple hours of missed work won't hurt to badly. I do need the money though. I'm going to be eating well that weekend anyway. I'll have 2 meals a day! That's more than I can say now and the food I'll get there is a million times better then what I would have here. You really start to miss the little things about life sometimes it just takes leaving your home for a couple months to do that to you. Years. it's going to' be hard to be away for that long. But I guess it kind of grows on you after a while and you just don't realize or notice it. Hmm I wonder how long I've been typing. I have a lot to read. ",1
what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people. I do miss having my sister in the same city as me she really has meant a lot to me in the past few years and I do wish she was here. but then again I am loving all of my freedom here. have not talked to my mom in a few days and I like it she is not hounding me to do anything. niether is my grandmother. wonder why kellys dad wanted to talk to me. do miss kelly a little but hopefully we can still be friends  wonder what nicole is doing right now. this is the third time I tried to write but the other tow trys I go restless and stop writing. really did not know what to say but now I am just hoping it is not to late for these writing assignments. always seem to wait till the last minute. I cna hear thoughts in my mind but don't know how to put them into words. or which one should I write about first. lunch was good and now I am feeling better because I got something to eat. don't want to work anymmore at eddie bauer because I don't like it anymore and I don't want to work there because I may have something better to do and plus I hope I can find someone to work for me tomarrow so I can go to the training session to be an offical for intermural football. hope my family is doing ok have not heard from them lately. still have ten minutes to write. my mind is completly blank I keep thinking about this book we read last year in english it was written in stream of thought. hope the professer got my email about the brain test to see if a person is right or left brained. nose itches. relly wish we did not have to do this. or at least not for so long. ok sitting like this is not the easiet  ok that is better. morrre comfortable. hope miriam can go this weekend to george carlin have not talked to her in a week and hope everything is going good with her. my neighbors are wierd they play some stange fucked up music. hope I do good on my quiz tommarow I need to study and catch up on my readings. need to know when my calculus test is. and my eco. test. hope the pysc test is not soon. really need to catch up on some reading. hope nicold can everything taken care of so she is not so stressed out. I love spending time with her she is so wonderfull. I think I may love her but then again I still have a wondering eye. I want to meet nwe people and who know the right woman may be out ther but right now I think she is the one. ok good time is up. ,0
"But I can't go to sleep because I have mounds of homework to do. The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend Natalie and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend Mark would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in Virginia, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. Natalie is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 7 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to Mark. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 15 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 20 minutes are up now. SO long. ",0
"Well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, I finally found one. Unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. I can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!)  I am smiling now. I always find irony amusing. They are still pounding next door. What the hell are they doing. HE HEHEEHEH-they just called us the 'Fort Worth Girls'  now that's funny stuff. I seriously have a major stomach ache. It hurts soo soo soo bad. I have been sick for like, three or four days now, I really feel terrible. My insides just hurt and every time I stand up I get dizzy. This computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. Oh well I only have 13 minutes left if I did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, I probably did not do. I kind of feel bad that these people I don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. That's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it?  Everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. I wish my computer was working. It's really, really cute. It's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. I wonder how I did on my French test two days ago. I hope that I did okay. I am seeing all kinds of new people. Isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you don�t know and will never meet?  I think that that is , well to say the least, strange. MY back really hurts. I think , wow, coughing fit, that I will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. I feel so bad now, physically and mentally. I cant wait to go home this weekend. Have my mom take care of me and see my guy that I am kind of dating. I miss him. he says he misses me. I wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. I said that I loved him but I don�t know if I really meant it. I don�t know if I could ever really love anyone. After all, I really don�t even think that I love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. Anyway, he has a boxer dog named Romeo. Very cute. I hate most dogs however. I love my cats. I miss my cats. I am glad I am getting at least this first assignment done. I cant spell for shit tonight. I also manage to talk like a sailor. Oh well. I feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until I leave, I guess I wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. I wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when I leave. That must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, I guess I'll just be as nice as I can be. I really don�t want her to hate me but oh well. Oh hello boy in very very short shorts. That is so Montreal. I am just in extreme pain. I want to work out and I haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. Hello freshman 15, 25, 55. I�m all about gaining weight this year. My mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. Maybe I just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. I want to go to France. I wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. I really must be very very thankful. I am such a terrible person. I really really am mean. ",0
"Today I had my third day of classes at UT. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to A&M so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in Austin, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. ",1
"     I havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time. I do that though, I have a journal and its handy. I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves. Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal. I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. Katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. That reminds me of George, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. George makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. I am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. He is such a confusing boy. I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know. grr. that's a noise I make, I make many of them. I make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. I just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. I wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man I was wrong. I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now I miss them a lot. I was listening to Avril Lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home. and I realized that I have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do. I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said I was an ESTP? I think. anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think. I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap. Jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry. and still when I think about it I get angry at her. why not at him? I don't get that. but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew. I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things. like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just. didn't. and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative. Lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one. I don't know how much they'll cost either. I think $150 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one. I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic. I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but I said that once and she said no way. whatev. I'm tired. I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 I think. I don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks. and I've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job. and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum. I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go. and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go. I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago.

"Autumn will be here soon. I wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city. Down. Down the elivator once again, floor 13, now floor 1. I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath. That single inhale was a day, was a life. Old postcards line my smile. I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess. Heart or head, it doesn't matter. but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching. My little fan is growling at me. It's probably upset that I always leave it on. Let me turn it off really quick. Ok. Done. I heard a door shut. The people in my dorm are an infestation. I cannot STAND them. I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same. Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look. Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. I LOOK at the people. They make me laugh! We are so strange. I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls. People who try to look sexy. People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. People look at me too. What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. My heart races when they do that. It's kind of a love. I love them for that one milisecond. I understand them for one lapse of time. But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me. That's my job. I absolutely hate being in here. Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books. entertainment is all I need on media terms. We should kill our TV's though. As one of my favorite bands says """"I wish the world was flat like the old days"""". I have to say: Amen. We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking. ",0
"As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 12 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK1) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at Gregory. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough. I have sympathy for them. I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK1 gives me a headache. I probably will never wear CK1 again. I hope all my friends and family are doing well. I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye. ",0
"     So this is my first writing assignent for college. I keep forgetting that I am actually in school, and not on vacation of some sort. I just got out of bad and am havign a lot of feelings right now, all about non-important things, like boys. I am mad I lost my earing last night, mad that i still have feelings for my ex-boyfriend in a way, and mad that I don't know what to do about people here. It is just a totally different experience then anything else and I wonder when I will get used to it. I think i also need to learn how to type better and use punctuation! IMs never need punctuation or capitilization. or even correct spelling. Roommate is still gone, staying with her boyfriend, and its ok because i like him better now. Before I thought he was boring adn not as nice as David, but he is quite goofy and is always nice to em, though soemtimes I get the feeling its because he feels that I am a dork who just goes wherever Jerry goes. People kept telling us that rooming together would be a problem, but so far we have only had issues once, right before school started when we were spending way too much time together, and that was not good. That one night she left to stay at Steven's and walked out saying, have fun, made me want to punch her, because obviously I was just going ot be hanging out in the room, alone. Now that I am meeting people on my own out of   the group  , its much easier to do things and feel like I have a life. I still need to meet more people in my hall, and in classes, but most of them are so big that just being there I feel like not really participating. Going to the lake on labor day was quite an adventure, and one I am glad I had without Jerry. and jumping off the cliff was one of the coolest things i have done in a while. It also made me glad that no other girls went off the 50 foot cliff. I like doing things that girls normally don't do in these group situations, like the firebreathing and the shotgunning a beer. . but having done it once, I don't need to do that again. but I stil almost beat that guy when we did it, hehe. I don't understand why people drink beer- it tastes horrible and I have heard that after about 2, you don't taste it anymore. . but that means you have to drink 2 of them and then you must be getting pretty mindless to keep drinking somthing you don't like in the first place. Then it seems more like somthing people do to be   cool  , or whatever else people think they need to do. I have seen less of that in college. people seem more laid back in general about all sorts of things, but then again, there are still sorority girl types out there. I can't get over my dislike of the idea of sororities, probably because I don't know many girls well who are in them. I have been mostly meeting the guys in Steven's fraternity, and they are all nice, and not all mindless drinkers (mostly c. s. majors or engineers) and I am gald that i got to meet them all. . but they are all older then me. I used to love to tell people how young I actually was because they were always shocked, saying things like,   oh, you don't look/ act   however old I was at the time. My birthday was just over 2 weeks ago, and that sort of blows my mind because of all the things that have happened so far. Its like every phase of my life is separate from everything else that has happened in my life. its hard to even think of middle school anymore, and even freshman year of high school seems like someone elses life. Its also hard to belive that everything with Jason just happened last month, that we broke up in August and now its just September, barely, but it still feels like forever since it happened. OH CRAP. the phone just rang and it was some one asking me to go to the co-op with her- yeah! no more looser-dom! But then somehow I hit somthing that made the site go away and now that I'm back ,the timer has started all over again. Well, I think I have about 10 more minutes. So, all I have accomplished today was sleeping until noon, which has to be my sleep limit, I NEVER used to do that. and now I guess I will go to the co-op to return a book and hang out with Yashoda, and then. I guess I have to get ready for my   date  , I guess thats what it is. I am not looking forward to it anymore after last night, I don't know were we are going or even if I want to go anymore. So yesterday Jerry was telling me about her comparitive values seminar, and how they had to come to class with somthing to share that they were   absolutely certain   about, somthing not-ohysical that they could prove. jerry said that   I am me  , and that seems certain enough to me. . but another girl said that she is a woman, and they just picked that apart in class because really, how can you be certain of that? I think the point of that class is to weird you out and show you that nothing is certain. . so as if you werent already clueless enough at this point in your life, now you have some class where they tell you nothing is for sure. Besides physical things, what makes me a woman? The way I act? Why do I act the way I do? Those questions could go on forever with no answer, but it really made me think about the whole gender thing. Possibly I am a gay man trapped in a woman's body? Oh, the lady in the cafeteria-place today called me   sir  . I can't believe that happened, she said she couldnt see me around the sign or sneeze guard or whatever was there in front of her but. she called me sir! Brings back not-good thoughts of Jordan thinking it was funny to call me   butch   and Dawn telling me that I am   just one of the guys  . yah, maybe some gender issues here. I am a woman! Even if its not totally certain according to all this deep philosophy stuff, I AM a woman, and I happen to like boys, and I am pretty sure I don't resemble a guy (even with my upper-body buff-ness from swim team) but it is still a sore topic for me. It doesnt help that I am tall. oh! another phone call. I think my time should be up but the timer is all off, so I will say that this is 20 minutes and that is that! ",1
"Okay so I was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. This was something that I really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and I seemed to have noticed a difference. I first tried it out on reading a book. I realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what I was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. When listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and I kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. I am listening to a dj named Paul Oakenfold who is a trance dj, and even as we speak I can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what I am writing. Yesterday, last night, actually I was doing some reading and I started to first listen to hip hop and I kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because I know a lot of them. I ended up spending about 30 minutes and I got through about 12 or 13 pages which is incredibly slow. After that I decide to try out some trance. I actually used to always listen to trance last year when I would read or study because I always helped my expand my mind when I was either designing things, reading, or writing. So when I was reading I noticed that I was much more attentive to what I was doing and got a lot more than 13 pages read in a 30 minute time period. As of right now I am trying out this trance thing again. The funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. The TV  is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the TV  but to the work that we need to get done. After thinking about this right now I am at 9 min 30 sec and I have already written a lot. I believe that if I would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. Another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that I am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music?  I mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together? Or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body's response system that makes you feel all numb inside. Could this be another type of an anesthetic, but instead of a shot, gas, or gel, could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic?  Who really knows. But anyway that I am sure has been looked at for a long time. I really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me. But right now I really don't know what else I wamt to talk about because I am out of time. ",0
"As I write this paper I am still filled with the stress, but know gets much worse. I have been hired for a job, and I am still pondering if it is possible to handle both a job and school. I guess you can call it greed about money, but I need it to stay here. I am also thinking that this to easy. College is supposed to be hard, and yet my hardest class is my Microeconomics. With all this stress I still have the one thought in my head. What if I was not born?  Would it be less stressful?  This is not a suicide letter, but the thought of me not being born always enters my mind. Is life nothing but work and school, or is it much more. I do not know I guess I am always thinking about the negative aspects of life. The world is not like peaches and cream. Tonight is a busy night. I have to do my laundry, and do some reading. I guess I am psyching myself out. And yet I am alone in a city that is surrounded by my burden. I do not know what the point of writing this. I guess I need the grade, but even then I wish why I can not be truly happy about my life. To think that some where around the world somebody is happy, and it makes me sick to think about that. Life is not fun and games it is a weary journey that must be gone through, but I can't rest my feet until I am done and gone. ",0
"Right now I'm writing about the things I am thinking of. I just got my hair cut and now I'm drinking a coke float. which I probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 15 is a big thing these days. my boyfriend just called and I like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes I just wonder like if I'm doing the right thing. actually I wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived. now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 50 years - that's a long time. I'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents. today I went and bought some clothes, which I probably should not have because I have a lot already. this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this. today we had a parade in my home town. yeah I'm home again. and it was cool. Kyle is a senior. I wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie. today is the football game, I wonder if Texas will win. LaGrange lost really bad last night - Hahira their not as good as they think they are. mom is sleeping and she snores a lot. dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting. coolcherrychick has just signed on. cool. lol wow my hair is really short. man I can type faster than I thought I could, I guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! I can't believe I found pants long enough for me at Bealls, that like never happens because I have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal. now coolcherrychick has just signed off. why do I like coke so much? I mean I don't drink it that often because I don't allow myself to, but I do enjoy it a lot - I guess the caffeine. I have problems spelling. this coke float is super good. thank god he stopped. ha-ha I just wrote stuffed before I erased it, anyway with the window. my hair is really cute, at least I think so. for once I'm not cold, its amazing. rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least I will have a coach forcing me to work out and I can identify with a team. I wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, I mean I can use big words, but I really don't think in big words. my cognate. however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that. I hope rhea's oh regina's home, I hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, I don't think she really tried very hard but I mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible. regina and laurie just got home and as I'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something I don't know and I feel bad but I have to do this assignment. oh well I hope they didn't think I was being rude. this is kind of hard because I think so much faster than I type. mija just ran with laurie. she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but I guess I do to when I don't take a bath for awhile. I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it. Kevin called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 50 something but looks a lot younger. like 35 or 40 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general. I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer. I like that song and I can't believe a 14 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself. Kyle is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it. I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it. I mean I can jump high, but I can't hit hard. wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, I am glad I am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow I really have problems typing. today I changed in the car, that was really not fun I should have planned it better. oh well I guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking. usa wow I'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices. shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time. it would be so nice to be rich. I need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol. breathing is a good thing. laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun. my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.

"Oh no!  I wasn't ready!  Oh well!  This seems weird to me to write what I think. I think very random things. I really like school here but miss my family. My roommate is going out tonight and she looks cute. It is some kind of formal for a frat. I don't like the frats here. The boys make me feel uncomfortable. A lot of guys do that though. They don't seem to notice me in any way. It is kind of weird. All this time I thought it would be better once I got to college and the guys would notice me, but nothing has really changed. They all still see me as a cute friend girl. But I am beginning to accept and like that. I am beginning to kind of like being   one of the guys  !  Oh poot! I forgot to put an away message on my Instant Messenger. I hope no one IMs me. Maybe I should do that. It will only take a sec. Okay!  Done!  It feels like time is passing so slowly as I type. Maybe it is because I want this to be over with. I feel like I type a lot slower than I thought. At least I use all my fingers and not just my pointers. I feel sorry for the people that do that. If I were to keep thinking in this way, will whoever reads this think I am a huge loser?  Am I a loser anyway for doing this assignment almost 2 weeks before it is due?  Wait, I think it is two weeks and one day away from being due. Or 2 weeks and 2 days!  I think. Maybe I don't even know the due date and am just getting ahead. I think that is right. I just scratched the scab on my arm and it hurt. I don't know how it got there. I feel like such a little kid!  I fall all the time and have bruises all over my arms and legs and scabs on my elbows and knees. I am such a clutz!  I need to adjust my screen because it is getting hard for me to see what I am writing. I hope I am not misspelling any words. I am not the best speller, and when I am typing it gets worse. I always spell because-   BECASUE  . It is terrible. I think people rely on computers too much to fix their mistakes for them. We now even can talk on the phone through the internet and stuff. That can help us fix relationship problems. My roommate is putting lotion on. She makes me laugh a lot!  Actually it isn't hard to do. But the funniest person is my brother in law Jeremy. He is so hilarious. All he has to do is say one word and I will bust out laughing. I wish that I could be that funny. Laughing makes people feel good!  My cousin used to say that it makes you live longer to laugh. I wonder if she is right. She laughs even more than me!  My roommate just sneezed and I laughed because she did!  See!  I just had to go back and fix because, because I spelled it wrong!  Anyway!  Back to my cousin. She has become my best friend. (or at least one of them)  I miss her a lot. Arlington and Austin are far from each other and since she is only 16 it is hard for her to be allowed to come down here without her parents throwing a fit. They probably are worried about me. I sent them an email today because my aunt is a teacher at Mansfield's SUmmit, and she used to teach at Grapevine High School, and I met a guy that had her as a teacher. He goes to South West Texas. That is only 30 minutes away!  I am developing feelings for him. I went out with 11 boys on Friday, and I was the only girl. Ryan, the boy, was there too, and we hung out a lot of the time. He is really a great guy. I want to get to know him better. I saw him last night at our friend's house that introduced us, and he barely talked to me. I tryed to talk to him, and he was, I think, trying to talk to me, but this girl named Cassidy kept interfering. She goes to OSU and came down for the weekend to see all her   best friends  . Whatever. She kept keeping him from talking to me. He told me to follow him around at one part. He made me laugh a lot. I really like it when guys make me laugh. Another thing is that he makes me feel comfortable around him, like I have known him for a long time. That is another thing I look for in guys. Being comfortable and laughing is a good combination of things to be. It makes me happy. My roommate is talking to her sister right now, and it makes me miss my sisters. They are both older than me and I miss them. I actually hung out with them all day today, so I don't know why I miss them. I love them a whole lot. It is amazing how when we grow up, we all become closer even though we are 3 and 6 years apart. I guess growing up makes everything between my family better!  Blake Felix is not cute and Sarah is crushing on him and she made fun of me. Jake Anderton is such a liar and a big jerk. I don't know what made me think I would have fun with him. HELLO!!  Differing personalities TOTALLY!!  I like musicals, for instance, and he doesn't know a thing about them. I want to be an actress one day, speaking of musicals, and I would love to do a show on Broadway!  I want to go to LA, though, first. That would be awesome to make a movie. Courtney and her sister are even getting closer like my sisters are. WOAH!  That was totally off subject. I think it is because I am now writing this and listening to Courtney talk. That is hard to do. Kind of like listening to music and studying. It is hard. TIME UP! ",1
"I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book Babbit, by Sinclair Lewis. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of George Babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like Kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but Kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. I really like Joseph COnrad, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, William Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about Freud and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. ",1
"     The green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today. I really hope it doesn't rain again today because I got really wet yesterday. That ticking closk is really annoying me. I never really notice it until I I have to go to work though. Theres my sisters Harry Potter book. I wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good. I really hope it is. I have no idea why my Dad is so into trains right now, hes been collecting them everywhere. I think this is his midlife crisis hobby. We had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called Rusk just to ride a steam train. It wasn't really worth it. I wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did. That French toast i made this morning really wasn't very good. I left a funny taste in my mouth. I should probably go brush my teeth, they have syrup all over them. I am so tired I shouldn't have stayed up as late as i did last night. Putting my thoughts on paper is really hard. I have no idea what to write.  My arm hurts. I think its because i haven't streched it since volleyball season last year. I hope the team does well this year. I'm pretty confident they will. They have some really good players this year. i wonder how good of a player Mr. Pace's daughter really is. she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do, considering. The new coach seems to be aa good coach though. I really hope she's able to build up a strong team. I wish that I could play for one more year. volleyball is so much fun. I wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball. That would be a whole lot of fun. Dawn alread y said she didn't want to do it. She is so unmotivated sometimes. I think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer. My hand is getting tired. Its probably just because I haven't typed hardly anything for the entire summer. I really want to take a typing class somewhere so I would learn how to type a lot faster. That would make papers a lot easier to write.   ",0
"I have no idea where to start on this thing, and I forgot to look at the clock 1:09, okay, I feel better now. This has got to be the longest version of Hotel California ever, it takes them about 3 years to start singing. I need to go to the grocery store, need to get some milk and hot dogs. the essentials. Could probably just run to the 7-11, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion. Should just by a new one, but don't know where I'd put this one in this tiny room. Dorms suck. Living it up at the Hotel California. Man, my typing skills have gone downhill, it's sad. I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 10 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 50. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised Jenna hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love Lenny Kravitz. this song brings back memories of 7th, no 8th grade. I think I liked 8th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s. I should really go find Jennifer and reminesce. Don't think that's spelled right, whatever. Haven't talk to Opie in awhile, she's probably off trying to be the next Jodie foster. psycho. Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy. Rachel will probably be back in my spot. That would suck. My foot's asleep, three minutes to go. The computer better not crash now. I really should clean this room up, that's probably on the list of things to do. I wonder what song is next. Oh, that's the end, good my time is up. 1:29, yeah. ",0
"I don't really want to go to my BA101 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call Sheetal so we can go study at the PCL or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 1301 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if Nancy has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at UT has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA101 I will go to eat at Kinsolving and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. Stephanie should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for Sarika, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA101 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. ",0
"my room seems nice, I mean it's not like home or anything, but the privacy compensates. I wonder what mom and dad are doing. Hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia Juany    but anyways, my roommate is making noise by the mirror. it's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and I turned it on. I simply left downstairs for 5 minutes and I come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel, just surfing the channels when I wanted to watch the my show. anyways now that that is out I can continue. yeah, my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator. I went back home last weekend. I bought a couple of books which I want to read, but seem to have no time to do it; I have a ton of class reading. well, biology seems like it's going to be easy, chem. a little work, nutrition just pay attention during class. c. c a lot of reading. my roommate always eats late at night and I'm trying to help her get better eating habits, but in my opinion, she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight. her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines. this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me, like I want to talk on the phone with them. I don't like talking on the phone. I should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless I'm doing absolutely nothing; I don't like to get distracted especially if I'm watching tv, or doing some kind of school work. she (roommate) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are . 75 cents     yeah, I haven't done any laundry since I got here but I can still manage with what I have in my closet. I really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers. well, it would help if I got all my book first. I'm missing one coincidently it's psy, I went yesterday and they have no more. hopefully by tomorrow they do I need to go over there after class. thank goodness I only have one class tomorrow. I have to finish my ch and c. c homework, shower, check mail, write my tuition check. red robin,  I worked there an entire year last year,  too much work for not enough money. my roommate was my superior there, but I worked as well as she did ,and many of times better (simply because the team liked me better)      it's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her. don't get me wrong my roommate is a great girl; I've known her since 5th grade. I like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what's on her mind. yeah, they're calling her up to ask her to work this weekend, I'm not working there until the break. yeah, this time around I'm registering for my classes early, so I don't have closed classes like this semester    but I have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester, having to move a lot of things around    well time is almost up    so later            ",1
"I love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since I last wrote my entry. I have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. I had English today at 9 am and really enjoy it, I like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which I like also--more of a high school feel. It is my birthday tom. and I am not excited about it because I have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. All my friends are already talking about where to live next year and I am not sure why. They all say that things fill up so quickly. I got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, I guess I had assumed we would live together next year. College is so much money. I feel like at every corner I turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. I am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, I am doing some babysitting though. Kids are my life, I do not know what I would do without them. I was thinking the other day, my dogs back in Houston--do they know I am gone? It made me sad to think they have no clue if I am OK, I am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. My phone is ringing but I think I will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, I have gained a lot of weight and I can feel it, I am slower and get more tired quickly. I wonder how it will feel to 19! Almost 20, I feel like just yesterday I was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times I miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but I miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. Right now my friend Connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. She is thumbelina, so cute. There is a vacuum going on in the background, I really need to shave my legs. and lay out. My brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, I miss him also but sometimes I wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. I want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. He already has two. I am a theta and I really like them. Tonight I am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as I do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. My e mail is broken and I am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. They are so slow. Now my friend has left the room, I feel like I can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and I am not hungry. I am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at ACC and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, I think the TV show Jerry Springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. I love beanie babies, they are so cute, but I do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!!  I love the summer and am sad it is almost over!  My 20 minutes is up so bye bye. ",0
"I hate computers. I think I hate them because I do not understand them. This assignment is hard because I am trying not to think about the assignment and just write about what is in my head. Why is this just continuing on one line?  Am I doing this wrong?  Should I fix the grammatical errors that I make?  I feel stressed I have only been here for a couple weeks. What could I possibly be stressed about?  I need to talk to Ashton. I need to talk to him tonight. This is a time in my life where I am supposed to try new things, meet new people, further my education. I do not need a serious boyfriend now. Why is he so nice?  Did he see this coming?  Is he trying to make this harder for me?  No. What am I talking about?  He is always this nice. He is such an incredible guy. Bad timing. This always happens to me. I will not miss experiences in college like I did in high school because of some guy. I need to see what it is like not having some guy around me all the time. Josh might be right. I might be afraid of being by myself. I will talk to him tonight. I probably will not. How can I possibly be mean to someone who is so wonderful?  He won't understand. I know this is the best thing for me. I need to learn how to operate e-mail. I want to start sending mail to my brother. Josh better come to Austin to see me soon. My sister better come soon, too. I cannot believe that the one weekend I really want to go home (homecoming) I have to stay here and be formally initiated into my sorority. It is Haley's birthday. I am so Jealous that Meredith gets to go see everyone and I will not. We have been talking about how fun that weekend will be since homecoming last year. This sucks. Everyone will be home. I wish the girls in this dorm were a little more considerate. They see me studying in here and they are still so loud. I hope I do not do the same thing. I am having so much fun here, yet I am still stressed about maintaining my friendships with my best friends from home. I hate it that one of my best friends is here in Austin. It puts such a damper on our friendship. I am just so busy right now. I never realized how much time this sorority would take up. Am I neglecting one of best friends?  Does she resent the fact that I am making new friends?  I love that girl. With everyone else, we know why we haven't seen one another. Ashton. What am I going to do?  I am having to talk myself into doing this. I know I need to see what it is like to date other people. I think Richard has something to do with this. I think Ashton is so wonderful because Richard was so horrible. I wonder what Richard is doing. I wonder if he is ended up going SAE. I wonder if he has a girlfriend. I wonder if he is a possessive weirdo to her. Why do I care?  No, Ashton is wonderful. Am I going to regret this?  What if he starts dating someone else and it breaks my heart. I need to do this. I am so far behind. I need to learn a little about time management. I think I am getting sick. I keep feeling like I am about to sneeze. I need to quit smoking. I would like to smoke right now. Why do I think when I am stressed that a cigarette will make me feel better. I should talk my father into buying me a computer for Christmas. I think that would be a good idea. I am going to be here for a while. I really need to start thinking of what it is that I want to do. Am I taking pointless classes?  Do I always ask myself questions?  I was really insulted by those stupid papers that basically said that I was in the lowest percentile of students at this university. I have to do well this year. I need to get my act together. It is so hard to just sit in my room and study. I should probably spend more time at the library. What could I be distracted by there?  I am asking myself too  many questions. I need some sleep. I think I am going to sneeze again. I hate that feeling.           ",0
"I am so upset with myself today. I am so far behind on my study god I hope I don't fail. I don't want to fail my mom. She would be so disappointed in me. I can't do that to her. Class isn't what I thought it would be. And all the reading god, it is so annoying. Brooke is pissing me off so much. You would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and Lex out of her life. No she has to come down every weekend and steal Lex away and get drunk. Oh man that is so fun. Yeah right. I mean Lex is my friend too. I can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 7:00 every night. Then you got homework and early classes. God I just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without Brooke calling every ten minutes. You have to share Lex, Brooke. My roommate Jana is really cool. She has a great outlook on life. She takes things as they go. I wish I was more like that instead of worrying about everything I do and what people will say. I mean being a girl at UT you have to look pretty to get a guy. So number 1 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. Next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. And why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. Sorry I'm not into that. I can have fun without that stuff. Jana has this guy she is in to. Supposedly he is a charming jerk. He lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. That is all she talks about. I wish I could find a guy too so we could trade stories. Me and Jana are not from Austin and decided to drive around today to the mall. Boy was that stupid. I was so scared I thought we would never find our way back. God I can't get over the fact Brooke would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. I think I will tell her to stay in Arlington and make her own friends, I mean I made mine. I am so bummed. I keep thinking I am going to fail out of college. My brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. He was salutatorian in high school and I was only 8th. I am afraid I won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. I mean I have a Kinesiology major. That is a joke to everyone I know. I haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid I have a test or quiz tomorrow. I am going to have to cram. I just don't want to fail. I am so scared about this. I know I will fail if I don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. I'm too lazy and tired of school. I just want to go out to the Real World"""" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. It would be a lot more easier. I figure if I just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is I don't have any concentration in me. I feel like I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). I really don't but it feels like it because I lack so much energy and motivation. I hope school is okay tomorrow because I do not want to have a bad day. I hate bad days they make me sad. ",0
"     Right now I am sitting here. The washing machine is very loud. My nose is  really stuffy. I really like that band brandston that I saw the othernight. they were  really nice and really cool. I can't wait until I get to hang out with steven. I really  missed him while I was in austin. stupid nose itches. I don't understand why randi  and I seem to not be as close anymore. Its kind of sad. She has been my best  friend for 5 years. Its really ironic that steven is now my best friend. who would  have ever thought? """"Don't come crying back to me. When you're lonely and all out  of love"""" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly  causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific  song. Its a very nice song. Very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting. I  can't believe that I still have 17 minutes left to type. Its usually very hard for me to  type stream of consciousnes, I've tried it before in a humanities class for some  reason. I can't ever seem to really put what I'm thinking on paper. that's why its  hard for me to write or keep a journal. I even lie to myself on paper. I wonder why. I also wonder why Mikey is the way he is with me. I can't believe I ran into him last  night. He completely ignored me. That really hurts my feelings because we were  really close. At least I thought so. I really need closure. I hate myself for not  hating him. My nose is running again now. It's getting in the way of my typing. I  am so stressed out right now about biology. The house is completely silent right  now except for the washing machine. The dorm is never this quiet. I think maybe  that's why I like the dorm. Because its loud. Ow, I just hit my ear that I just pierced. Its really sore. The pain only lasts for a split second though. Its not as hot here in  amarillo as it is in austin. the weather here for labor day is perfect. I think I will go  and walk my dogs. I just sneezed again. I am sick of sneezing. Stupid allergies. I  need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework. I also need to read  chapters 3 and 4 for psychology. I am behind. I am so worried about my  biology. I don't understand it and because of that I am not focusing as hard on my  other classes. However, government should be easy. I've taken that class before. Psychology is fun, but I really do not know what to expect on my tests. I don't know  how I will do in that class. I thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy  at all. someone is getting ice from the refrigerator. I can hear it. wow, does my  mind really jump this much?  that's really interesting. I guess I am sort of truly  typing in a stream of consciencous. am I even spelling that right?  I usually can  spell. I feel like everyone else at UT is smarter than I am. I am not used to that.  I'm always the smartest. No one here knows my reputation. no one knows that I  am smart. But maybe I'm not smart. Maybe I am just lucky. My little puppy shinobi  isn't eating anymore. Maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday. I really  missed my dogs. zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me. He licked me  all over. I love dogs so much. but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't  show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people. other dogs like me  more. just my luck. I had to explain what I am doing to my mom. this is all  interesting. the fan is on now. my legs are cold. I think I'm sick. I want to listen to  my new cd again. I can't believe that I got to talk to further seems forever and get  put on the guest list for another show of theirs. too bad I didn't go. I can't believe  mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them. oh well, he is probably just  tying to be """"emo"""" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with  the people  that he holds up on a pedestool. why did I ever date a guy like that?  and why am I still so attracted to such a stupid jerk?  I hate people like him. why  has he changed?  my stomach is hurting now again. I don't like being sick. I need  paper in order to print. and a USB cable. I hate that my printer doesn't work in my  dorm. I brought it for nothing. I bought some new cartridge too. its all a waste. I  can't return it. well for thanksgiving or something I will bring the printer home and  have my dad try to fix it. being home doesn't feel like home really. just feels like I'm  visiting. which is really what I'm doing. my nose is itching again, I think I am going  to sneeze again. I feel like I've been typing for 2 hours. someone just opened  something. I don't hear my dogs anymore. I wonder what they are doing. my  stomach is still hurting. the air conditioner just turned on. I heard it. I don't usually  hear these things. that's strange. my eyes are drooping. I'm tired. I haven't slept  well for a couple days. Why does he hate me?  I really wish I would just be brave  and confront him. I always say I'm going to, and I really think that I am going to, but  then I chicken out and if anything, I am extremely nice to him only to have him  ignore me. further seems forever was so good the other night. the energy  around me at the concert was so good. I was up in front. that was great. the new  lead singer was great. I need to go to more places like that in austin. I just typed  that sentence with my eyes closed. I am really falling asleep. my parents are  talking. I can hear them. my dad is selling my car. that makes me sad because I  really like my car. Even though I am getting a better car. ",0
"I don't know how other people (freshmen) are coping with this new transition from high school to college; I feel stress out. Hmm. maybe I'm not so completely at ease like I had claimed earlier. I suppose that I am at ease at this moment is because I don't have any class to go to for hours, and that I think I am at ease right now, is because this is the second week of classes. However, I'm still stress, very much so. (I feel like I'm rambling on and on here. ) I am so very much relief that I have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments. I like to try to do things ahead of time so that I won't be in any jams later on. Besides, what with the way my schedule is set, I have to budget my time wisely. Moreover, I am worried that I won't be able to get high grades as I did when I was in high school. Everything in college is so very different and challenging. Sometimes, I feel as if I can't keep up with other people. I admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them. I just can't do that. I'm the type that has to put in """"extra work"""" so that I can keep up with them. I'm not saying that I'm stupid, gosh no! I believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways. Hmmm. there is one thing, rather, one small minor fear  that I just can't seem to overcome: fear of animals, especially dogs. Well, I took the pretest and in there, it had asked me questions about animal phobia. I really want to know what these fears mean, which brings me to another thought. I always have questions, such questions that are so detailed some people called it """"stupid questions. """" I always find myself having questions about everything. I guess  I'm just a curious person. Hmmmm. I guess this is enough typing for this assignment. I can't think of anything else to write about. Who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment, I'm sorry it isn't anything that is as exciting as you'll like it to be. ",0
"Although I have waited until the very last minute to start this assignment, it was totally out of my control. I've been dealing with getting my laptop and setting up my Internet for about two weeks now. The Ethernet card was finally put into today, but only after harassing the front desk of my dorm about twenty times. So, now I'm connected to all my friends who either moved or do not go to UT. But, even though I might be connected, I barely ever get any real information about their lives from them. One of my best friends moved to College Station to go to school. It might be only a twohour drive, but I haven't seen her in almost a month. That is really hard when before she left we were seeing each other almost every day. And, I don't feel I'm making enough of a conscious effort to keep in touch with her. Maybe I think that if I don't speak to her then I won't miss her. I've also been overwhelmed with the changes of moving away from home, meeting new people, and getting adjusted. So, I might just be extremely busy right now, too much on my mind. I've wanted to graduate high school and be on my own since I was about twelve. I've always been extremely responsible and independent, not really seeing the need for strict authority, parents, teachers, etc. So, I figured moving out of my house and into a new environment would be a breeze. I've adjusted all right. I do my homework, don't stay out late on school nights, and go to all my classes. Psychologically though is a different story. I never realized how much I'd miss my parents, and only now do I really appreciate what they do for me. I got sick about the second week I moved into my dorm, and all I could think about was how I wanted my mom to take care of me. Me, miss independent just wanted someone to cook soup for her and tell her what kind of medicine to take. Also, dealing with campus size has been kind of hard. I grew up in a small town and went to a small high school where I practically knew everyone. I am living with a friend from high school, so that's made it a little easier. But still, I don't feel like an individual anymore. I feel like one in a huge crowd, which is exactly the case. Especially in this class. How do you get to know people when you sit by someone different every day and there are over five hundred people that walk through the doors? That's almost three times my graduating class. Five hundred is half the town of Dripping Springs. It's so different, and yet I'm only thirty miles away from home. I also haven't really found much to get involved with. I'm not into sports, and at this point I haven't really experienced anything that I love doing and want to pursue. The only thing I've really done as a group is me, my roommate, and a friend from one of my classes went to a Pill Start class. Which is what it sounds like, starting birth control. That's another thing, I got to this class, yet I'm not sexually active, and I feel like such a minority here in college. I went to the class as a preventative measure. You now, a just in case it happens when I'm drunk or not thinking straight, or maybe even if I get into a relationship where I actually trust my partner. I have this huge overwhelming fear of pregnancy, and I think that's stopped me from being intimate. And, I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Yeah, it has kept me from having sex, but I'm also in a state of fear about the issue. I'm worried my sister, my friends, anyone and everyone is going to get pregnant and that scares me. I worry so much about other people, and I feel responsible for them. Like, I'm always offering to take so and so to go get birth control. Then, they look at me like I'm a freak and explain to my how there's really no way they can get pregnant. I mean, they are using condoms. And all I can do is look at them and think """"OH My God!"""" How can anyone be so nonchalant about such an important issue? If I ever got pregnant my life would change so much. It's way too much to even think about. And, I don't ever want to have to make the decision of if I should keep the baby. I love children so much, but I don't want them now, when I can't provide for them or give them the life I know they deserve. But, I don't really think abstinence is the answer either. I think that at some point I'm going to just have to get over this fear. I don't have a problem with sex; I just have a problem with all the scary things that can result from it. Ten minutes of pleasure is not worth disease, death, or even a new life (right now). ",0
"I come from a small town of 5,ooo people and everyone knows your business. I have 4 sisters and 0 brothers. I am the 2nd to the youngest person of all 5 girls. All 3 of my older sisters are married  except for my youngest one. She is only in the 6th grade. My father is a elementary school teacher and my mother is a pharmacist technician. I love my parents to death and they have been for me continuously. I respect with all that I have to offer and much more. I hope to do well in school, not only for myself but for them as well. I hope to go to medical school one day and eventually be doctor. I have high expectations of myself and I hope to accomplish all of my goals. I know that I am the only one that can mess up my life and my goals. I have this roommate, and I worry about him every now and then. He seems to know what he wants but, he keeps on screwing up. I have this friend who has to do homework. She would have been done by now but  she is a huge procrastinator. I can be like that too, but I work better under pressure. A lot of people tell me that I do not have common sense, but I really don't give, because I don't care. As you can see, I am writing whatever is coming to my mind. I wish I could just type the same word over and over again. For example,---- say etc. Sometimes I wonder what the world will be like in about 20 years. if it is even going to be here or if we are not. Huh. About what. Oh man hey one of you'll do me a favor, nah I need a big favor. I am not going to pull your finger. No for real I need you'll to do me  a favor. It depends. Will you'll go pick up Erica?  Yah, if you give me few bucks. Well, I really don't know what to type anymore, I have been typing a whole bunch of crud and now my twenty minutes are up or at least almost up. I have paused for a while, but that is only because it is hard just writing what ever comes to your mind. so I won't lie, but It has been an experience. ",0
"     Yaaaaay. I'm doing psychology things. I'm really tired. And I wish I didn't' have to study so that I could go to sleep. I also wish I could type faster. I'm glad I'm here. Because being almost anywhere is better than being in Baytown. Except for being in Houston. Houston is all concrete and construction. But UT has squirrels. And lots of them. . What am I going to say in the whole 20 mins. I have to say anything I want? . Will people actually read this?. I guess I don't care if they do. Because I'm the type of person that thinks it's pointless to write for my own enjoyment. I get enjoyment out of other people reading what I write and then them enjoying it. . Hmm. I miss my boyfriend. Even tho he made me ANGRY last nite. He's still a nice and good boyfriend. On another totally random note. I've got this pimple on my face. Hahaha. It hurts! And it bothers me too! I want it to disappear! Not that it makes me look bad. I actually think it makes me look somewhat cute! hahah. That's kind of weird. Oh well. I wish I had a memory card for my playstation so I can finish Final Fantasy 8. At this rate. It'll take me YEARS to finish it. But maybe this is for the better. So I can study instead of play, because I would definitely be playing that and Metal Gear Solid. But. Only on weekends. Hahaha. I'm a girl that plays video games. I'm weeeeeiiiiiirrrrd. I wonder if I can get that job at the LanCave. I would be EVER SO HAAAAAPPPYYY. That would be awesome. It doesn't seem hard at all. just like the same stuff I did at eb but instead of renting people games I sold it to them. I don't miss eb at all. I wonder if Julia left yet. That place is the devil. And video games are the spawn of the devil. . I wonder what Marky is doing over at UofH. I hope he's having fun and he's not regretting his decision to go to UofH instead of UT. yah. We used to be big UT heads. Then he changed his mind and I changed my mind. And then I changed my mind again. And the I changed my mind back again to UT and now here I am. Woot woot go me. I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope there's free therapy after this writing exercise. blaaaaaaah. I haven't met very many people that are into stuff that I'm into. Except for Maryam. I can't wait to meet some other dorky kids that are into videogames and Japanese and cute fashion stuff. I want to go to Anime Club on Friday. But I will be going all alone because I""""m sure that Ashley will not come with me. But Maryam might! I totally forgot. I will call and ask her. But that means that I have to give up Wushu practice. Maaan. I have such big dreams. But I have no idea which ones to follow. That gets frustrating. Okay. If I decide to give up Wushu. Then maybe I can get into fencing. or maybe even Kendo. But wushu is so neeeeaaat! but I don't know if I even have the strength to do it. it's crazy. maybe I should not do and just try again next year. No hard feelings, I hope. I don't even know if I'll have money to pay for that. I hope I get ANY job on campus. I'm. just. Bleh. I hope I get to stop being so anti-social. I'm not really anti-social. just a bit shy and cautious about who I talk to. I think that's a good thing. However, it can be very lonely. My wrists hurt. I wonder if my brother is having fun at home. probably not. Lol. He never seems to be having fun when he's alone. Aww. Now I feel bad for leaving him. Maybe he'll be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something. I don't want him to be all lonely like I was as a junior in high school. . I wonder if my older brother has decided to go to graduate school yet. Or if he's really thinking about that invention thing. Heh. At least he's got his major and he's doing it in 4 YEARS. go him. He's my hero. Hahaha. I'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do, because I sure don't. I'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need, and doing something that I looooove to do with all my heart. I've found, thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship, that I can learn to love almost anything. which is a bad thing. I have no idea what I'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out. I already feel like I'm running out of time right now as I sit here typing out a required assignment. It's crazy. And frustrating. And I don't' want to try to do too many things at once, because that is what caused my uber-dramatic downfall my senior year. Okay. Maybe it wasn't a downfall. But it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think I'd know already, having been a human for almost 19 years. Silly me. Oh well. It won't happen again here, because I'm not in Baytown and I'm away from people that drag me down. I can choose who to interact with most times here, so that puts me in a position of power I rarely have. Yaaay for college. very glad I'm here and not in Baytown. ",0
"Here I am sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts. I am thinking that I shouldn't worry about what to think. I am not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary, but then again I am no psychologist. Whoa, change in thought. Now I am thinking of England and of how I wish I could go there to see the sights and see a close friend who lives there. Now I am sad because this reminds me of Princess Diana and of what a wonderful woman she was. I was truly saddened when I heard she died. She was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for  a moment. She was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you. This sadness takes me to other places, I am now simultaneously thinking of a close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of AIDS. I am a Christian and I have strong Christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving a supposed loving God. Sometimes I praise God for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why. I have always been a dreamer, setting my goals high, but sometimes I wonder if what I want to do with my life is right or if God wanted me to go off and become a minister. Life is never simple but I just try to roll with the punches. A minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt. They try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out, but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much. At the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to a lesser degree of love then is possible. I want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly, but in reality I have been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again. Whenever you go on a date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself. I think that is a huge crock of shit. I am a multi faceted person, I don't even know what being myself would be. Is that the self that you express outwardly, where in my case I am jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very, very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring. Sometimes I feel like I have all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give it to. I try not to dwell in these places for any significant amount of time. I think IO like who I am, but its just that I really haven't figured that out completely yet. At first I didn't know what to write, but now I am glad we did this assignment. It is good to get your feelings out from inside when you don't want to tell anyone and you don't have a diary. Bye-bye. ",1
"keep an open mind. """"If you can't change your mind, how do you know you still have one?"""". Anonymous. I read this quote today morning and started thinking about it. Do I really have my own mind or am I controlled by thoughts and opinions that other people have? Maybe everything I do and believe in is based on what somebody else does. Obviously there are a lot of things that I believe in because my family/friends believe in them too. My faith in god may have been initially because of my parents faith in God and because of the stories that they told me about the god and his greatness. Why do I say his greatness. I think about that a lot of times. Why do we always say he?. why do all laws and sayings start with man is, he is. why don't we say. woman is ?I remember once my brother and me had this big fight about this and he being the MCP that he is says that women spend most of their time criticizing men. while on the other hand men do more constructive things. He says that most of the time it's the men who research and find laws and then later women complain about how the theorems or laws are sexually discriminating because they say he and not she, but I know that things are actually a lot different. I come from India and there a lot of women are oppressed. Female infanticide still takes place. I come from a girl's school and a lot of our topics for discussion in school were about these things. whether women should be allowed to join the armed forces. which brings me back to the same thing. why am I a feminist? is it because most people around me were like that or is it because I believe in equality myself. but what do I believe in. hopefully I will be more clear about this after my psychology classes. but will I change my mind about something that I believe in very firmly now, will I change my opinion about something if somebody shows me some evidence that proves my belief wrong. I don't think so, but then that means that I blindly believe in something for no apparent reasons. that's pretty ridiculous. but I know that the mind is very fragile and I think that it's the situations that actually control the mind. like do I make friends because I want to or is it because I have to. sometimes I wonder about the way I choose my friends. is there something common about all of them. maybe there is a certain characteristic that I look for. I also know that I am very judgmental. I will not approach somebody that is dressed in a certain way. so what does that say about me. I look around and see so many people who look so different from me. I feel pretty intimidated by them. since I'm new to this country and this lifestyle. sometimes I feel so stupid and ignorant. But I also think about how every new change that I make in life changes me and makes me somewhat a different person. so maybe I do change some of my opinions over time. I wouldn't know. does anybody know how the mind works I guess nobody does. ",1
I took a class in sewimming last year and it was a lot of fun. my cousin megan asked me to come to her dance recital in october but that is going to kind of difficult since I have three tests on the following week of school when I get back but life is short I may as well seize the day. I didn't call my girlfriend last night so she is probably mad about that but anyway. I like the class schedule that I am taking right now but it is only thirteen hours so I hope I finish my degree plan in four years since I don't want to be in school forever. I have a headache and don't feel like doing anything but relaxing. I wish I was traveling righnt now maybe around the swiss alps and doing some hiking camping and fishing and even some swimming just exploring beautiful places that I have never been to before. I woild love to just have a job where I could explore travel destinations and tell people if it was a good place or not or even just travel the world. I love adventures especially the ones like indiana jones does in his series of movies I think that that is so interesting and fun but I kjnow it is only a dream since all of that is just make believe but hopeuflly on e day I will get married and we can travel the world exploring different copuntries and places and seeing everything this world has to offer. this summer I got to visit seattle and it was very beautiful except that it rained every single day adn that got kind of depressing and made you feel gloomy but it was an experience and a very expensive one at athat. this christmas me and my cousince and bro are goign to go on a road trip kind of like the one on mtv called road rules where we go exploring places and then camping out and living off the land which is really a lot of fun. I hope my mom is having a good day and my dad and sister. my brother is up here in austin with me so we hang out my birthday is tomorrow and I will be the big 21 I can't wait. my firneds are throwing me a party this weekend so it is going to be a lot of fun. I have math homewrok thath I need to do  ,1
"    I am so nervous about what I got on my economics test. I know that I spent a long time studying, but I will be very upset if I don't get at least a B. I can't wait till next weekend when I get to go to Lubbock to visit Ryan. I hope that the Chili Cookoff will be fun. It sounds like it will be entertaining. I am upset that I am not going to get to Sara, though. I wish I could go to Lubbuck this weekend, but I have two tests on Monday. I am so stressed out about those test. I am going to spend a lot of this weekend studying. After I get those test out of the way I need to spend a lot of time on my english paper. I feel like I can never get caught up. I am looking forward to the Phi Psi mixer tongiht. I hope that I can meet some really nice guys. Actually, I don't care if I meet nice guys or not, I am just looking forward towards getting to go out. Lately I feel like all I ever do is study. College is so much more stressful than high school because you don't know what to expect. I am not sure if I am studying enough. At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests. I am so tired. I wish I could take a nap. Hopefully after class I will have time to eat, workout, and take a nap. I am really upset that I haven't had much time to work out lately. When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday. I was always working out. Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes. It makes me feel so out of shape. Britany Spears is the best. I am listening to her CD right now. I had so much fun at her concert. It was weird to actually see her in person. I am so glad that I have been understanding my Calculus lately. At first I was worried that I was going to have to drop the class. I am glad that I decided to stick with it, because now it isn't so bad. The only part that sucks is the homework. It takes forever to do because the questions are so tedious. I am really nervous about completeing the test in 50 minutes. I can barely do one problem in 20. Hopefully they won't be as hard as the homework problems. I am praying that they are a lot more general. I hope that Ryan and I have time to talk tonight. It seems like I am always busy with Zeta new member functions and he is always busy with his rush stuff. It will be  a good thing for me to be able to see him. I need to figure out which airport to fly out of. I hope the planes aren't really full, or else I won't be able to go because I fly stand by. I hate flying stand by. It is such a pain. You have to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your plane even departs. I don't know why I am complaining. It is a lot better to fly than to drive. Once I drove to Lubbock from my hometown, Colleyville. It seemed never ending. Plus the scenery was not very visually pleasing. At least I was riding with Sara, my best friend. We kept each other occupied. That was so funny when we both started singing that one song. We could not stop laughing. Another reason I don't like driving is because it takes up time that I could be doing other things. At least when I fly I can read, do homework or even sleep. When  I am driving I have to concentrate the whole time. I need to go over to the business school today before five. I need to change my passion panel registration times. I am so frustrated with that whole system. I wish I could just get in the ones I wanted. ",1
"Ok well this seems like an informal assignment, so I'm going to treat it that way. And presently I have a bone to pick with women. I'm going to let you know about a little situation I have undergone recently, and see if I can figure out why women are so weird. Ok so first off, I had this girl, we'll call her Jessica, that I have been in love with since 8th grade but never got a chance to pursue. As a background on her, she is a player; meaning that she likes to lead guys on, then break their hearts. But she still had me swooning over her for some reason. She has been my best friend for almost 2 years and so I this summer I decided to give it a shot and ask her out, after all I had nothing to lose. So I asked her out, and she said no because: """"the timing is wrong, college is coming up and I don't want to start anything because I like you so much that I think it would actually be a relationship and not just a game for me"""". So this gets me mad and so I just decided to play along with her and hope she would eventually give in to let me have just 1 date with her. Throughout the summer I continued to pursue her with minimal success. She then left off to school and I never got my chance. Then 2 weeks ago she came and stayed with me and we ended up making out all night long for no apparent reason at all. It was very out of the ordinary, but I wasn't going to complain because I liked her so much. So she started acting really weird after that day, and just ignored me. When I confronted her last night, she told me """" I just don't know what to think, I just thought of you as my best friend, and then that all happened and I don't know why and I enjoyed it but I feel strange now. """" So of course she is just saying this because she wants to maintain control over my feelings and keep me here in case she can't get a date in school up where she goes. I don't like this idea though, so I conjured up a plan that would stop this. She just loves to play mind games so I started playing mind games back, by leading her on and then just not talking and some various other tactics. Eventually I won and she stopped being weird, but last night when I confessed that I was doing the mind game thing to get back at her, she went haywire and got all mad because """"I took control of her feelings with no care whatsoever"""". So my dilemma and all I can think about now is why women are so weird. Not only is she a strange girl, but my ex girlfriend is also adding to my confusion. She is also attending UT and we broke up before we came here, and now she is mad because I am moving on with my life and not just out chasing her around like I used to. This makes her mad so she spends all her time trying to make me mad in various ways that don't work and it is just weird, I do not understand it at all. My friend's dad told me he would write me a check for 1 million dollars if I could figure out women, and with my recent situation, it seems like it is never going to happen. Aside from all this chaos going through my mind while I'm conscious, I have dreams about these two girls in my sleep, and they don't make sense either. So alas I am just sitting here confused pondering why women are so difficult and why they think they have such control over guys' feelings. I don't think I will ever understand but I can't stop thinking about it. And since we were only supposed to type for 20 minutes, and being the slow typist I am finished now, so that's all that is on my mind. I must say though, this assignment could be good because I feel better just venting like this. ",0
"Well, let's see, what am I thinking and feeling?  My thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. I guess what's really on my mind is this day and this week. It's been really, really stressful. The only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. The week did not start off well, as I lost a really cushy job, and it was just because I procrastanated and that made if even worse. Then, I got an interview, off campus 15 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and I had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so I was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where I was supposed to go and was freaking out. I could have cried. Right before I was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance I called back a lady that I had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. It  was my dream job but I was sure it would already be gone. Just my luck though, I impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and I got the job!  It was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. So things got better after that but today things were just shit. One of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. My other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. I cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and I hate drama. I guess I can't complain though, my job is great. I love working with art. The lady I'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. There were just a lot of jobs cut though and I feel really bad for her because I know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. But my other co-worker is really funny and I like her a lot but I'm really sad that she might be going away soon to Washingtone, D. C. Everyone  else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. Let's see what else. Oh yeah, of course boy troubles. Boys suck, that's all there is to it. Sometimes, I wish they would all just die. Or at least those that suck. Not my friend da Byron though. I love him. He e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :)  Also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. Know what I really need?  A break from all people. I just want to be alone. I want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. I want to go to a dig in Greece and get away from everything. I hate feeling I owe something to other's feelings. I guess I'm just tired. The minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. I guess I'm just tired of that. It would just be great to start all over again, but I know that I can't regret the past and that I learn from everything I do. I have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, I mean I have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if I do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. In the end, I guess it's worth it because I know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. It's just what you have to put up with. I only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. Well, I'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but I'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :) ",1
"right now it is 7:30 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over.

I cannot forget to bring my notes from last year from home, they will probably help me a great deal I can understand my notes a lot better My feet are so cold I have to put socks on before I go to bed I wonder how Adrean is doing my roommate took her some pizza that's really nice  I would be mad too, I hope everything works out she's very upset talking to her mom. Nothing is on TV it's hard to believe it's so late already time flies so fast there's not enough time to get everything done shouldn't have stayed so long at the RSC it was nice though and I had a good time glad I went  wonder if Anthony will call back so hard to let go of someone who seems like such a part of you I don't know if it's the right thing but if I wait too long I could miss my opportunity with Eric being friends is too hard because of everything we've been through old feelings are still there and get in the way of being friends I feel bad to do that to him sort of unexpectedly but I can't pretend to be happy with him anymore wonder what will happen we always seem to get back together eventually but this time seems different I can't forget to get my dirty clothes and the clothes I need to wear this weekend at home it is such a pain taking things back and forth  Wonder if Anthony will call Eric is working and won't get off until late have to get up so early and have to have everything together I still have so much to do but I'm too tired maybe I'll do it in the morning but then I can sleep later if I do it now I'll just do it before I go to sleep.

"I am totally hopeful that in the next two hours I will be able to find a date. also I am feeling a little stressed because I don't know what is going to happen to me if I don't do good and transfer into the business school because if I get denied I am probably going to have to transfer back to an easier business school in the Midwest which is the last thing I want to do. I really love it here in Austin, the people are so much nicer than people back in Chicago where I am from. Southern hospitality is really not a myth, the people are truly charming and I love the Southern accent. Back in Chicago the people are not nice and overall the attitude there is obnoxious. That is one of the major reasons that I decided to come here, I knew it would be nicer and it is. But the only thing that I don't like is why I get the vibe from some people that I shouldn't be here, they always ask me """"Why did you come here"""" and they don't ask it nicely. I wonder if it is a possessive feeling that people here in Texas have about their state. It is definitely still going to take a bit of getting used to before I am able to feel like I fit in because right now I feel like a foreigner in a faraway place. I am definitely not used to feel like a minority, it is something I am also going to get a lot of crap for especially with my fraternity, because out of 60 pledges only me and a guy from Minnesota are the only out of states. Pledgeship doesn't worry me but I am anxious to meet people and it isn't happening here I n the Towers where I live because it is so much like an apartment complex and not a dorm that no one goes out of the way to meet people which I truly did not expect. I wish that this stupid girl next to me whose computer I am using who ditched me on the way to your class is are really not nice girl who is way too cool for me , she s got a slight attitude problem and I think that it relates to boyfriend problems. See you later. ",0
"I have heard of assignments like this one before, but never thought that I would sit at my computer for 20 minutes just typing away. but, thats what you want so here I go: hmmmm, I have a lot of work to get done, I need to get my girlfriend's birthday card written and sent out, her bday is on the 14th of this month. we have an interesting relatiosnship. she is going to AM next year so that makes me wonder a little, also, my parents don't know we are together, they would never accept her since she is white. I think thats bull shit personally. I have told my parents they are prejudice, they don't understnad that term I think. yeah, but we broke up before I went to UT this year so that we could just be friends but she doesn't think that fbeing fiends is right. she says either we get back together or don't weven talk anymore, so I got back together. I think it was like an ultimatum, she says that normal human beings would react the way that she did. I question that, heck, you could probably tell me since you're a psychology professor with a ph. d. in something related to psychology I assume. hmmmm, I think we are going to break up, just makes sense, but I don't want to hurt her and who kn ows, she maybe that ONE person and I may be throwing that away, which is a dumb thing to do. yeah, well, I also have lots of reading to do which I better get started on soon. my roommate and suitemate have gone to the library at least every other day and have done all there reading, but I haven't doneany of it. in high school, I never had to bother with any of that. the day before the test, iw oudl read up and be set. I know that won't work here proabbly but yet I still don't take the initiative to read. I think I may just be lazy, or I may tghink too much of myself and find mysefl screwed come sept. 14 since thats my first test, or its spet 16, eithe ron. e   hmmmm, man, dobie food sucks a lot, I ts good I guess but its just that I get so used to it and I hate standing in line. ,. yup yup. theres a lot of dumb bullshit things also, luike I have a friedn tht tells me """"oh, man, be careful when you hang out with them, they blah blah blah and all this. """"  they don't do anythingillegal, they just party or have minor problems if anythuing. let em figure tht out you know, she is quick to give me her opinon and I don't even ask for it. ppl that I respect because the hyave been successful, she says man, he is full of shit. whatevefr, he gets his stuff done and is very scuccessful (I am having a lunch meteting with him to figure out the stuff I should be doing and joining etc. ) and she thinks that he is jsut full of shit. I don't care really to hear it but I can't tell her to shut the *(& up because thats also wrong. sometimes, the situation demands to be mean or atleast abrasive, but thats difficult (not beacuse I don't know how to, I do, I am a former debater) but because its nott eh impression I wantt o give out. well I am getting tired right now, but there is only a few minutes left so I might as well continute. hmmmm, not much else is going on here. yeah there is this big thing about going and partying and drinking and etc,. definitely not my sceneinking, never done it, no inteention to, I just don't want to, but there is definitely pressure created when your firends (Since like age 2) are doing it, and then you wonder why not, might as well. hmmmm, I strill haven't but then again, I have gone home to houston every weekend so far to visit my mom and make sure everything is okay sin e no one else is home (my dad is in india of r business ) and I also went home to see alsion (my girlfriend of 1. 5 years)  that myb the reason she wants to saty together or not even get together, I think she is too attached (she says she loves me more than she has ever loved) she is my first girlfriend ( I love her, I think ) what is love? its a personal point of view that can nver be defined. there are too many differntt types of love, and then even romantic love is interpreted differently. I thinks thats weird. I have siad I love you and so has she but we may mean (although same principle) two completely different things. I think thats interesting. well, thats it my 20 miutes are up, I have been watching MTV and typing at the same time, and man, there a bunch of fine girls at UT, but I don;t think I will get any of them (oh well, I have alison and I don';t want any of thme rright now, buts its nice to know that you could get those irls if youw ant to you know) oh well, thats me thinkin gabout sex again. hehehhe. thats it, enjoy this, I certainly did typing it. see  you (keep this confidential -- I must assume it is) ",0
"     Ok. . i;m sitting in this computer lab of this co-op I'm supposed to like and really bond with. Unfornuately, I don't like the people very much,it smells, and the kitchen always wreeks of too much garlic (like a disgusting amount. )  Oh well. But I really like this keyboard. I think typing on a good keyboard is very important. It can really effect your typing and writing experience. It also has this great squishy thing for my wrists to sit on. All I want to do is pinch it all day. But there are other things I have to do. :)  ok. what next. well some say I'm very neurotic, but my boyfriend was supposed to call around noon and I've called 3 times already and he hasn't picked up the phone. It kind of worries me when he's that late at returning my phone calls. THEN I think about this really great hair iron I just got a week ago and how wonderful it is. It's so wierd that something could make your hair look so healthy when it is actually so damaging for your hair. Get this. it get's so hot, that i've had serious burns on my hands from just barely touching it. They don't like to sell this iron to regular consumers (I guess I know why) but I got a special hook up. Now here's where I get neurotic. I'm really scared that I DIDN'T turn off the iron this morning before I left and I wanted to tell Chad to check when he wakes up. BUT what if he hasn't woken up because the whole upstairs is on fire and he's lying there unconscious or even dead?????  See what I mean?  I'm a huge worrier. Sometimes I feel that I could strech my brain so far that I could litterly make myself crazy with worry. Well, my feeling is. what if it were actually true?  you know, bad things have to happen to sombody. Why does everyone think they won't happen to THEM????  Well, technically, If I were to leave the iron on, it would probably just deconstruct itself and melt the plastic tub underneath it. But it could get hot enough to start a fire, I guess. you never know. Well now I'm getting hungry and I'm trying to decide how to spend my time before going to Psychology at 3:30. I have to put a note on this girl's door so she can help me find a replacement so I can get out of the god-awful place and then I have to check my labor assignments and then I have to check the phone book for the nearest cell phone provider so I can get a phone charger replacement. Whew!!!  quite a day. Oh, and I have to cancel an appointment with my dad because I just want to spend a few hours with my boyfriend. It that so wrong!!!!????  I saw my Dad for 3 hours yesterday and he still wants more time the following day!!!  Sometimes people just drive my crazy. ",1
"     oh boy, the first writing assignment. I hope I am doing this correctly. I can't really think of anything else right now. I sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. I am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can I say. I am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. I don't know what I feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so I guess its a little warm in here. I can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. I guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 20 min of writing sure will suck. well, I still don't know what to think. I'm still bored. I'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company I enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and I occasionally see her on the weekends, although I've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now I'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. I'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but I think I had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when I when I bought it using his credit card account. I guess I thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but I ignored his call because I am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, I like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy I know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although I'm a passivist, I hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. I thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, I think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. I wonder how they're doing. its been a while since I last talked to almost any of them, and I just wonder how they're doing. maybe I should go up there sometime. although I have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another  seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. I'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now I'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. I think his parents weren't too happy about it, because I've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but I ignored his call as well. now I'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy I've know for almost 18 or 19 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. I'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase I know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although I'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, I know he'll be happy, and for that reason, I too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, I hope that this will end soon. and now I see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and I, which I don't thin she should do. I think I'll stop her when I'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till I'm done. yippie. ",0
"I really don't know how to use the Internet and I have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant I am. I really wish that I did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like I will really have to use it in medicine. I wish my dad would subscribe t o the Internet at home. Oh well at least during the Christmas vacation I probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. I wish my dad had not held me to that deal, I mean what if I flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. Forget the car I just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the Christmas holiday just incase I fail. You know I am really scared what if I really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get  into medical school and I happen to fail, what if I became a doctor and all my patients died on me will I be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. I really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so I can see what courses I should be taking and when I can fit them in so I can graduate in four years. You know what this is a stupid assignment because I am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. Mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. You know if I had been a braver soul I would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. What kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to Mrs. whitenight I cant believe I didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, I suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. I mean really since I suffered and improved each and every day in her class I should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what I could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score It sounds really silly, but who cares I don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and You know Mrs. Dubner should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair I mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. This is almost over thank you God I never want to do this again but I have to. Yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad I cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing I have friends like Jean and Rosemary. I still haven�t talked to Dina and I could  not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from Regina the nerve of her trying to steal my major. I mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to Richardson she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than I am. I can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction I am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and I can get me a tutor so I can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. I hope I beat enough so that I graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( I could care less). Rosemary is a cool roommate , I sort of getting a little tired of jean I mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend I hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. Today I am supposed to start jogging I hope I can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself I think. I know I have to call my parents I am especially worried about my mom I mean ever since the death of Princess Diana she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone I hope she gets over it soon. I hope when I am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, I can't believe Jean and Rosemary got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift I have received from anyone since I got my Cowboys' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that  was the last birthday I got present from my parents at all. You know in the two weeks I have been here I have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because I think I was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. Maybe I'll see him during the Christmas holiday maybe I wont maybe I'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way I shouldn't be thinking about that right now I'll think about it later when I am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really read this its not embarrassing I just don't feel like having anyone analyzing my brain waves or my mind thinking pattern, I would rather be analyzing someone else myself. I wonder what the projects are going to like I hope its going to great well I have to go so I can eat lunch which I have never wanted more than right now. ",1
"     I really don't know what to write about. It is funny when you try to think about what you are thinking about and you can't seem to find anything in your head. My friend is talking to his girlfriend. Typing is a lot harder than I remember. September 11th is coming up and I hear patriotic music in the background. My drive back to Austin today was very hard. It rained the whole way down here so instead of the usual three hour drive it turned into nearly four hours. My band practiced very well this weekend. We put in about four hours of practice. Our show this weekend was cancelled so instead we decided to practice. We did a little recording in my guitar player's garage. I stayed up very late yesterday just talking to some friends online. I had a huge burrito from Chipolte. I had never been there before so it was a surprise to see a burrito that big; however, I didn't really enjoy it because they put onions and peppers in it. I suppose it was my fault, because I told them what to put in it. I said I wanted fajita chicken and then started putting peppers and onions in the burrito. I thought the fajita part was the way the cooked the chicken. It turns out it was just the stuff they put in with the chicken. I didn't eat much of it, but I will still give the place a second chance. Now I know not to order that kind of burrito. My parents took my girlfriend and her friend out to dinner on friday night. We went to chili's off of F. M. 3040. After that we went to my girlfriend's house and just played the piano. We played for about two hours. I figured out how to play two new songs. One was a spanish song and the other was carol of the bells. We had no music, we were just going by ear. My girlfriend's friend was getting very annoyed because she did not want to play the piano. Instead she played cards with my girlfriend's family. Studying for college has not been going the way I would like it. I told myself I would stay caught up with all of my classes, but I seem to have fallen behind already with all of them. I just need to concentrate and read like a mad man. Dave Matthews keeps running through my ears and I can't get the lyrics from entering.   How can I turn away. Brother sister go dancing.   I went to two of his concerts this year. They were a blast. There were so many fans yelling and screaming. The atmosphere was so pleasant. He played a few of my favorite songs and I nearly cried. The University of Oklahoma football game was very interesting. They almost lost. I was so excited with two minutes left in the game and Oklahoma trailing Alabama by three points. Unfortunately OU won. They also, unfortunately lost their quarterback with a torn ACL. Texas got off to a bad start although they managed to keep the Eagles from scoring. It looked like the UT offense was about to fall apart in the second half. Next week should be a thriller in North Carolina. ABC will be on nonstop in my dorm room. My mom is calling. She wanted to make sure I got home safely. I am glad to be here with most of friends although I do have friends that are not with me. My girlfriend for one is back in dallas and every chance I get I go back and see her. I wish she was here with me and then it wouldnt be so hard and I wouldn't waste as much gas. Twenty minutes has ended.  ",0
"Right now at this moment, I am thinking about what I am doing here. This whole college thing is still new to me. My roommate is getting drunk right now with some guys, while I am in here writing this. At least she is meeting people. I wish I could go back in time, and be in high school again. I know that probably sounds stupid and immature,but I had a lot more fun in high school. I had friends all around me, I was popular, I was really close to the cutest guys in our school. Now, I do not know anyone. I am used to going out like everyday, so it is really weird to be actually doing my homework. You know what I really miss?  This guy back in Arlington named Luke. He was a complete ***hole, but I was and still am infatuated with him. I guess it is infatuation. I would like to think I love him, but I know that logically it is not possible for me to love him. He was my first you know. I am one of those Catholic girls, and I never thought I would lose it to some stupid high school boy. But, it happened. I wish that it would have happened, and I would not have had any feelings for him, but I do. He has a girlfriend who is younger than we are, and I am insanely jealous. Why could he establish a relationship with her, and not me. And why is it that he cheats on her with me?  These questions boggle my mind and make me upset. I know I deserve better. I am one of those Catholic, upperclass, spoiled girls. I have everything but what I want. Luke goes to Pepperdine University and is far away, but no one here has even caught my eye. I thought once I went to school, my life would just be incredibly better. Well, it really has not. College is not what I thought it would be. I know it is only like the middle of the third week, so I need to give it time. Freedom is great, though. I like not having to check in with the paternals. What is the great thing about that if I never use that priveledge. I am also thinking about how my psychology class is during a bad time. I mean class is at 3:30 and that is about the time I want to go to my dorm and sleep or just relax. I wish I could change my time, but it is too late now. Oh well. Also, I think that Burdine Hall is the hardest building to get to. I missed class today, because I could not find it. I hope we did not do anything important. I hate Chemistry!  Dr. White goes too fast and does not make sense. I don't know if I can survive that class. It is going to be tough. I am used to sleeping in all my classes, never doing homework, and just getting by. That was high school, this is college. How I miss those good old days. I really do not think I am ready for college. Everybody here is just so smart. I really miss having people who are dumber than I am in classes. Now it seems I am the dummy. The next time I do this, hopefully I will be in a better mood. My twenty minutes are almost up, and I have ran out of things to say. I hope this was interesting and different from all the other assignments that you have recieved. Bye for now. ",0
"This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm """"like the nicest person I've ever met!"""". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. Marques hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like William a lot too. He's so strong and """"Mr. Cool"""" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe Marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the Delta party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope William is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while William was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but William plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later. ",0
"Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. Christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 10:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 1: Check, Chapter 2: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 20 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want Matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to Fort Worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 20 minutes- good bye. ",1
"Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called Judith"""" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called """"college life. """"  I feel at home and myself here in Austin. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. ",1
"Many Why's are predominant. Why do I seem to feel unwanted at times?  Why do I seem to feel betrayed at times. Why do I seem to feel like a failure at times? Why do I seem to have lost a yearn for optimism?  Many of these feelings come and go but many do stay implanted in my head. My head is just a constant waterfall. Tons of ideas rushing through mixing at a point which creates pandemonium. My head is a maze which produces many blocks such as this Wall, why when my mother phones me I become bored all of a sudden? I love her dearly and I know that she must be lonely with all her kids off to College. It is because she misses me and because she loves me. Why can't I make that extra effort to make her feel wanted. What can't I give her the same feeling that she makes me feel. Emotions run one-sided in her phone calls. I feel a superfluous feeling of want and she must not feel any. Corrections can be made to this but I just don't try. How can I think that I am determined to do well in college?  How can I feel that I will be persistent and successful in life?  If I can feel determined, persistent, and successful in these things, then why is it that I feel determined, persistent, and successful, right before I speak to my mom in order to make her feel wanted and then I fail. Is this a preview of what is to come in my future, not only with family relations but also with life experiences. Will I continue to think """"I can"""" and will I continue to fail? How can I practice my ways to perfect them. How can I execute my feelings and my hopes. How can I make them come true. How many times do I have to continue to tell myself that this is the way its going to be or that that is the way it is going to be and in the back of my mind I know that it will never be the way that I intend it to be. Does this mean that I am a failure?  What does it mean?  Should it be something to worry about. Will my mother some day get """"fed-up"""" with me. Can this defect ruin my entire life?  Is it a defect?  Why do I think about this stuff? Is it just conscious nature? Why all these Whys I don't know, but what I do know is that there is purpose for everything, and maybe my purpose of life was to wonder why. ",0
"     I went to church tonight. It makes me feel very calm and relaxed. It puts the world into such a different perspective. Everything seems so simple. It makes me want to be a much better person. The television is on. I think it's on MTV. I'm not watching it though. That's annoying song on that commercial. I don't want to go back to school on Tuesday. I have a lot of work to do including reading for this class. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town. I hate commercials. I don't like eating college food. I really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat. My roommate went home for the weekend. It's weird being here alone. I have been going to sleep late this weekend. I turned off the TV. I went to the football game last night. It was fun. There was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol. It makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in. It's very quiet. I want to join clubs here. I really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center. I want to make a difference that way. I'm really hungry so I am eating burnt popcorn. I will prob. make some more after I finish this. I don't know what the point of this is. I think it's a cool assignment, but I wonder what it is going to show about the way I think. I want my boyfriend to call. I miss him a lot. I saw my friends today. I bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them. They are really cute. My boyfriend is from Brasil. It just occurred to me that I'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z. I'm a horrible speller. The tower was so pretty last night. I think it is my favorite part of campus. I look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it. I love it. I like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower. They're just really cool. I think I hear one of my suite mates. She went to visit her boyfriend in San Marcus. I wish my boyfriend was closer. It's hard having him so far away. I know everything will work out though because I love him so very much. Wow. I can't wait till Friday. It was really cool visiting him in Michigan. My dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th. That is also Luis and I's 5 month anniversary. Wow. that's a long time. I want to marry him. That may sound weird. too soon or whatever. But it's true. I never thought I would find someone so amazing. He told me that he wants to marry me someday. I wish that I could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again. I went to this meeting on studying abroad on Friday. It was pretty boring. It was interesting how many countries you can go to. I want to do that one day. That would be fun to experience another culture. I mean I've been to Europe before but only for a couple of weeks. Not long enough to learn about it in-depth. I have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends. It's kind of sad. Especially this weekend. I'm surprised how many people left. I love the picture of my baby next to my printer. He's so adorable. He makes me feel so special. I'm thirsty. Why isn't my boyfriend calling me? I love the sound of his voice. I forgot that I wanted to call my mom today. I wanted to tell her about the game and find out about Bridgette. I hope she is alright. The priest at church prayed for the people in Florida. I'm happy that Carmen goes to church now. My friend once told me that she didn't believe in God. I hope she does now. I almost started crying in church because I was so happy. I like when my boyfriend goes to church with me. He's such a better person now that he's going out with me. It's amazing how much he's changed. He stopped drinking. Not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend. He wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot. I want to talk to my friend ben. He's at LSU. Wow. 20 minutes is a long time. I can't believe I'm still writing. It's getting pretty boring. I don't know what else to think about. I miss my nephews they are so cute. I don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion. That's so incredibly sad. I hope I can help put an end to abortions one day. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I really don't like analynn. Goodness she is very mean and fat. I'm glad that I never have to see her. ",1
"In the summer I had a surgery on my shoulder and currently I am in therapy. The pain I am experiencing right now is pretty bad. I am an athlete and I am used to bear with pain. But all the pain I have had before was relatively voluntary. I am also very anxious to get to my normal daily training. My body is screaming for training. But my body is not a problem, my problem is my soul and mind. I really miss diving and I want to come back and kick everybody's ass. I am also anxious to start studying. I am looking forward into this semester and I like my classes. I feel very excited about school and want to get great grades this year. That's all that I think about at the moment. I am home sick and I want to go home. I can go home for Christmas but I want to go right now. I want to be with my family. I have not seen my family for over a year and I really miss them. I want to be with my friends and see them every day. They are all at home in Russia and I can not wait to see them again. Some of them had babies recently and I want to see them as well. I have known my friends for 10 years and we are very close to each other. I hope I will see them soon.     ",0
Tony just walked into our apartment and Ashley is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed Metallica lyrics. I don't even like Metallica   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 20 minutes. Ashley's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play Broomball later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to Dallas in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy Tony is loud. Ashley's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. Zach is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . I guess I'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. I have no more to write. I'm going now. by3e. ,0
"     Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team. I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow. My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online. I do not knw why I feel so tired. I think its because I am having too much homework. I really do not like the hot weather. I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather. I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework. I really miss all my family. I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters. I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old. I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, """"The king of fighters. """" Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't. I am hungry. I need to go to sleep. I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy. I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week. I'm tired of sittinglike this. I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting. The lyrics from the CD """"Jaguares"""" are so amazing. It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind. If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes. I think I am. ",0
"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, """"How the hell am I going to get home now?"""". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, """"It's lovely weather we are having today"""", kind of person. ",0
"Simply amazed that someone has seen to it that I make it this far without more than what I have experienced that is comparable to adrop in the bucket considering that sometimes I could give a damn about what is best for me for the simple fact that I'm in it for the everything I can get only at times it's entirely too much to compute at once. boy, where has the trrain of thought gone to? Maybe it left to another place out of sight but never to be out of my mind becaause it seems to me that I'm already there. I suspect that everyone else is in their own way. that's why we are told everyone is """"special"""" when we ae too young too know exactly what that means. I'm glad payed attention that day. Uh oh. here it comes again. jealousy rears it's ugly head signaling for the dogs who are  no less guilty of the crime than the one they persecute with their fingers crossed in vain hope wanting our hero to sacrifice his integrity for ideals of what was considered to be right by those who were so afraid of what it was they were dealing with that they confined themselves to an ignorant prejudice. well them fools can stay there and pray they never realize exactly what they're missing until it has already become a haunting unidentifineable thorn in their calloused side. Brains bruised with ignorance rather than blessed with memories of the world they restricted themselves from and feared to the day they wished they had not been such pussies. I cannot pity them, I have no time to devote thought to their rancid exsistence. I have my own to look after. I'm here know and those who would seek my friendship will have it. and those who seek my love will find it. and those who desire my trust and confidence shall not betray it or I shall strike down upon them with the fury of a thousand chained hatred's fire until their very soul.

"well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about. I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down. it probably will. like, I knew this would happen. I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it. my back itches. I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach. I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it. I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying """"no"""", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was. my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class. I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately. I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time. my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me. when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything. now she is always getting mad at me for everything. she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says """"where the fuck are you going"""". I never get mad at her for things she does to me though. I have infinite almost patience with her. she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 2 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says """"fuck Eric, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit"""". I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much. we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to. I have economics to do. ",1
"I guess I'll use this space to rant about this topic. Yes, I used to have a car. She's a silver-blue '86 Camry that my mom bought when I was in first grade. She was the first new car my mom ever bought, and I think she made a good choice. She bought a new Camry in '96, when I turned sixteen, which, by the way, is the nicest car I've ever had the pleasure of riding in. Strap $15,000 to the dashboard, and you have a Lexus. But anyway, I drove the old Camry, Pretty Hate Machine (after Nine Inch Nails' debut album, which is awesome)until I went away to college last year, on my little sister's 16th birthday. So you can probably guess what happened to her (the Camry, not my sister). Yes she got two huge dents in it, running into the same garage behind the restaurant where we work, a garage around which I have managed to maneuver countless times without causing bodily harm to Pretty Hate Machine (which my sister so rudely calls """"The Velvet Rocket!!!""""). OK, I crashed her once and busted her right headlight, but it wasn't my fault, and the other lady's insurance paid for it all, and I felt terrible for putting her (the car) through all that. Gill showed not the slightest sign of regret for her thoughtless actions, having no respect for Pretty Hate Machine.    She's such a great car. First of all, she screams """"MOM,"""" so I never get pulled over in her, not even during the six months she had a busted headlight. She might as well have vanity plates that say """"MOM, RN. """"  Second, she's the most reliable car in the world, which is one of the reasons I felt bad when I crashed her, because she's not used to the shop at all. No, she's never broken down. She's got 150,000 miles on her, yes, she's """"been around the black"""" a few times, rrhaha. She's never broken down. Third, I love her because she's idiot-proof. She doesn't just have that beeping noise when you don't fasten your seatbelt;  she turns the headlights and the dome light off when you leave the car, so you'd have to be worse than an idiot to run out the battery, which my sister did I might add. And you have to lock it from the outside, or else 1 door stays unlocked, so you can't lock your keys in her. She's the perfect car. Oh, and since she's so old and a 4-seater, she's cheap to insure.    Yes, I have a sort of sick emotional attachment to her, but she's just so awesome. She's like an heirloom, having been in the family long enough to serve two generations. I get to drive her whenever I go home, which is nice. It's hard to take her for granted when I don't get to see her that much. Oh, I forgot to add that We took our family Christmas card picture in front of, with me holding the keys out in front of my face. There was this really cute boy in high school named John King who drove the same car, except he had the windows tinted so that he could drive and be sketchy at the same time, I guess. Anyway, I thought he was cute, and the fact that he drove such an awesome yet practical was somehow really sexy to me. And this summer There was this guy named Jon who worked at the same restaurant I did back home who drove the exact same car, except his was more gray than blue. We somehow a big kick out of trying to park our cars next to each other, or opposite each other, or in some geometric configuration. What really kills about her is that every day when I pass by the UTC on the way to class there she is, parked right there, the exact same car, taunting me, torturing me. I miss my Ol' Girl. ",0
"She kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  It kind of put things into perspective for me because I wouldn't know what I would do in her situation. well now that I am back in Austin I try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that I necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people I am with right now are bothered because I am using their computer and I don't want them to see what I am typing, I usually feel this way with anything I do, I don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that I  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . I have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. I am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because I always hold back my thought and when I want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that I work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. I don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and I feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. But they tell me not to worry about so I tell them not to worry about me, I also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that I   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now I'm just tired of being a burden I know what I have to do and  I am going to do it. I have done this type of assignment before, I once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when I said that I was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when I  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes.

"Right now I am really hungry. I would go eat right now but I am going to run with the marathon team tonight. I ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but I did not run during the summer. Lets hope I'm still in shape. Probably not, I'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again. This stream of consciousness in not fun. My thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type. It's like when I'm writing an english paper. I'll get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and I forget it. Good thing you aren't checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that. I hate typing on the computer, well not typing but talking on the computer. The I'M stuff instant messaging. My roommate keeps asking me questions while I'm doing the writing. She talks on I'M all the time. She spends more time in the room on the computer than I do and that's hard to do. She wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to. It's 8 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on. I never liked talking on I'M and I've tried to. I think many of the things I say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone. So I pissed of a few people even though I was being sarcastic. And it could be that I am quiet and don't talk that much unless it's about sports or something. I'm weird, I think I'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports. I have always liked to watch sports. And I pretty much know that I am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 2. I've always liked playing video games. Like right now I have Grand Theft Auto Vice City on my computer. It is a lot of fun. I love playing. I see it as a stress relief for me. When I had a hard day I'll start play the game run from the cops then feel better. I am able to do things in the game that I would never do in real life. I would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that's why I like to do it in the game because I can and will not get punished for it. The people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad. Even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional. All the cops look the same, all the pedestrians look the same. You can tell that this is not real life. If you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you. Now I know that does not happen in real life. There are clear distinctions between the game and real life. I know those distinctions and would not cross them. Some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun. ",0
"ok I begin writing now without thinking about the writing that I'm doing this is so eird why do this why proffessor make us do this will he be reading what we're writing or not and will he be able to see what I'm thinking by just reading. will it offer insight into what my mind works like is it going to help him see what kind of person that I am I miss jun where is she where was she last night I want to have sex with her I want to have a relationship with hertooo this is weird I'm writing dowwn exactly what I'm thinking and it all comes so fast I'm not even thinking like I normally think usually there' ssome kind of method to the way that I do it but now I'm just writing and I'm not even having complete thoughts leading to ideas and resolutions now I want to shift thinking so that I can do some productive thinking or maybe not waste time but I'm stuck on this and I guess I should do what the assignment says jun makes a sound that's so sexy when I lick her earlobe it makes me want to fuck her wow I wonder if anyone will read that and think I'm some kind of pshycho this is so weird I shouldn't care what I write, but my name's on this so I have to worry but I'm sick of worrying about things that's why I drink so that nothing matters that's why I like smoking pot because no worries that's not why I like to have relationships with girls though that's more psychological and I think thati have these relationships because its something to put my energy into to figure out that I'm not into damn I just stopped accidentally owh well now its time for a new stream I need to do this work so that I can get my good grades so that I can get into good school so I can make good money so I can have happy life so I'll be happy but so often to do this I have to do things that make me unhappy I like this classbut not some of my other classes like english where the teacher's a bitch and where I spend the whole time looking at jun because she's a beautiful girl and I want her why do so many of my thoughts concern sex and lust annd anger and fear and worry it would be easier to eliminate the last three this isn't really stream of consciousness writing because I'm actually being much more random in my thoughts than I usually amn so this assignment doesn't make any sense I wonder if thy use this for any psychoanalytical purpose I wonder if other people's writing is similar to minee in any way I guess so since there are fundamental similarities between all human brains and minds that can't be overcome and I'm not that diffeerent from others in that respect I wish I was more like others but not sacrificing the things that are important to me I wish I had a steady girlfriend that always makes me much happier I just met jun and hooked it up with herand now I don't understand the rlationship and don't know if it'll continue and that's frustrating because I want it to and at the same time don't because she's dkind of a slut and might ahve a disease but I lust for her and she's the only girl who's paid me any attention so I really want to have a relationship with her though I'll prbably get hurt and feel like I should never have done it and then I'll be sad again but for now I'm happy when I'm with her and I feeel good when I'm with her and its good I'm still worried that I think about hers o much and that someone will read this that's why these tests are total crap because I have to spend so much time worrying about what the shrink thinks because I ahve this facade to put up for some reason although it won't affect my grade and it won't affect my relationship because I probably won't ever see him agaian and I won't have to face him but STILL I worry why do I do that what am I so afraido of revealing and why ami so afraid of people really knowing what's inside am I that evil and suppressing that much of myself that its making me put up a false front that I think everyone should see why do I opress ok this is really weird I'm starting to get very introspective this is probably not what I was supposed to todo but oh well now I'll be able to keep typing I forgato my ttrain of thought my typing is becomeing more and more flawed because I'm mjust closing my eyes and letting it all flow out on paper fuck jun I'm letting it go I hte something I love something I'm getting in tough cwith emotions I want women I like them they smell good this is funny to whoever reasds this oh well laugh because I guess it really is maybe I'll read it myself afterwords and have a good giggle at myself and maybe that's the point of life to be comfortable withwho you are and what goes on in your head its almost time to stop althought I was just getting very interested int he results and in to what I was writing times up.

"I'm sitting here wondering why he doesn't take a better interest in me. I'm wondering if he has started to see this girl Selena. Am I pitying myself or am I really this strange? Do I actually think that he could love me? Maybe he does, but it's been only a week and he hasn't spoken to me like he used to. I love him so much, God. Why has he changed? Or have I changed? It's been one week though! One week! My heart hurts so much, Lord. Please help me. I feel so helpless, so caught up in something that seems so ridiculous. I love him madly yet he treats me with such irreverence and formality. Then again, maybe it's all in my head, as always. That night in front of his yard. It was wonderful. His eyes. His lips. His smile. The sincerity poured from every valve. I cannot bear to think of him with someone else. I scream with pain at the very thought and I wonder why. Why does this have to happen? Why did I have to fall in love with someone who would fall in love with someone else? I can't stand this. I have to do my schoolwork tomorrow and I don't think I can concentrate. I'm dying. My brain is itching and I'm scraping at the walls to get out of something I am not even in. I hate this city. I hate it here. Why am I even here? I look outside at the night sky and see nothing. I look outside and I can't remember who I used to be. I can't remember what made me happy. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. I look at the street and I can't remember the last time I smiled. It was today, I know. but not the last time I felt it. My heart feels empty. My mind is gone. My eyes are filled with tears and I cannot bear to fathom his leaving me. He is everything. There is no one else. Nor will there ever be. I miss beyond words and I cry almost every night. WHAT HAS HE DONE? WHAT HAS HE DONE? Most likely nothing. Maybe I'm being over dramatic. Maybe I'm not being practical. But it hurts. I saw them, God. I saw them together. He likes her, I can see it. I stood like a fool and watched them. I STOOD LIKE A FOOL. I'm so scared. I'm sitting here in my own selfpity crying my eyes out and wondering why. MY laundry is almost done. It's 11:42. Why, God? Can't I keep him? I miss him. I'm not happy here. I will never be happy again, I fear. Not truly happy. I am not complete without him. I'm crying loudly. I fear the neighboring people will hear. But what does it matter? What could they do? I'm hurt. Embarrassment is nothing. Love is nothing. only once. This must be it. I believe a person only falls once. madly and once. I was so wrong to believe that I was not in love with him. I was so wrong to have said and done all those things. God, help me. I will die like this. God, please help me. It hurts so much. I cannot bear to think that he could love someone else. Not after all that time. Not after everything. Why does he throw it away? Why can't he love me? Simply because I am not there? BULL! That's not true. I still love him. I cry. I miss him. I write tot him. What does he do? He comforts me with lackluster professions of love. Maybe I'm making a mistake again. I used to be so sure of everything. I used to be so sure of what he felt. Now I feel and know nothing. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of writing for this assignment. It's much too private and it's so hard to determine the stream of consciousness. It is filled with idle, petty things. with no purpose. It floats from one island of topic to another without care and without remorse. I hear screams in the other room. I wonder what is happening. Is she excited or raving? I hope she isn't hurting. Because I am and I fear I cannot take it. I won't kill myself. But I do wonder how long I can survive. I've never believed that I could live to see past 30. maybe even 25. I'm so tired. I want to go home. I didn't before but now I do. I wonder if it is because I want to lure him into staying beside me. to keep him near. tightening the leash. God, help me please. Give me some sort of sign. An epiphany. something. It hurts so much to remember. I'd rather not think about it. It's 11:48. He'll be calling in an hour. if he cares. If he wants to tell me that it's over. I'm so hollow. Maybe this is my punishment. Maybe this I what I get for having been so cruel and unloving. Now I love and the tables have turned. the eye has changed visions and my life has become worthless. This is what you get rings through my ears. I'm sick. I only want peace. I want a comforting arm. I want a hug. I want a kiss. I want love. I'm so terrified of losing him by losing myself. I cannot change because then he will not love me. I'm not even sure if I am doing this correctly. I'm doing this in a form of a prayer rather than what I'm thinking directly. Either way, it's something. Oh, Art. Please, say something I need to hear. I myself do not know what it is. but I need you to say it. Maybe I secretly want you to tell me it's over so that I can find another person to fill the void. But whom could possible begin to? No one. You were the one. You are the only. You always will be. Ten years from now when I watch you get married I will still love you as strongly. There is no better person. Your soul is so true and so lovely. so pure and untouched. I was lucky enough to glimpse that. I was lucky enough to love you. Thank you God. Forgive me, please. I should have loved you better. I'm staring at your painting and I can't help but wonder why I screwed it up again. Why am I self destructive. I need you. I need you to hug me. To kiss me. To tell me that you want me. Please. Please please please. I'm so weak. I'm so pointless. This is purposeless. Help me, God. My back aches. My eyes ache. My feet ache. My life is gone. Music could soothe me before. now nothing does. Not friends, not family, not anything. I wish I could figure out who I am. or be told who I am. I cannot figure it out. Please God let him love me. I'm terrified of what I will become without him. Oh God, please hurry. Please send me something. I need a drink. I wish I hadn't done so many things. I wonder who is online. who could make me feel better? John? Does he love me? I don't love him. Although I wish he loved me. Why am I so selfish? Why can't I be good and whole? What did I do that was so wrong? So many things. Please help me. It's 11:55. I'm done. ",0
"Right now I'm listening to Travis. The band not the person. It can be really confusing talking about all the Travises that I know. There's the band, which happens to be from Ireland and is really awesome. Then there is Travis who goes to school here. There is Travis who goes to Trinity and who I dated at the beginning of the summer. I really liked him. It's too bad that didn't work out. Then there is Travis who goes to TCU and who I really like a whole lot. I've liked him for almost two years now. We just really connect and get along. It's crazy when you meet someone you just work with. I have met a few people like that, and I'm not just talking about boys, but all relationships. I always feel lucky when I know someone who is like me, who I can just hang out with and be boring with and just have so much fun. My mom and I are like that too. I miss her so much. She is my best friend. I know some people say that, and it just becomes another petty phrase, but when I say it, I mean it with all of my heart. She is the most awesome person I have ever met. I want to be just like her. That is my goal, my stretch, the place I know I can never reach, but my dream. She is my stars. I would be so happy even to be half as great as she is. She is a teacher, but not only in the sense that she works at a school and teaches her students French. It is one of her innate gifts. She is a teacher and a nurturer. When you let her be those two things, awesome things happen. Now that I let her be those things in my life, we have the most fulfilling relationship one could ever ask for. All I have to do is hear her voice and I am practically in tears. It's crazy how much I miss her. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. I just want to be with her all of the time. It's crazy how this is my mother and I feel so close to her. I'm not supposed to be in that place for at least a few more years. I guess I am just incredibly lucky. My family is the most important thing in my life. I figure it will take time until I get used to being away from them. I don't think anyone would ever peg me as the homesick type. I would have never pegged myself as the homesick type. I had no clue I would take it this hard. That's a surprise. I guess it's such a shock because two years ago first of all I was not so close to them, and I was a major stoic. No feeling. And now I am not afraid to admit that I love my family and miss them. I think that I am going to go home this weekend. I wasn't planning on it, but I don't want to stay away from them that much longer and there's no reason I have to since I do live in San Antonio. It's not like it's a terrible trip. My father makes it every day. I don't know if I'm going to though. I really don't want to ride home between two huge men in my dad's carpool again, and I don't have my car yet so I don't know. I'm still listening to my Travis CD and really enjoying. It's on the last song, which lasts almost 15 minutes and is like 4 songs in one. It is really great. Sometime I have to listen to the words though, because I really have no idea what it is about. Now I'm back to being excited about seeing the band. It's in less than two weeks, and Travis from TCU is coming down to see them with me. That is going to be so awesome. I really want to go home but the whole carpool thing really bugs me. Maybe I should call my dad and tell him that. Just tell him that I don't want to ride home with his carpool because that is a terrible experience. Maybe he would be able to work something out for me. Well, the CD stopped, and twenty minutes has elapsed, so those are my cues to stop writing. I'm going to go make my decision now. ",1
"I thought I was supposed to set a timer. So I set one, and now I don't think I need it. its actually getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to use correct grammar? I'm not using it at all. I'm typing like I do when I talk to my friends online. I like this song on delilah. I love delilah. why don't others? She seems to always make me in a better mood. Or is it because I like depressing music. I love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. Actually, I think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. I think I cry a lot, but I'm not always depressed. I use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. Do I really like him though? Or am I just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner?  He treats me so well. Was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight?  oh well, I'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. But it bothers me when people don't like me. I miss my best friend lauren. That song today really brought back memories. I love college! I'm pretty much caught up on my work and when I finish this, I'll be even closer to being caught up. There is A LOT of reading u have to do in college. Wow. I hope I don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. I'm just so use to typing like this!  that's not good. I don't like this song right now I wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well I have bout 13 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. In fact, I think it's kind of interesting. What time is adam going to call? I wander if he is almost done with all his homework. I love my parents. I'm glad I talked to them tonight. I feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. I love all the people that are here. Many people thought I wouldn't like all the people, but I actually do!  I'm a big people person I guess. I don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in?  I probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. Oh well. At least I read a chapter of psychology today. I have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. I thought he was going to tell us when to read! I found out he didn't, and now I'm trying to catch up. I can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am I going to wear? I have no idea. maybe I can borrow something from sarah. Do I dress up or not really?  I wander if oscar is going to come or if daniel is. How much is it to get in?  Well I have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. I'm so glad I got seventy dollars back today. what am I going to do with it?  I guess save it until I really need it. I think we need a lil more food in our room. I just don't feel like going to the store. Lauren had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us!  Ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. This is awesome! I can type without looking at the keyboard! I've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. I wander how I am going to be creative with my lonestar application. I really really want to make the organization. If I don't I'll be so sad. oh my gosh! I love this song. sure I'll think about you now and then. haha. I was singing. we can do that right? Because I was really singing it in my head. oh man. now I'm starting to feel stupid. Oh well. I wander what other people wrote about. hmm. I wander if I'm doing this right?  ok I'm tired of sitting up straight. I'm so full. I think I need to stop eating so much! But I really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when I say I don't like being so skinny? Skinny people always get teased. I want to weigh at least 115, and since I have come to college I weigh 2 pounds more. 107. ok my time is almost up. YAYYYY now all I have left to do is read and finish my application. Oh man. I have to get my shot tomorrow! ",1
"I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in Austin and I've already been to the Highland mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think Austin has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a Walmart is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to Austin I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at UT. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   ",1
"     Hello looks like a journal entry. Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be. No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all. Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives. Think I will. Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun. What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant. Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons. Inclination says talk about """"me"""". Here's what that is. Or so we'll try. Music, menus, frustration. Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly. Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it. The color of the water is green. Count the levels  of meaning there. Anaphor. Hyperbole. Homonyms. Czech Republic. Czeska Republica. The  United States of my Ass. Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity. The blank might have been filled with """"make love"""" or """"marry"""" or """"help through important  issues"""". Certainly not """"castrate. """"  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing. Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated. I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries. """"  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office. Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation. what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house. Make normal people  sense of the place so that when Mom and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues. Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively. Takeover from an armchair. Natural delicacies. TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God. School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates Ted Bundies. UT is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea. Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success. I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years. Just like that  fucking idiot GW Bush. Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates. It's because I  wanted to call Bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow. Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid. How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me. Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as """"nigger"""" or """"spic"""" or daggerhead, or whatever. This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve. It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it. Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical """"good people"""" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around Earth for some god or cause might hope. That's what makes music --- done. Thanks  for the toilet! ",0
"Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for KVR News and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named Dana. She went to Tulane. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of John. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. John makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the Jester Cafeteria has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. ",0
"Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things. ",0
"alright. what can I talk about. well the only thing I�m really thinking about is richie. I love him so much. ok why can I now see what I�m typing. anyway, I g ",1
"So I'm in the room with 2 guys and another girl and they're having this conversation that's really distracting me. Not to worry, I'll soon be engulfed in my own stream of consciousness and I'm sure this will turn out really funny. Actually, right now I'm laughing because they were making fun of my job. Haha. Alright, back to business. This is one of my favorite things to do. My friend just distracted me by trying to read this. Anyway, work was long and boring today. Lots of restlessnes and paranoia. Haha, the people in the room are being really funny. This guy is telling a really descriptive story (which is how I tell stories) and the other guy is all like,   get to the point!    I'm avoiding trying to read what I just wrote so that I can move on to the next paragraph. Everyone thinks its funny that I'm taking this so seriously. Its really hard to concentrate!!  Lalalala, why do people fall for people who are already in relationships?  And why do I think I actually have a chance?  I think I have a really big chance. But I don't have long term goals. Hmm. I enjoy anticipation and a challenge, and that's what the person I have a crush on is to me. Its really exciting. It got quiet all of a sudden. Funny how that happens. I like it. I like the awkwardness. Uh oh, they're talking about sex now!  Got to love college kids. Ahhh!  So, my throat is dry, I'm about to grab a beer. And I'm one of those who actually like beer for the taste of it. Just call me a beer enthusiast. I'm not even sure if I spelled that correctly. You know, I won the spelling bee in 5th grade. And in 4th grade, I lost because I got the word   condemn   and I spelled it c-o-n-d-o-m. And I didn't understand why the judges were laughing until 2 years later. Anyway, I have 8 and a half minutes left and the person I have a crush on hasn't called yet. She's supposed to come over and play Battleship with me and my friends. I really wish she could break free from her controlling boyfriend. But I'm not one to judge her relationship since I was the controlling figure in my last relationship. ::sigh::  Lets not talk about my last relationship, I'll go to that bad place in my head. No regrets, no regrets. Alright, so I am really tempted to call her now. Umm, how is this computer going to organize my thoughts?  Haha, I work for a computer company. Actually, the biggest computer company in probably the world right now. But that's not really important. Not saying that my thoughts aren't important because I believe everything I say or think has some huge significance. Even if I can't understand them. I don't even know if that made sense. Its hot in here. I hate laptops. Tony just told his roomate to grab me a beer. I should tell them to call Lisa to get her to come over here. Sometimes people need a little push out the door, know what I mean?  I wonder if these pants look too big on me, they're really comfortable. My nostrils are flaring. People think its cute. I am done. Ok, maybe not. I have to keep going for like 3 minutes. My friends are making small talk. Small talk is funny. Ahh yes, a beer. Except I don't like drinking out of cans. Why is that?  I love bottles. And Dos Equis. I take after my father. But then again, I love white zinfandel, which is my mother's favorite wine. Woah, its almost 9:30 and she still hasn't called yet. I'm getting upset. Maybe a little obsessed. I make myself laugh. Now I'm listening to them talk about me. I like the attention. Count down. ",0
"A of the present I guess the most common feelings I have are nervousness, excitement, sad, and happy. I imagine that these emotions are all quite normal, especially for a first year student. I guess the first two I will talk about are the """"better"""" of the bunch: happy and excitement. The main reason I am feel these would have to be that for the first time in my life I have """"true"""" responsibilty, there is not a parent or teacher looking over my shoulder to make sure I finish all my work and get it in on time, it is up to me. Secondly, I am lookinf forward to the learning style of college. No longer will I be bambarded with quesitons asking about pointless dates and useless facts, I will be asked to explain the theories and ideas taught in class. The lack of this is what I disliked about grade-school. I guess, at least in my case, for eahc """"good"""" feeling there is an oppisite, """"not-so-good"""" emotion. Most of the people I have talked to that went off to college were the most nervous about the simple fact of being away from home, """"being on your own. """"  I have friends as close as 20 minutes from home feeling the same thingas those 3000 miles away. But, at least as far as I can tell, I am not that home sick. THe part about being away from home is the fact that most of my friends are going to school at home. Granted I have a few friends going off to colleges that aren't at home or isn't UT, but the most part if my friends are not in San Antonio (home), then they are up here at UT, in fact my roommate has been a friend of mine since 8th grade. Even on top of the """"friends"""" factor, the one that gets me the most is that my girlfriend is still at home. That would have to be the hardest part about coming to UT and the reason for the most nervousness and most about of sadness. Lucky for us though San Antonio is not that far, coparatively speaking, so the amount of time we can spend together is greater than that of my friends who went to other states and have a boyfriend or girlfriend in San Antonio. Although I am in the Longhorn Band, so that, at least for the fall, is eating up most of my time, but the time we do have together we enjoy a great deal, and both of our families support us so that helps considerably. So I guess all-in-all there are a lot of good emotions and feeling in me involving the change to """"college-life"""", but nontheless there are still those """"not-so-good"""" ones residing in me.

"As I sit in this room, in this computer lab, I hear all the different sounds around me. The computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. I also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as I type. I've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. My eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, I would love to take a nap. This day was pretty long. I hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. I'm feeling so tired! I would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. I don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. I know when I go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but I ate way too much today and I am not in the least bit hungry. Not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. I wish I was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. I hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. It would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. Seeing him makes me miss him more but I guess I should enjoy our time together. I wish he went to this school or at least lived in Austin then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. He seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. I don't believe him when he says that. I wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. I am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. I hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? I wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. I think I'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because I'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. I do love him though. It'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. Tonight is Thursday night. This is a good night because I have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. I should have done this assignment earlier but of course I always wait for the last minute. But technically this isn't the last minute because its not Friday yet, and it is early evening. Tonight I want to do nothing but relax! I hope I can get together with my friends since I don't see much of them anymore. I wish I lived at Jester at times like this. I thought it would be cold in the computer lab but today it is actually warm. I have this sweatshirt on but I don't feel like taking it off. How many more minutes until my time is up? I've typed quite a bit of information thus far. Pretty interesting how much stuff runs through my head. I wonder if this is more than most people or maybe its that I type fast and I can type basically every thing that I am thinking. This computer is pretty cool and the icons are cute. I hear music and I'm wondering where it is coming from. I figure since tonight is the Mexican culture night they are playing some kind of ranchero music. They should have a Honduran culture night. Haha. Why is the computer across from me making so much noise? Wow. I sure do ask my self a lot of questions. Well, I think my time is almost up. I guess I have about. its taking me a while to figure this out. I am so terrible at mental math. What happened? I have 5 minutes left I guess. How terrible I am at mental math! I am glad that I don't have to worry about turning in calculus homework tomorrow. My grade for today's homework assignment is going to suck because my teacher does a horrible job of explaining anything and I've been too lazy to go to the office hours. But I did go to the math lab, which was not in service to the calculus students. Why do we have more restricted hours for calculus. I walked all that way to Jester for nothing. I'm sure if I got the proper instruction yesterday afternoon my calculus homework grade would be a lot better than its going to be. Why am I assuming that I will get a bad grade? Maybe I won't. The TA seems pretty easy going and she knows that I am interested in keeping/getting a good grade for that class. I. am glad the movie station is back on. I'd like to be under the covers watching a movie right about now. Sleep. I want to sleep! I wish I wasn't always so tired. Yes! I only have a few more minutes left. I'd say about 2 minutes left. Finally! This is already a one and a half page singlespaced paper in Times new roman font. I didn't know I had that much stuff running through my head. Actually, it doesn't surprise me. I always have too much stuff running through this head of mine and then they all get jumbled up and I can't think straight. I think that's why I interrupt people so much when I'm talking. because I have so much stuff in my mind that if I don't say it I'll forget it. I guess that shouldn't matter since I'll have another 10 million thoughts to compensate for that one loss. But anyways. My time is up. How great! ",1
"The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is an immense feeling of relief. I have just finished the rough draft of my Rhetoric paper. It's due tomorrow and I wasn't sure I could pull it together. It's not up to the standard of writing I like, but that's why it's a rough draft. I find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since I got here. I know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. The first night I was here, I was sitting back listening to my music and reading when I thought about home and everything that had gone on there. I remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. It wasn't homesickness. Something about the song I was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky I am. I've had a great life. My parents were very supportive in whatever I did and still are. My friends were always there for me and I never endured any life tragedies. The truth is that I really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. It just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what I personally considered an ideal life. I really do think I've led an ideal life. Never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. The only thing I consider a life tragedy is the fact that I didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and I fought to hard to get here to not come. I think that I'll love it here. Actually, I already do. Most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. I don't see how. The people around me are great, my classes interest me, and I'm never bored. I don't not miss home, but I'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. As far as I'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. I'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. This weekend I'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which I am finding myself attracted to. The next weekend is another football game. I'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. Marching in front of 80,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. Of course, that's only half the fun. The real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. I'm glancing at my clock and see that I've only got about ten minutes left? How am I going to ramble on for another ten minutes. I write fiction stories for fun, love English, and am a Journalism major. Rambling writing style for me. I wonder why I'm occasionally having trouble continuing. Who knows? Psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. Maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. This is harder than I thought. Maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. When I write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. A plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. Just writing off the top of my head is something new. Well, not new, but usually the ideas I get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and I can plug them into a structure. That's actually how I start a lot of my English papers. Start off the top of my head and find a flow. After that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on. ",1
"Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 8:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 20 minutes. i wonder why 20 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 100 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, jeff's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult.

"     I thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. Actually, I kind of like it. It's kind of like writing a diary or journal. I feel hungry right now and am wondering what I am going to eat for lunch. I am tired of eating the same food at Jester again. The food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. I can't wait until I go home to Dallas this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. I miss my mom's cooking. Just a few more hours and I'll be on my way back to Dallas. I can't wait!  I miss my boyfriend so much. His birthday's coming up and I still need to get him a present. I don't know what to get him. It's hard for me because I don't have a car at UT. I wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. My friend just burned a new DJ cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. I miss my family. Its funny how when I'm at home I wish that I was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when I'm actually away I wish I was home. My roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. He calls her a lot. It's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  He would call me all the time. My friends are studying in my dorm right now. I feel so lazy. I'm behind in a lot of classes and I havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. I need to push myself to study before I screw up my GPA again. Speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and I wish that it would over. I mean I like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. I just hate classes and studying. My friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. Its so funny. By the way the DJ cd that we burned is called DJ Prada G. It's like the DJ is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. Hmmm. Twenty minutes sure is going by slow. I have an ortho appointment this Monday so I'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because I can borrow the notes from my friend. I need to go shopping this weekend; I am so out of clothes to wear. Five more minutes. This assignment isn't too bad. When are we going to eat?  I need to start packing. I am such a procrastinator, I wait till the last minute for everything. I need to stop that. I wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. I have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. We are about to leave for Dallas soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. When are we going to eat?

"     Well, yesterday was a good day, that is until I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. I guess I was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing. I was mad at him and then hung up with him, then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him. It was just one big drama over nothing. I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean. That ofcourse made me sad, because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him. He is attending college at Texas State, the big party school, and I guess I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. He's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up. Although I haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling I've felt in such a long time. It makes me sad because I'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last. I've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more I think about it, the more I worry. Maybe that's why I was being rude to him. My fears just come out in other ways. It's so strange though because I know I can see him pretty much every weekend. I'm just so confused right now. Maybe I'm just stressed. It is my first year of college and I'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors. I just want everything to be okay. I want good grades. I want to have fun. And most of all I want to work things out with my boyfriend. I felt like crying when I got off the phone with him last night, but I held back because I didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong. When I think of my boyfriend I can only think of a future with him. I've known him a lot longer than I've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me. I know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break. I'm only 18. What are the odds of he and I actually getting married, honestly? Then it makes me think why I even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? There really is no point. On the other hand, I need to be with this boy. Life just wouldn't be the same without him. What to do? Maybe I'll just propose to him. haha, yeah right. I just want things to be okay. I just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons I am. Grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense. Anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful. Got some of my feelings out, and I've never said any of this stuff to anyone. It was like a journal. I'm glad I'm taking such a cool class. ",0
"I am sitting at my small desk, looking at my computer I am not sure what I should be writing about, so I just type my shoulders hurt and I am ready to go to bed but I have so much more to do before I leave tomorrow to go home I am excited about seeing rich I wonder what we will do I know I have to work a lot and I w2ill probably be tired when I am done, but I will probably still want to go out because all I do here is work, study, work out, and try to keep my life in order cleaning my root day was a pain in the ass, finding places for everything sucked, and I still am not done. it will feel like a dark cloud over my head until everything is in place, which is likely to never occur. my roommate passed out tonight while studying. she works crazy hard and is so focused. right now she keeps mumbling in her sleep. it is pretty funny. I hope I don't disturb her. I don't know if she would want me to wake her up because she fell asleep in her clothes and stuff on her book. I'll probably just turn the lights off or something like that. I am craving some ice cream right now. I want vanilla frozen yogurt with granola. mmmmm. that will be my reward for getting this done early. I am glad that I finished my astronomy assignment tonight. it was just another thing that was hanging over my head. I have all this damn reading to do. and I can't seem to get past any of it because the second I finish one chapter, there is another chapter due in that book and in my other classes. Plus studying for that menu test. it should be fine though. I always get more stressed than I need to over everything. I like my laptop, but these keys piss me off. I don't understand why certain things happen. the cursor moves and it messes up what I am typing. grrrrr. I also want a diet coke. I am having trouble understanding why people gain 15 lbs when they go to school. I walk my ass off to and from classes. I am so afraid that I am going to gain weight. I didn't have time to make it to the swimming pace today. grrrrr. and I haven't done the firm today either. I really should. I need do. but I woke up too damn late to do it. I hope I get up at a good time tomorrow morning. I wonder when rich is going to call. I think when I finish this I am going to take a shower. that will feel good, and rich will probably call super late, whenever fox's closes. I miss him. I hope he is having fun,  I wish I was 21 already. it is such a pain in the ass. I feel so much older. this juv del class is totally opening up my eyes to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking. and it is making me seriously doubt the stigma of underage drinking. I know they have their reasons, young drinking affecting high school, and drinking and driving accidents and whatnot,  but still. How can I be treated as an adult in the court system, work place, and everything else, but still not be allowed to drink alcohol?  That doesn't make sense at all to me. how can my friends be allowed to fight in war yet not drink beer?  that is silly. and frustrating. and now that I know how the laws came to be how they are, I am even more stupefied by it. I love that class and teacher. he teaches basically directly out of the book, so I just have to skim read it, and that is pretty awesome. and his lecture is interesting, and he makes me laugh. that is so important. a sense of humor is everything. I like my nut teacher too, but learning that stuff makes me fee guilty for eating. if these damn pop-ups don't stop soon, I am going to have a serious problem. I am glad I am leaving again this weekend. even though everyone says leaving is bad, I still have a great time at home. and right now, I don't feel like I am missing out on anything here. I am going to try to balance it well, but I love spending time with rich. I love him, and I think he brings out the best in me. he has such a great sense of humor. and I laugh all the time when I am with him. I laughed so much at dinner tonight with them and bryttne. not at brytt so much, but em and I are so open ",0
"I am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness. I just had dinner. It was very delicious. I ate at the Kinsolving dormitory food center. The library is really quiet and I can hear the tying on the computer. People are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting. I can't wait until this week is over. It will be Labor day weekend. I can't believe a holiday is just around the corner. It seems like just yesterday it was summer and I was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out. Over the Labor day weekend, I would love to go back home to Houston and see my family, but I kind of would prefer to just stay here in Austin. There is so much to do here and there is so much freedom. In a way it can be good but I really need to manage my time wisely. Today's psychology was really interesting. I loved the in class experiment that was done. It was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard. I feel tired right now and I would like to go to sleep, but I know I should get this writing assignment out of the way. I was talking to my brother about computers today. It was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone. My mind went blank for a while and I can't think of anything to write. Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday. I can't believe she will be one year older. She is a senior in high school right now and I bet she is stressing over college applications like I was during senior year. I hope she gets everything done in time. I remember senior year was really interesting. I had to research a lot with colleges and what I wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major. So far, education is what I want to do. I think it will be fun especially if I decide to work with elementary students. I am feeling really sleepy right now and I can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before. I miss my family. Even though I am used to being away for a month. I know I will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months. I hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives. I also miss my friends back home especially my church family. I can't believe I am actually going to say this or actually type it but I also miss my pastor. Especially his sermons. As I am here in Austin, I have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same. I guess I am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us. Especially since I grew up in that church, I really miss all the good memories I have made there. I can't wait until the weather gets colder here in Austin. I heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning. I really would like to see falling snow. I really love the cold weather and I like to play in the snow. Today's weather was nice. I could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face. There was less sun than usual. Maybe it is supposed to rain who knows. But I can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully. I still can't believe that I am a freshman in college. I thought when I arrived here I would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in. So far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time. I try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time I spend in class. I am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university. I just don't know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things. I really hope that I will do well in the first semester of college in fact I hope to do well all the years I am in college. I think I've kind of forgotten how to study. After college applications were done and over with and after I knew where I was going to attend college, I kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes. I still studied but just not as hard and not as much as I should have. I feel like taking a shower and going to bed now. My eyes feel they are slowing shutting but I'm trying to keep awake. There are so many people here at the library. I knew there would be a lot of people but it's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party. I suddenly feel itchy everywhere. I think a bug bit me. It is really annoying and itchy. This has been the most exciting assignment ever. It will be really weird to look back on what I wrote.

"tomorrow we're going to see carrie, i'm really excited, i think but then there's also being anxious about it. i know i should be happy and in many ways i am, it's just weird. because i mean things with lisa have been on the weird side lately adn i don't think it's going to get any easier. maybe it's only this period of transition. i'm glad that lisa's comign out of her shell, i guess i'm still not wanting to. but then thea'ts not really something i like doing. typing on the keyboards makes little to no sense. at least with eva's keyboard, it's letters are separated, i wonder how she writes like that. i hate my dingy old omsputer though its so crappy i wish i could get s\a new one, but theen it'd be bad wasting it on some money. i wonder who that professors in waking life was. matthew said he teaches at UT but i guess it'd be hard to find him. there are al million billion people on campus. which has been weird cause i've been seeing people that i didn't really think i'd see again. i don't quite know what to do about that. i wish that john and i were better friends so we could hang out somewhere away from here and everything in my life wouldn't be so complicated and connected for once. i wonder what he thingsk of me, i hope i'm not imposing too much, i gues its been a while since there has been someone that's really interested me and i wish i could make him be interestedd in me too. i think its that need for love that we all have that makes me get this way. i guess i'd feel much better if i had someone that could hold my hand and listen to everything. i wish on some level i could be taht way with matthew, but when i'm with him, its so much more different. oh god. i'm only been writing for 6 minutes? what am i supposeed to write about. i wonder if this will give me writer  s cramps. that carpal tunnel ? syndrome. i doubt it. but i don't know this is probly the most work i've had to do for a class so far. that and going to cnetral market, which wasn't too bad. i don't see all the glamour of central market yet, but who knows maybe it's there. i'm glad that i know some people in my classes, at least in my art related classes. theatre and psychology are other things. i wnat to be able to go up and talk to someone, but its so freaking intimidating. i think i'll make it a point next time to come early so i can get a good seat. i just wish i wasn't so tired all the time so i could really enjoy those classes. i thought i'd be spending alot more time being intellectually stimulated than i have been since classes startedd. maybe it just takes aw hile. i dunno, i still miss some aspects of high school. god, that sounds lame. and i know it is on most levels, i just miss how easy it was. but maybe not. the latter part of high school was hell. especially senior year. and really before senior year. i can't believe i still think about him sometimes. i must be liek the biggest loser in the world. i wonder if its because of him that i'm still get malfunctioney sometimes. but most days, i know for sure that's not true. maybe i just need someone or something to constantly be thinking about. like i need some drama in my life so i create it for myself by bringing up something that really bothered me even though its way in the past. i can't spend all this time and energy trying to analyze myself. it gets exhausting. i just should forget about it sometimes and just have funn. but then that gets you to be too so-called   shallor  . . that's really lame. i should just not be this way. i don't know. its not like i really think this way all the time. maybe i do but i guess it just seems different when actually writing out ideas as they come. i guess thats what i did with paper journal. thought i've become too lazy to keep up with one. i wonder how anna is doing. i'm glad she keeps in touch with carrie at least. in my aspect i totally understand why she wouldn't make too great of an effort to talk to me. god, i'm such an ass sometimes. hmm. . maybe i should eat ramen. it was so good today. but i dunno, that would mean i got to go work out or something and i know i'll regret it later. i'm tired of worrying about weight but then the flabbiness is not good to look at. i wonder how really obese peopel can live. i mean, not to be rude, but i feel really bad for them. if i were in their position and had trouble with just like moving around and stuff i might just die. aimee is going to sleep and this static crap is annoying the shit oputta me. i guess that's that whole buyy cheap. less quality thing. god but now its' like louder than ever. there headphones off muuuuuch better. my computer is so stupid. makes too much noise. i want to meet john someday. i hope he writes back soon. i guess i was kind of a big jerk for waiting so long to write to hiom. gosh, i hate that. it could have been fixed and we could be writing each other back and forth like we used to. . but noo. . i'm a big freaking idiot. ahh maybe i shouldn't try so hard. he's different than most guuys i know, i think. and i dunno, i really would like to see him one day. at least as friends, even though that might be kind of big and scary. maybe we'll just keep corresponding through email. that would be enough to keep me happy. i think. it's just weird giving so much of yourself so honestly and candidly and without prided or shame to someone you have never seen in real life. though, la ",1
"I just got up about twenty minutes ago and really thought that I should finish this assignment, I felt kind of embarrased the other day when the entire class had done theirs' and I was still sitting around without twenty minutes to spare. I really am kind of overwhelmed by the class and university in general, not that I've told anyone because that's just not how I deal with my problems. I scheduled my classes so that I have these breaks in between that I could presumably use to study, but I instead retire to my dorm room to eat macaroni and watch a movie. I watch too many movies in the first place (I'm a theater major, so it's basically study), but I haven't placed any amount of time into actual studying for classes like biology that I know I have trouble with. Between that and the massive theater program, it's just a bit too much. Here I am, now the tiny fish in the pond when I've spend the last four years on top of the game as far as acting was concerned. It's just a different place, different circumstances, and I just don't know where I fit in yet. I understand that I have to learn the ropes and pay my dues and then eventually I'll be on top (best case scenario anyway). But what will I do if this really isn't the path best meant for me? I really, honestly don't think I'd be able to survive in a desk job for the rest of my working life, and if I don't make it as an actor, chances are, that's exactly what I'll have to do. That prospect terrifies me even more than the class thing, or I guess goes along with it, because to even have a chance at success in the entertainment industry I have to have a broad range of intelligences not only within the field, but general knowhow as well, so I'm back to the first worry. It just seems like it's never good enough, I went to junior high in Colorado where I was the smartest kid in the school, the guy everybody and their dog went to for the answer, I come to Texas and suddenly, I'm not the best anymore. Which was alright with me, it unloaded that pressure, blah, blah, but I lost my initiative to try harder than everybody else to get the grade. Since then, my identity has been kind of in the in-between realm, I have intelligence, I was in the top 10 percent of my class, but most of the actual retained knowledge I have from  high school is pop-culture trivia, but I think I could still hold my own on Jeopardy. That is something that made me feel better about college, about a week before I came here, they were showing the Jeopardy college championships, most participants hailing from the Ivy Leage, or whatever, and I just tore them apart, even in stuff like Chemistry which I had thought was long gone from my memory after sophomore year, who knew? So I guess I feel alright about classes in the end, maybe it's just because I feel so boring just hanging in my room all the time and don't really feel a part of the student body. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later, but like most occurances in the history of man, it's over a girl. Long distance relationships are really hard, and here I am trying to pull one off in freshman year, it's going great so far, and I guess it says something that going out and partying runs a distant second to a five minute phone conversation with her, but it's just not helping me become a Longhorn. I love her to death, I really do, so I just haven't worried about it, I figured that it'd work itself out, and I think it still will. Adjustment is hard, especially such an immense one. Gah, college. I've started to believe that there's a soundtrack to life, I guess we'll probably cover that with the psych TA at some point in time, but seriously. Depending on what's going on in my life, I have certain predelections to what kinds of music, and specific songs I listen to, and I guess it's beyond obvious that it has some psychological base, but it's all the time now. I have Bruce Springsteen's   Secret Garden   running through my head right now, most likely because I just started thinking about my girlfriend a while back, which made me think of the times we've spent together, and for some reason bringing about the two of us sitting and watching Jerry Maguire and remembering Springsteen from the soundtrack and noticing the correlation of the lyrics with my feelings for this girl. It probably wasn't very smart to have done this this morning, I don't feel like my thoughts are in order. It's the morning of September 11th, I just realized. I'm not worried though, I have faith in this country, I have faith in my own ideals of freedom and life and soforth. Bring em on. If they attack again, I really don't think we can stop them, and it'll suck having more American lives lost, but they can't tear down who we are. There's my bit of patriotism, just thought it appropriate given the day, but my twenty minutes are up, so I'm damming the stream. ",1
"I'm just sitting here typing. Mu light is pretty bright. I got it at office max. I got it with my mom the last night she was here in Austin before she went home. We had gone to target earlier that night and I saw one of my friend's car parked outside. It was weird because he is going to Syracuse in New York. My psychology book says Gazzaniga on it and I am assuming that that is one of the writers of the book. There's a picture of my sister and me on my book case. We went to Florida last summer. It was fun. We stayed on a tiny little island with my entire family . There is a little Buddha guy sitting next to the picture looking at me. He is not actually looking at me because he doesn't have eyes, but his carved out eyes are pointed in my direction. My grandparents gave it to me. They are pretty cool. My grandfather was in the navy. I've been to Maine many times and I always go to my mom's uncle's house and play with all my little cousins. Those are some fun times. I'm taking Management Information Systems 310 with Dunn. She seems pretty cool. The book is red and has a little blue box on the side that says Prentice Hall. Come to think of it, I think my econ book is also published by Prentice Hall. I was listening to a song earlier by a band called Outlandish. Good song. There's a sticky note underneath my lamp. My mom gave me this biscotti tub. I don't know why, but she did. I keep mints in it. I have a pack of green gum sitting next to me. It's doblement, the good kind. I'm already tired of writing and I'm only 6 and a half minutes in to this. I still have mono so that could be attributing to my tiredness. I have had it since late February, early March. It's a pain in the butt. I was fine for a while, but right before school started, I could feel it coming back. It's weird how I can feel it coming back. My roommate had to go to some scholarship dinner. I don't know when he will be back, but he is pretty cool. My computer speakers were made by Harmon/kardon. I had never heard of them before. Maybe I had, but they aren't a big named company yet. This could be their way of promoting their product. By striking a deal with HP. My monitor is big. It's a 17 inch Flat Panel. It's nice on my eyes. I used to sometimes wear contacts. I hate those things. They make my eyes all messed up. By the end of the day, my eyes hurt so bad, I can't even stand to keep them open. So I decided to go with glasses. I wear them at night and when I'm in class sometimes. I can see alright without them, but there is some things that I really need them for. My spanish teacher is kind of weird. I wasn't sure what I thought of him at first. But he seems like an alright guy. I saw him at the gym the other day. I need to work out more. But sometimes I'm just too tired or not in the mood or just don't want to go. My ex-girlfriend used to encourage me to go. I actually started going for her. But then gave it up when I got mono. I used to go to the athletic club. I remember walking in from the cold december days after school. It was still cold in january and february. I love the feel after working out. When my whole body feels numb. I don't know what causes it, but it feels good. It's even better when you work out inside and then go outside where it's really cold. I love that feeling too. But yeah, I went running the other day and got that numb feeling when I was done. My dad runs a lot. He is super cool. He went to West Point and all that and still he is a lot of fun. He is serious when serious stuff needs to be done, but all the other times he is cool. My mom does a lot for me too. She helped me move in and whatnot after my dad had to go back. I haven't eaten candy since I have been here. I have decided that candy is one thing that I don't need. I've been trying to eat better and I think I've been doing a good job. I take vitamins every morning and try to eat something too. I have never eaten breakfast and I regret not doing so. I have started trying to eat breakfast but it's just not appealing to me. Oh well. My ceiling has all these little bumps in it. My mom painted my sisters room and used a sponge thing and made the walls kind of bumpy. It is cool. It reminds me of a sky kind of. I went to the football game on Sunday. That was awesome. Quite the blow out. It rained a lot of the game, but it was still fun. It was my first UT football game. My sister goes to TCU and I went to one of her games, but they have no school spirit. Here, everyone gets involved and that's what makes it so much fun. I went down to the box office to get a football ticket for a friend, but they said that I probably wouldn't be able to get one because they were almost all sold out and I would have to wait until Friday to even try. It should be a good game though. We are playing Arkansas at 11 am. Early game compared to last weekends 6pm game. Last game I went in to the wrong gate and had to walk all the way around to find my seat. ",1
"  It has taken me a few minutes to get the hang of things. Meaning, I didn't know the steps in getting set up to use the computer because I really have never had that much experience in using the computer. I went to set my e-mail account  yesterday and also got my IF account number. Let me see what else comes in mind I have no idea but to keep typing. Oh ya here with me is Brandi who is a senior and is helping me get to know my way around campus and also answering any questions I have over school. I am planning to go to the football game this weekend I am still not sure, because my friends don't know if they would rather go to  the football game or go home to Dallas for the weekend. I myself would rather go to the game. I almost forgot that I have to go to my apartment and clean up and then I have to go to the bookstore to return a book that I don't need. Well what else can I write about. . my twenty minutes are almost up but not quite yet. . . I am here staring at other people in the room looking for familiar faces but I don't see one. . . . . Something that just came  to my head was that I really miss my family, especially my mom. My sisters,  and brother mean a lot to me too, oh ya my nephew also is someone I miss a  whole lot. He is the most adorable kid I have ever seen I not saying this  because he is my nephew but because it is true. Time up. ",1
"I was writing a previous paragraph when this computer accident submitted my paper. I was not finished as you probably might have seen. I will continue from here on. As I sit here and try to do this assignment, many things come to my mind. One is all my homework assignments that are due for my other classes. I have spent all day doing chapter readings for other classes and now, though still behind in some classes, feel a little better that I actually made myself read for those classes. At this particular moment I feel very hungry for I have only eaten once today and it was at 2:00pm. It is currently 9:30pm. I do not know how long this paper has to be but when asked to write my thoughts down as soon as they come into my head, my mind goes blank and remains blank for a while. My mind is still held up on the homework assignments that are due for tomorrow. It's been 10 minutes into this assignment so I'm glad I only have to do this for 10 more minutes. Yesterday's lecture just came into mind. I love neurology so I thought it was the best lecture I have heard in a while. There's something about the brain that makes me want to make that field my career. It is a mysterious organ that we are just starting to unravel. I thinks its the challenge that we face in trying to fully understand it that makes me want to become a neurologist. Well surprisingly its been 20 minutes already and I have lots more work to do. ",1
"OK, it's 8:10 and I hope I can get through this assignment without my computer crashing. I hate typing. chris is an asshole; this was a very bad day and I know it's probably bad to always be negative, but I don't fucking care because this is my stream and no one else's and I don't think anyone will read this anyway and if you do, you'll never know who I am because there are ten million people in that fucking class and no one knows who I am. by they way, would it be fucking possible to go to one of those classes and not be surrounded by sorority bitches? I mean, they are so annoying with their chatter about boys and hair and beer and parties, and they talk in class which is really annoying and they make my skin crawl. well I stopped for like 10 seconds, is that OK? are you going to come over here and kill me now? didn't think so. damn, I am displaying some fucked-up-ness am I not? I knew this was going to be a 301 intro class but I forgot that meant freshmen crawling around everywhere. I was never that stupid. I was never that annoying. well fuck, it's only 8:16; but anyway I have a ton of homework to do today and a friend is coming over  for dessert later, so I need to get this done. i will add some happy thoughts just so you don't apply your analytical theories and conclude that I am mad and need to be injected with some medicines to make me happier and more docile. happy. happy. happy. nothing comes to mind. except that donny's trial is finally over and that makes me happy. my brother, donny, was accused be a couple of girls of molestation during a clarinet lesson and that was nine months ago and my family had to pay thousands of dollars to defend the lucky guy and now we have no money, but at least those mini-whores backed down, yeah thanks, after 9 damn months they were like (my hand hurts) nevermind, we don't want to testify (because we're lieing!!!!) how do you spelll lieing? liing, lying yeah lying, sorry that I don't know how to spell but who cares becasue no one is going to read this anyway. I am a very fast typist so I think that my writing will be longer than most chris just walked by sophie the kitty is playing with the lizards and chris is trying to look at the screen but I think he shouldn't his is my fiance and my fhands hurt carpal tunnel carpal tunnel I have a huge secret: I have a giant crush on an old english teacher of mine; she is a woman; and I an engaged to marry a man. hahahahah. that's funny.

"My heart is beating so fast. that's probably not good. I'm actually getting . I just sprayed. nervous about writing this. I keep messing up on the whole typing aspect, so I have to stop and go back to fix things. deep breath. this music is so pretty. I wish I had an amazing voice like Alice Ripley. I totally just got a shiver from the notes they were singing. ohhh, her voice just squeaked, but it add emotion. That's so amazing. I just pooped my back, that feels all strange. geez, my computer just did this whole weird Sticky Keys, what was that? You should have chosen . such an amazing song. That note he sings, it's gorgeous but he says it as EWWWW instead you. that irritates me. I  don't even now the words. If only he really loved it would. wow, that was amazing harmony. I hope that ticket stuff gets there. I want to be this part so bad, why aren't there any theaters auditioning for this musical. My jaw keeps popping. Why am I yawning so much? Nose, itch.

Of course, I'm not the one shedding and leaving hair ever. on the floor, in the shower. it's so gross. He doesn't love you that's why he is hesitating. Ever time I listen to this, I still get emotional. It's so powerful, I don't know I just connect with them.

Ewww, something total floated across the floor. could it be hair. I think so. I know it's definitely not mine. It's so gross. Why did Sarah come in here and ask if I was singing. She acted like I should be ashamed. I can never tell that harmony. I want to learn it so bad. These ant bites are really painful. They're all scabby. is that how you spell that. because I kept itching them. My stomach is all nervous like. it's because I'm all nervous about this assignment. and that stupid accountant jerk.

"Ok, I am starting writing for 20 min. My thought, are what I am writing about. Right now I am still thinking about visiting my friends at Baylor this weekend, not sure If I want to do that. I have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what I have to do. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why I am thinking about visiting Baylor. I have to be back at 5 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also Stephanie wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 3,4 in CS, chapter 2 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to Baylor tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see Blake and Lauren and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with Jacqueline or Susan, most everyone went back to see Dave, I wish I was seeing Dave, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them. Oh well, I can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant GNC on Tuesday, I may go run then work out a while today I want to figure out what I am doing tonight first though. Blake said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. So I am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, I need to work out defiantly this weekend. Hmmm, I wish I could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, Ashley keeps asking me to come visit her, which I should do but I am lazy, hah, I have no time for anything anymore, I squeeze in homework and studying, I need to do something about that, I would like to see Ashley though, I kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than I thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, I guess I have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl I have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, Anne was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, I need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. I guess I will skip workout today and just go up at about 2:30 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore I thought would be. I just have weekend plans on my mind so I can't think of much else. Psy is fun, I need to be a little less tired Monday so I can enjoy it, I will work on that. Over and out. ",0

I can't typew very well so i am using this time to practice on my typing as well as doing my homework. the mouse pad is from centuryinter. net and century telephone. i wonder how many staples can fit in that stapler. my neck is starting to hurt it feels better now since i popped it. i wonder why people like leather so much. my knee is hurting. thereis some sort of law exam book beside me of the desk. i wonder what that wooden block over there is used for it lokks like some sort of picture frame or maby a name plaque. oh i am tired good i only have 3. 5 minutes left to type. i wonder if chris is going to call me and let me know if his business is going yet. I know the laundry bags are ready. i like the logo its a hanger with lines to the right of it like its moving really fast. and says campus exppress laundry service or something like that. i don't know if iu want pizza i have had double daves the last couple of days i don't know what sounds good though ooow i know chick fil a yes thats what i want i feel really hungry now only 10 more seconds 5 4 3 2 1 no i think i'll quit      ,1
"     My mind is blank right now. I'm doing this late so i'm nervous that it won't count for credit. i went swimming today, but i wish i hadn't because then this would be on time. sometimes i get homesick, i called my mom today and she was talking about my cousin's wedding. she was surprised that i was willing to pay for my plane ticket there. i think i would regret it if  i didn't go. i've never been to boston before. i hear that it's very historical. I guess they have good clam chowder there, that's what people say. I like clam chowder, but i've only had the kind that comes in a can, so i guess i haven't had real clam chowder. i like a lot of foods from a can. people laugh at me because i still like spaghetti-o's. oh well. they laugh at a lot of things I eat. I really hope this counts for credit. It's only an hour late. I can't believe I forgot, I'm usually so good with homework. If it doesn't count, at least i can still try to get good grades on everything else and maybe i can still get an A. i have to try really hard, i guess even harder now that i realize i am forgetting things, but i want to go to graduate school to get my Ph. D. in psychology. so hopefully i'll start remembering to do all my homework. i've been pretty good with keeping up with the reading in all my classes, but it's a lot of reading. i knew college would be a lot more work than high school, but i never imagined all the reading. i'm actually enjoying this writing assignment, i haven't written in a journal or anything in a long time. it feels good to get things out. i used to write poetry too. that made me feel a lot better when i was sad. usually it had to do with guys. they always find a way to make me feel bad. it felt good to be able to turn something bad into something good. i should get back into writing poetry, maybe someday it'll actually be good. i only let a couple people read it and they said they were good, but you never know if they're just saying that or not. i like a couple of them but i usually eventually decide that they're not very good after a while. my two favorite ones are lost somewhere. that really upsets me. i wrote them on a plane. i know i didn't lose them on the plane but when i packed to move here, i still couldn't find them. i wrote them in a spiral but i have a lot of half used spirals. i hope nobody took it. i don't like it when people read my poems. only if i show them and even then it's hard. i don't know why, i  guess it's because they're so personal, it's like i'm completely open and vulnerable when people read my poems. they read my most personal thoughts when they read them. except for a few, some thoughts i just don't put on paper. some things that i'm really not proud of would really not be best on paper because then i'd have to look at them again, or someone else could read it. my parents go through my sister's stuff sometimes, so i assume that they go through mine too. i hope the don't find the pictures from the party at my house. i forgot to bring those and they would probably cut me off if they knew i had a party there. it was fun though. that was the best party. everyone said so, so i know it wasn't just me who had fun. people were dancing and everything and everyone was getting along, usually somebody gets in a fight at parties. boys are so stupid. wouldn't that be a funny last sentence? that seems to be a pretty good conclusion though. it always seems to come around to that.

"RIght now I'm thinking about not that much. I'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. I'm thinking about how I miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. It's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. He's just sitting there playing a video game and I'm really excited, but yet I still miss him and think about him. It's a rather cool feeling. I'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. I've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd I still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. I'm thinking also that I want to listen to music. Music relaxes me a lot, and I really enjoy listening to it will I'm doing mindless things. I enjoy it at other times too. I'm also craving sweets a lot. I'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. I'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in Houston. Prior to this I read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 30th weding anneversary, but I couoldn't really htink of where it is. I'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. Earlier in teh day I watched hte first half of hte TExns game, so I'm also wondering if they won or not. My sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and I'm wondering if any day things willl get better. It's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so I'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what I can do to make it better for her. Randomly I also think about my parents. I just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. Normally I wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before I moved up here, so I think about him a lot more htat I probably would. My email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. I'm also thinking about my math class. I have homework to do in tehre later tonight. I really don't like the calss. It's riddle math, so I spend my time wondering about how I'm going to get thropugh there. Currently I  m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. THer are no equations, so it drives me crazy. I really don't want to even look at my homework. It's about the only homework I've procratinated on since I  ve been here. I'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. I have dizzyness problems, and I'm trying ot think of a time when I can see a doctor. My sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. Now I'm starting to feel stressed. Usually I don't feel stressed, but then again I usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. I'm wondering if I can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. It's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. I'm also trying to figure out when I'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. I've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. But now   m going to go to  a store tommorrow to finally get something. But I'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that I can get. I've never been to this store, but at 5 tommorrow I will find out about the stuff int ehre. According to my firned she says that I'll be able to find stuff there. Hopefully I will, otehrewise I'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd I'm constantly worrying about money. I am botehrd especially when I have to pay for unneccessary things. Which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. I'm also thinking about what position I would like to run for. Earlier today I went to an RHA meeting. Unfortuantly I missed the first half, so I didn't get all the information. I'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if I want to be an RA next year. THe other positions seem like high positions where I would have to campaign a lot, and I  m not that type of person. I'm still worrying somewhat about if I would have to campaign for my wing thing. I really would preffer to do that, I just hope I don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. Kind of like the girls who I think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. THose eveil people. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. Everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. Rather unfair. But I really get annoyed even when I see them. I've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. I  m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. I needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. THe noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. I'm not much into video games, unless I get to shoot something, but I still wonder what's going on over there. Or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. The same screen, all day long. I've wondered if it actually   fries   people's brains when they play. Or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. The noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. I'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. Supposedly it's only one hour, but I wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. I'm not sure how to tell my best friend if I dont' want to play. I do want to play, I just don't know if I'll have the time. But I also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. So that is a rather hard argument. Why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. I want to just expand time, and do everythign I want, and stop rushing through it and      ",1
"well I think this is a fun experiment. lets see, what am I feeling? I'm sick. and I can't stop sneezing and coughing. which is distracting as I try to write this. I'm not sure but as I'm writing this I go back and correct my spelling mistakes. I love rings I need to get some more. I only have one on my middle finger and its really pretty. man I can't believe I didn't say hi to brian this morning when I saw him. its so pointless to act like I didn't see him when I looked right his way this morning. god I hope doesn't think I'm some kind of moody bitch. I feel incompetent. I have no specialty. last night I tried writing 2 songs but it doesn't help that I don't know anything about songwriting or reading music or coming up with a beat. although I must say I have things to say. so at least that is good. I'm annoyed with myself for getting hung up on things that already happened. wait am I doing this wrong. this feels  more like a journal entry than just what am thinking in the moment. ok I need to stop reading what I just wrote. this room is dark I should open the blinds and jeez if my nose could just stop running. man I'm tired of typing already and its only been about 9 minutes. I need to call maz and ask what is up with our friend who I emailed 2 days ago and has not responded yet. I wonder if he is still in egypt and maybe doesn't have access to a computer. I want to paint my bedroom a light green or yellow color. does that say anything about me. god I feel nauseous. I don't even know how to spell that word. I have to stop eating weird combinations of food. I just had peach yogurt, garlic and parmesan cheese its and graham crackers with milk. I don't even have room for lunch. I must work out. god beyonce has a nice stomach in that baby boy"""" music video. if I could lose another 23 pounds that would be awesome. I just need to work out. I need determination. that is such a powerful emotion. I need to buy more shoes and clean up this mess in my room. but it seems I clean it every other day. ok now I'm freaking out. I have 3 tests this week and I feel a little lost is most of them. boy I need some will power to . man I can't get over this nasty feeling of what I just ate. I feel so lost. what do I do. maybe a nice shower might help. oh only 30 seconds left. this went by faster than I thought it would go. and times up . I'm done! ",1
"At my high school I graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy """"college life"""". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to Taco Bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. ",1
"I'm really hungry. I'll have to go shopping after this. I don't know what to write. I really need to catch up on my reading today. I don't know why I always leave things to the last minute. I was going to try to keep up with things this year but I'm not doing a real goodd job. I have to do computer science tommorrow. that will be easy. I should have called darcie and megan this weekend and hung out with them. kyle should have come up too. I'm surprised I got mike to come hang out last night since he almost never leaves his apartment. I really want to go smoke but I probably shouldn't. I need to cut down. I wish I could think of a place to put these stickers. I had to kill a spider but I missed him. what weas up with all those spider questions in the pretesting. pretesting took a long time. and it seemed like a lot of pointless questions. I need to go sign up for experiments. there sure are a lot of beer cans lying around. I need to get everything cleaned up in here. I haven't finished unpacking yet. I have to go look for a job tommorrow. I wish I didn't have to work, but it will be good for me. I won't waste so much time hopefully. damn, I haven't been writing very long. I hate doing these things cause if I'm thinking about writing everything I think, then I don't think normally. I wrote think too much. there's so much shit I have to do. and I don't want to do it. I'll probably end up not doing any homework again today just cause I don't have to have it done yet. I can't wait to get out of school. I wonder if anyone will actually read this. if so, what's up. I'm getting tired of writing. I'm so hungry. I should start clipping coupons to take with me. I guess it'll make a big difference and I don't have a lot of money. I wonder what my sister's doing.  I should start taking some more pictures. I haven't really done any of that for a while. I wonder what's on that roll of film in my camera. it's been in there so long I don't know what I took pictures of. okay about five more minutes. shit. I wonder where I should try to get a job. hopefully something fun but I don't know what. I feel like I should have more written down for twenty minutes. oh well at least I did something. I don't want to write anymore. ",1
"the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       ",1
"I swear that office space is the funniest movie I have ever seen. """"Yeah, hi!"""". """"It's Bill Lumb. """". I can't stop laughing. Albert is on the bed hugging a leopard pillow. Jo just emailed me from St. Louis and I don't know if she's okay. I haven't talked to her since I left for school. She is okay to take care of herself I guess. I can't believe that Pami, Liz and Katy left for Dave without me. They suck, oh well. I'm doing fine myself so I guess it doesn't really matter, shit, I've got the place to myself. College life is pretty bad ass. No one really cares what I do, well I guess my parents care. Oh well, I guess I'm in another state and it really doesn't matter. Liz is so retarded that she bought a poster about the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's. She picked that out of all the Bob Marley and Pink Floyd posters there. I guess that is just her style. """"I'm going to have to ask you to move again to another office"""" """"That would be great"""" But I set the building on fire. It is so funny I can't even stop laughing. I wonder if Kenny is going to call tonight. I really do wonder how much longer I will really be with him. I love him to death but I'm to young to have a serious boyfriend. Al is so funny. He looks like he would be all buff and mean but he is really complete goof. He tries to get all big so he can impress the """"ho's"""" but he doesn't understand that he can't do that. He's to goofy. Just kidding. He kicks ass though so I guess its all good. I can't believe my dad made me add another class. Schools already been going for about two weeks and Ill have to make up the work. Plus all the other stuff I have to do. I want to be able to go out more, and have fun. That's what college is for. I'm still going to study a hell of a lot but also party too. I don't want to miss out on anything and then have to feel regret for not doing all that I'm allowed to do now that I'm in college. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out. I guess their just freshman, well so am I but oh well, and they will get in the hang of it soon enough. Peace out PSYCHOLOGY its been twenty minutes. ",1
"I just got back to my dorm from my friend's dorm. I'm so tired. My eyes feel blurry cause I need to take out my contacts and my head hurts. Oh man my head really hurts. At Johnny's dorm, he tried to tickle me by grabbing my neck which is where I'm most ticklish. Everyone knows that and yet he still grabbed my neck. SO I leaned back away from him in order to escape and I hit my head on the shelf thing by the bed. What a loud noise there was. It hurts so much. Anyways, I can hear the fridge making sounds right now and it smells like Korean food in my dorm. My roommate just had Korean food. I'm not really used to the smell and it kinda bothers me but there is nothing I can do about it. Speaking of which, that is why I'm never in my dorm and I'm always at my other friends' dorm. It's because of the Korean food smell. Plus, we don't have a tv in our room and it makes it kinda boring. I can now hear clicking noises from the mouse that my roommate is using and the typing on the keyboard. I like the clicking sounds. I don't know why but for some reason I think of horses walking everytime I hear the keyboard. I've always liked the sound. Man this room smells like Korean food and I don't like my jeans because they feel too short on me. I think they shrunk because yesterday I was an idiot and I washed them in HOT water. I don't know what I was thinking. I meant to put warm water but I accidentally pushed hot. I told my friend Danny about it and he was so nice. He came over to try to help me cancel the wash but he was not able to. My pants feel short now and they are exposing my ankles and I'm wearing low ankle socks and its annoying because my ankles feel cold. My hair is also in my face and the A/C is making it move in my face and its really annoying because its blowing in my face. My roommate just went to the restroom. I hate the sound of the door opening. The door makes this stupid and annoying creaking sound. I don't know of any door that does that. WHy does she have to slam the door? Why can't she close it quietly? How come when I leave I am nice enough to close the door. AHHH! the phone is ringing. Its a scary sound cause its so loud. But yea anyways, why can't she close the door quietly? Well, I don't like my laptop. I hate typing on this thing. I spent so much on it and I don't know but the keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. Everytime I type something it jumps back a few spaces and then I have to erase and retype. So I put in a new cordless keyboard and its much better. I really ought to get my laptop checked out. I mean I spent so much on it. It has to work! I need Danny to come and look at it for me. He is like the computer genius. Speaking of which, I forgot to ask him today what a database is. Today in MIS, I had a guest speaker and she kept using the word database and I didn't know what it meant. I hate computers. I really do. I don't know anything about them and it makes me feel dumb. My neck itches now and so does my head and my hair doesn't look so nice today. I would have had time to straighten it except that my friend Phan wanted to go eat breakfast and so I had to rush. I hear noises in the ceiling. Its probably from the people living above me. At first when I heard noises, I thought they sounded like rats scurrying in the roof but then I realized it can't be the roof because I don't live on the top floor of the dorm. Man I'm glad I don't live in Jester East cause it smells over there. In JEster West it is so much nicer. Gosh, I'm itching all over! I need to shower tonight. My back also hurts. Its been hurting for a while now. I keep asking my friends to give me a massage. I think I have back problems. I hope they aren't severe. I can hear the bathroom door closing even though the bathroom is across the hall. That's the thing I don't like about living in a dorm. You can hear everything all around you. I think my roommate may be coming back cause the door closed and I hear footsteps. The water is dripping in the sink. I can't make it stop. I just realized it right now and its really bothering me. Drip, drop, drip, drop. Its really bothering me now. I just thought of something. I wonder if I'm suppose to be putting indentions and starting new paragraphs for this writing assignment. Oops. I should have thought of it sooner because now its just one really long paper. I hope I don't get points taken off. I hear my cell phone ringing but I'm not going to pick it up. I'll call the person back later I guess. Oh yeah, my cell phone. Its really weird. I set a certain ringer and it does not ring with the ring tone that I picked out. It rings with a totally different one. I don't get it. My roommate just got back and my friend Lena is also hear. I see that she has Starbucks. I love starbucks. I want coffee now. Ooo, coffee. I have this coffee chocolate candy bar. NO one likes it. I don't know why. It tastes so good. People just don't know anything about chocolate. Why did my roommate and Lena leave again? Its quite again and I can hear the water dripping. Man, my arm keeps itching and I have to keep scratching it. They've reentered and now they have just left. I wonder what Jennie and Lena are up to. And she slammed the door again. Geez! Anyway, I just remembered that I'm suppose to call my mom. She told me to call her every night and I've forgotten to call her. So now I've got to call her. ",1
"This computer lab, Jester East, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. ",0
"And so know I begin my first assignment in psychology. I don't know exactly how to begin this but I'm giving it my best shot. Typing isn't my forte so this is going pretty slowly. My roommate just walked in and then right out as soon as I told him what I was doing. Wow, there's something on the screen besides solitaire! He must be thinking. I hope my computer gets fixed soon. It'll be so much easier being able to send this through the internet from my dorm rather than going to the SMF lab and waiting for an open computer. They should have come to fix it by now. I guess they have a lot of people to help considering that I've called them two or three times already. And when the Ethernet starts working that will be awesome. Lightning fast access; no more waiting and waiting and waiting. . At least the phone lines are up and running ( in my room anyway). And not only that I got two free phone cards on the street today. I love it when they just hand out free stuff!  Uh oh, I just heard some cars screeching outside but I can't see anything from my window. I hope they're o. k. I can't leave this keyboard! Hmmmmm, I just got writer's block and I'm writing through my stream of consciousness. I wonder if that's bad. I just got a song in my head but it's not like I can write down the notes ( it's instrumental ). My gum is losing its taste, I think that I might need a new piece soon. It's Winterfresh gum. It's my favorite. I don't exactly know why it's my favorite gum, but maybe I'll find out in this psychology class. Psychology is a kind of hard word to type and it takes a little longer that some of the other words. My roommate just turned on some music. Its called Prodigy, the group that is, and they play electronic music. It sounds pretty cool, I think I'll go listen to it. ",1
"So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. Victor is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like Austin and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that Brandon got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of Dallas for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word Dallas programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to Berkeley next year. Not Berkley California, Berkeley Boston. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the Northeast people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end ",0
"I am really really really hot. I don't know what to say. My girlfriend just called she's going to New York. I have some pretty messed up feelings about that. To a certain extent I feel kinda abandoned going here to UT. All of my friends are going to that amazing just right school for them. Me. I took the easy cheap way out. I knew that I could get in here, so I only applied here. Thats not to say that I don't like it here, I really do. I think that it will be interesting. I am really hungry. My roomate isn't here, he's working. I get to go to the dining hall all by myself, and I get to sit down, all by myself, and I get to proceed to eat. all by myself. I really like my room. I don't know why, but for some reason It has just taken over and become home. I'm not sure what to think about this expirement. I know that I've done stream of concious writing before because I took some creative writing classes, but now I'm afraid that this is going to be used to analyze my brain and you're going to use it to steal my credit card number, and forge all sorts of stuff. Speaking of credit cards, I got my first today, and had to send it home with parents because you can only activate the cards from your home phone, what kind of messed up shit is that?  I'm sorry, I really should stop swearing. For some reason my mouth has to the potty since I started. I  d o n ' t  k n o w  w h a t  to  say. I'm sort of bored right now. And I'm sort of in a strange dillema. This is going to sound sort of like Jerry Springer. I don't know if I love my girlfriend. I mean, I do, that's not the issue. It's that she's going to New York, and I'm here. And I don't know what to do about that. I'm going out to see her at thanksgiving. I really miss what she brought to my life. It was that feeling of completeness. I know that this is bad, but I'm already starting to look around for something to replace that feeling that is gone. I think that long distance relationships suck. You know that I can type really really fast. Sometimes I think that I can type faster than I can think. Or maybe thats the other way around. Maybe that's the reason this is turning into somany things that I don't know were floating around inside my head. It is right now five fifty. I have ten minutes to go. I can't believe that you're going to actually read this. That is really impressive. I can't imagine reading six hundred different stream of concience writings. I think that either your going to grade them pass fail, or you're an insomniac with nothing better to do with your time. I really wish that I could have a totally silent computer. You know, that's not random, It has to the fact that right now it is humming. I would put in some music, but that would mean taking my hands from off of the keyboard, which is illegal. So instead I'll play the game by the rules, and sing along to something in my head. Jen, Jen, Jeeeee----eeen Jen, Jen. She doesn't fucking care are are. Whether I like her or not. Okay that didn't really work out. I hate how you can only remember the lyrics to one part of a song. You end up singing like this. Word Word Word, dum dum dee dum. This shit would be really funny if I could instead speak it to you. I gaurantee that I'm the guy who will never shut up. Although lately I feel that maybe I've been too quiet. I think it may be time to sing something in the dining hall, maybe that will make people want to sit with me. Only five minutes left. That means I can eat by my badass lonely self. It should be fun. Maybe I'll call this girl I know. The problem with that is that I don't know where or friendship begins and ends. I don't know if she even considers me a friend. Its a total fucking mystery to me. I want to sit her down and tell her look. I think that I like you. The problem is that I'm afraid of rejection and failure and all of that bad stuff. You see I think that maybe I would make a good psychiatrist, because I've been through some weird shit, and that would help me to understand what was going on in other people's minds. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just totally fucking alone in the world. It's a frightening thought. And there I go with the swearing thing again. I would go back and edit it for langauge and content, but I figure that you probably won't be reading this thing anyways, so what does it matter. I like the fact that you seem to know how to handle a big class. Sorry, I don't even know why I seem to be writing this to you. I really should be writing this to myself. And if I was writing this to myself, I think that maybe I would rather just mull over it in my own head, as opposed to online, on paper, on something. So that's what I'm going to do. Good bye Gotham City ",1

"The on e thing in my mind right now is obviously college. I didn't really have to study to get past high school, but I foresee a lot of changes in my schedule, just 20 min ago I did ALL my math homework for the first time in maybe a year. If studying was my chief concern than I would be perfectly satisfied. Unfortunately that is not my only concern. I am originally from Houston, so as much as I hate to admit it I miss my home, and even my parents. there are so many things about home that I miss, thing that I nerve thought would matter, things like going to the bathroom. Well I miss the past, and I am worried sick about the future. How will I do in my first test?  How will I register for spring classes?  Will I have enough hours to graduate with a BS degree in biology?  Will I get into Medical school? If I don't get into Medical school, then what will I do?    Obviously time is the only thing that will answer these questions. but you can not help but worry about them. Ever since I was little I wanted to be a doctor. Well not from the beginning, I have wanted to be a doctor ever since I was 11. That is when I had a brain surgery. After that I wanted to use the life that was saved by another as a tool to save other people. There have been a lot of changes that have occurred in me but one thing that has stayed consistent within me is my passion to help others. The one thing that made me feel occurred when I was 5. My grandfather and I were walking down a street when we ran into a beggar. my grandfather had just bought me my favorite kind of ice cream. When my grandfather took the ice cream from me and gave it to the beggar. at that time I hated I'm for it. . but when I went to sleep that night all I could see was the gleam in the eyes of that beggar. it was at that time that tears starting coming out of my eyes. I felt proud that I had participated in something so beautiful. Being a doctor to me is the best to repay god, and my family, and those doctors that saved my life.  The one thing that I am afraid of is the one thing most people are afraid of. failure. Fear of failure has always driven me forward, it is my opinion that fear of failure is the one thing that keeps this world going. everybody has a goal in their life and the fear of failure makes them work as hard as possible. hopefully one day I will walk out of a doctor as a doctor, who just helped saved someone life. . that would be a dream come true.

"I feel really crappy, today, I didn't get enough sleep last night. I think part of it is the Texas loss on Saturday, especially the way they loss. Least the Cowboys won last night. So far I haven't been very home sick. It might be because my roommate went to the same high school as I did. I have also been able to talk to my parents a lot because of instant chat. My mom wnts to get a web cam so she can actually see me. I think she has a hard time with me leaving, I'm the first child to leave home. The network here at UT is really cool. The connect rates are really fast. I had a crummy 28. 8 modem at home. My dad was going to get DSL, but we lived to far from the central office, that sucks. I'm really hungry now. I'm not hungry in the morning, but halfway through class, my stomach starts to hurt. It's probably because I'm used to sleeping late and not eating breakfast at all. 10 min to go. I'm not taking an English this year. That's good. I don't like to write papers very much. You might write a paper you feel is perfectly valid, but turns out to be wrong. Yet you put so much work into it. 6 min. Milk tastes pretty good. I'm used to 2% at home, but here, my roomate and I just buy the full vitamin D milk, yum. I hope there isn't a writing length, I'm having sensation block. 3 min. Time is almost up. Might take a nap, my next class isn't for another 5 hours. I don't have classes on Fridays which is so cool. 1 min. My alarm is about to go off. Set it for 20 min, so I wouldn't write too much. Time's up.    ",1
"I'm thinking I don't know what I'm thinking. its like my mind is still working although I don't know what to write. I wonder how the keyboard  came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are. my history class will be more difficult than I anticipated, my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about. I wonder if he's married, I think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife. I knew a guy at my high school like that, he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him, I never understood it. he was friends with the craziest people. terrill had a death wish. he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge. I wonder why the timer isn't working. I thought a timer was counting down when Pennebaker did this site as an example in class. I'll just stop the timer when 20 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working. I hate computers. I hate computing. computing is going to be a bad class that I am not looking forward too. UT is a beautiful campus. I like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking. I want to get a bike so I can ride to psychology quickly on Mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after. I'm worried about kaitlin. I think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but I think war might change her in some way. she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers. I hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going. Iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. if a sandspider attacked me I would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life. rishi is making a weird ass noise. like breathing when you are lifting weights or something. brian is my best friend and he almost died. it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die. I am 18 and invincible or so I thought. this must change the entire way he views life. don't treat it as something to take for granted. it is definitely a gift and some people just don't understand that. they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse. I need to get a rug our room is dirty. I'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long. I like the way the window faces north. I can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning. I want to buy a hang glider really really bad. what is my fascination with flight, it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot I don't know. I hope I didn't choose the wrong career path with the one I have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless I become moderately rich. I hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel, even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever. I wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport. that might be a fun job. maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. Austin is a cool city. I think if my job permits me, I would like to stay here for a good portion of my life. I also want to live outside the US for a while. in a country that has ancient cultural significance. maybe Greece or France or Italy. that would be the shit. I feel like stretching. my back always needs to be stretched after I wake up. I wonder why that is. ok so the timer should have reached 20 minutes by now so I will hit submit. ",0
"This the third time that I am typing this thing. I am so frustrated. Every time I get close to the 20 minutes I get cut off. There is a party I want to go to now I am here stuck here spending an hour doing this thing. I don't know what to type because I am tired of staring at this screen. It seems as if in the past two weeks  I have had no time to myself. Between pledgship, school, and studying, I have no time. The only time I spend in my room, is done sleeping. I am just going to describe what is going on in sportscenter because I haven't watched it in about a week. Chris Berman is talking about the upcoming pro football games this weekend. I used to idolize berman. I also liked dick vitale. I was so obsessed that I wrote him a letter. a few weeks later I got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside. I am halfway done!   I am starting to calm down. I have never been to hot-headed. I try to keep a level head all the time. The only time I really cut loose is when I am in a competition that I feel I can win. this may not be very often but when it does happen I thrive on the situation. Only eight minutes left. I really respect Pudge Rodriguez. he is the catcher for the rangers, my hometown team. I also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. mo vaughn is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. I like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. I hope to get good grades. I wish this assignment was over. I love college football. I loved to play football but I never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level I wanted to . I hate danny  schayes. his dad was a great basketball player. One minute left!!  my favorite team is the cowboys. I love going to the games and cheering them on to victory. I think my time is up so I will write later!  the simpsons is the best show on tv by the way. and caddyshack is the bast movie ever! ",0
"Ever since I came to the University of Texas I have been thinking about playing soccer. I turned down a few soccer scholarships to come here. I wanted to come here because I know the business school is one of the greatest in the nation. After going to the football game I could picture myself playing soccer in front of all 80,000 people. I can picture myself right now dribbling 5 players and scoring a magnificent goal. Every one around me would be cheering like crazy and I would be the big man on campus. Right now, I am wondering if I have made the right decision whether or not I should have come here. Not only did I do very well in soccer, but I also got very good grades in high school. So, I made the decision to go with my mental power instead of playing soccer. As of now I am glad with the decision I have made. I am having a blast over here. Especially your class. It is the best. My class consists of about 540 people. That is a huge number. That was the size of my high school class in Jersey Village. In my Psychology class right now I have been sitting next to this very pretty girl whom I like. I am thinking about her right now and how it would feel if I kissed her. I am also thinking about my mom and dad at home. I know they must be very lonely. I just hope that their health remains in very good condition. I already told them that they have to live to be at least 80 years old. In high school towards the end I started to slack off. I told my parents that I would get very good grades so I have to study a lot this year. I am hoping that your tests will not be very hard. My sister is going to Texas A&M and is majoring in psychology. If I ever need help or anything I can always call her. She is a junior right now. Ever since I got here, I have been missing my cat very much. I have a picture of him next to my bed so I can see him every now and then. I can't wait to go home for the weekend. THANKS! ",1
"I can't believe that I waited until the very last minute to do this. I've never beem so crazy stressed out of my mind ever in my life. I just couldn't find 20 minutes in the last seven days where I could just sit down when I wasn't totally fried. I hope that this dose not bode poorly for this semester. I think I can oull it out. This Festival I can't believe that Cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . Having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . I think I'm holding up but I feel that I coming apart now. I think that's what I scared about. This year I've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what I can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph I've learned so much. Mostly about what kind of person that I am. What am I capable of. Which is some great stuff. But I'm not there yet I 'm almost there though. It's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that I'm a T. A. or look to me for help. It's strange I guess people see good things in me. I like that annd I do the same thing. . I gues I'm just used to people being more aloof I hope that I'm not that way. some of the people that I have met at this festival have given me that instant companionship. That instant love and that's so great. . I guess when people are looking to me for answers  wheither it's about their cameras of their relationships I guess that means I'm becoming the type of person that I want to be. . That's a great reward in itself. I smoked again two nights ago. I have to stop after quitting for two years I can't fall of the wagon and go back to that. . It was only a few cigs (one fantastic Nat Sherman MCD the very best) I can't let this girl. well she's not doing it really. I can't let the tantrum I'm throwing:) over this girl mess up what took a long time ito acheive I feel like a hypocrite when I smoke now. I don't know I just get lonely filled with self pity overwhelemed and I just want a catharsis. . smoking is sort of one. . I don't know I need ito stop again I don't think I 'll go back to the way it was but it's still scarey. I really think thigs are'nt as bad when I have a second to actually relax and evalute things I feel very good. . like the night before class tabling at the show I realized how many people I have met in the last year how many close friends that I'm making and have made and how important that I've become in certain peoples life and how much I'm going to be doing in the near future. It's all going to be worthwile I think I just feel impaitent it just seems like I've been waiting for ten years to get the chance to do what I want to do. what's going to be the best for me. and every BS class I have to take or everytime some jerk in Communications office is rude to me and everytime I'm treated crappy at work it's just one Bergman-esque humiliation after another. sometimes I hope that my   artistic spirit   doesn't die the death of a million pinpricks. . I really like this kind of writing it's been pretty theraputic, but I have to go    ",1
"Today has been an interesting day. I woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt I was in a bad mood. Then I went into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and I thought I would read the morning paper the Austin American Statesman to keep up the what is going on in the death of Diana, Princess of Whales. Since I am starting out in my major right now, which is Journalism, I find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the forefront of all media coverage in every medium. It seems strange that I am 29 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. It is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. I am actually studying Public Relations, but I have to study Journalism as the foundation for my study. I guess I chose PR because my dad is the Public Information Officer for the Portland Fire Bureau. He has worked there for over 25 years and I used to accompany him to work on some occasions when I was a kid. I think I liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. Also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. I liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. Also, I loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer.  Oops!!  I just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. It was my husband's Professor that is the chair on his dissertation. Her name is Nina and I always joke with Thomas that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. I don't really believe it, but I like to tease him. I know Thomas will be very faithful to me. That is one of the things I love most about him. Anyway. Getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that I read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of Diana, Princess of Whales. I think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that I didn't even know about before. I don't worship Princess Di, but I feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. The articles revealed how much she is the People's Princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. I think to myself, wow!  What kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. She did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and AIDS victims. She was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. In some ways, I see her doing a Christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. I believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and/or fame which demands mass attention and respect. I love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. I am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. I am feeling very sad once again. Why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. I wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. Why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. I believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. I am thankful for people such as Princess Diana and for the example she has been to so many. That brings me to another reoccurring thought. Is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. I believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. God wants us to recognize that He is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to Him for guidance and help in this life. So getting back to my earlier point, taking Princess Diana as an example. Some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of Princess Diana this whole week in the media. Well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. Isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. Yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't DO anything like make new laws or something important like that. My goodness!!!  That just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. That is unfair. I think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. Every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. Why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. I know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. Why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so ME-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. Why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. Haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. My wish is that people will carry on Princess Di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. We could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another.  Well, this has definitely succeeded the 20 minute allotment. I thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. It has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. We need more heroes like Diana. She is an example to us all. It is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. I pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death. ",1
"As I sit here and drink this very nasty coffee. (coffee maker is on the fritz) I look back and recollect on this past weekend. In fact this has been my only thought since Monday morning. So I can give you can better understand what I am talking about, I will give you  a background premise to what occurred. I was sitting on the computer, as always, talking to my boyfriend in Houston on a chat group. He and I are still in that """"newlywed"""" phase of a relationship, so we are constantly wanting to be around the other. My having to be a couple hundred miles away in school is causing major distance pains. Any way, I was trying to encourage him to come visit me for the weekend. He was regretfully working on both Saturday, and Sunday lunches ( he is a waiter, where we met this past summer) . He replied to my requests with a request for me to go down there. I thought about it for a brief moment, decided that I had no major plans for the weekend, and immediately called Greyhound. I was on the next bus home, in one hour. He was so completely surprised. As he put it, it was one of the largest signs of love that he had ever been shown, for someone to just up and leave on the spur of a moment, spend over $50 that he knew I didn't have to spend, sacrifice a weekend of my time, just to see him. He was on cloud nine, and as soon as I saw him, so was I. Well the weekend progressed, and I had a wonderful time. I also had a chance to meet up with my friends still in Houston, without having to report in to my mother. thankfully I neglected to tell her that I was in town. Well, on my last day there, before my ride to the bus station, he and I had a heartfelt conversation. He basically proclaimed his undying love for me, and told me exactly how special I was in his life. He also went over all the things that I did to let him know how much he knew that I love him. He remembered all the little things that I have done since day one. which really meant something to me cause I know that my actions are received with such appreciation. He felt that this last one, my coming to see him on the spur of a moment, was the ultimate. He then proceeded to tell me of a mental list that he had of who he envisioned his wife would be, what kind of person she would be, and what her traits would be. He told me that I fit every one, and he said that I was his perfect companion. Both of us have seen a lot, and have dated almost every type of person out there. I know that he is the one for me, I have known it for a while. I have been told that when you meet that certain someone, you will know it is them, and you will know that they are the right one for you. Well. my mind, heart and soul are screaming at me that Terrence is him. Well, I stated a few things to him that I had been thinking about, and at one point,  I started to cry, out of sheer joy at what he was saying to me, I have never had any one person ever express their feelings to me, and I don't think I have ever experienced love at this level. I was so happy that the tears just came. Oh. to explain the next thing, I want you to know that we have talked, hypothetically about marriage several times in the past. but it was usually never in a fully serious tone, only half serious. but each of us was contemplating it. When he saw me crying, he embraced me so tightly, and with such warmth I felt at totally peace, at that moment, he whispered (and I still don't know if I was meant to hear t or not) that he had """"finally found his wife"""". he pulled back from the embrace, looked so deep into my eyes that it felt as if he touched my soul, and right then and there, asked me to be his wife. I was soo taken aback that I couldn�t speak. I have never been proposed to, and wasn't sure how to respond. All I could do was smile one of the biggest smiles I have ever made, and I replied yes. He said that he was completely serious. no hypothetical at all. he also said that he would ask me again, but this time, would present me with a ring. I know that it could be a while before he can get up the money for that. but I am willing to wait for a man like that. I have never meat anyone quite like him. I have only been in love 2 times before. one lasted for 3 years. but it ended as an abusive relationship. the second was only a one sided love. He was leaving for the Marines, and didn't want to return the love because he knew that he would come out a different person. But both times cannot even compare to my feelings for Terrence. Now I come to my contemplations. I had plenty of time to think about my life and where it was going on the bus ride home. I know that I want to spend my life with Terrence, he and I share the same values, we are both religious people in our own ways. we may not go to church regularly, but we are both at peace with God and what He asks of us. I have never met anyone that was religious and not afraid to admit it, but he isn't overly religious to the point that I am disgusted. :O)  We both have the same values regarding marriage. in effect, neither of us believes in divorce. Marriage is for all time, and if you marry a person then it is forever. """"'til death do you part""""  I know that this could work. The biggest obstacle that I can see is the age gap. he is 28, I am 18. It hasn't posed a problem for us before, my mother likes him, and sees that he shows acceptable behavior, and treats me with the utmost respect. He never belittles me, or disregards what I say because I am young. In fact he looks up to me because I have set such high goals for myself, and will stop at nothing to achieve them. He also knows that I want to wait until graduation, or at least close to it, before I get married. And he knows how important Med-school is to me. He also says that he will not marry me until he knows for sure that he can support me. he is one of those chivalrous guys, that believes that a man should be able to support a family on his salary alone. but if his wife wants to work, or even makes more money than him, then he is all for it. he just wants to be able to know that I don't have to work. At the same time, he is giving me more support about being a doctor than any other person. including my family.  One thing that bothers me is that he is 28 and still a waiter. I know that it is only temporary, he is working for a career in music, either with a band, as a musical engineer/producer, or as a teacher (he is one of the best drummers I have heard. and writes INCREDIBLE music. everything from piano pieces, to synthesized complete modern music. he can do it all!!!!  I know that with my income alone, we can make it. even starting out, being a doctor will be able to support us. The problem could arise in the fact that we will be in debt for a while, paying off med-school, and it would be a shaky start. But of course all marriages start out financially shaky. I am also concerned that because he is so much older, and more ready to settle down, that he will encourage me to marry before I graduate. that would just be another added expense. By the time I graduate, he will be 31. I just hope that he can wait that long. he says that he can, and that he will, I believe him, but he may grow antsy as the years go on.  Bottom line is that I love him, and will do anything in the world for him, but of course within reason. I also know that he would do the same for me, without even needing me to ask. I have never felt this way about any other human being. and I don't think that another love like this is possible. besides I don't want any one else but him. soo. Yes, I will marry him. and we will have beautiful children. We know that once this """"honeymoon"""" feelings wear off. our love for each other will change. but as I know my love, I will still be there. by his side. I have never met anyone that completes me, and who I am, so perfectly as he does. not even my best friend. Terrence and I connect we realized this when we first met, and had our first deep discussion. In fact we connected to each other so well. that it scared both of us. and with reason. when you meet someone and the next week you can complete each other sentences. and already know what the other is thinking without them having to say a word, it can be a bit scary. But as we grew, we grew more comfortable with the idea. and now he is ready to marry me. my life couldn�t be more perfect, and I couldn't be any more happier. I am in love. and now, I am engaged!!

"    Stream of Consciousness:  That time counter is very annoying, the videos that switched. a really good song just came on, I think it is by Mark Anthony. This office smells kind of funny sometimes. I met this Girl named Maria today and she is a runner for UT. I hope Parking and Transportstion appeals my ticket. I have some really random thoughts.  I want the best things out of life. But I fear that I want too much!  What if I fall flat on my face and don't amount to anything. But I feel like I was born to do BIG things on this earth. But who knows.  There is this Persian party today. My neck hurts. But I am excited about attending this party. The girl I like will be there. She is my ex. Btu it's all good. I hope she still has feeling for me. I woke up this morning with a terrible head ache.  I am wondering if I should invite my brother and hos friends to that party. I really wasn't invited myself, but I know Marjon will be there. I have some messages on my phone. How do you track feelings?  That must be hard to do. I feel good!  Healthy, kind of tired - but its morning time. I should call Janaina. I miss her. She is very cool. I hope no one actually wastes their time reading this. Because this stream of consciouness in BS. But it's ok. I guess I will learn something new from this class. I made a taks sheet for today. But I dought (is that how you spell that word?) I will finish everything on there. But I might. Life is much simpler when you have direction.  I need to get stated on my well logging  homework. I bet you guys don't even read this paper. I would be interested in seeing how people stucture this writing assignment. I mean, the way people form their paragraphs and stuff. As you can see I like writing paragraphs 3-4 sentences at a  time. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, time is almost up. I am very glda to be done with is assignment. Thanks    ",1
"As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 7 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in Atlanta Georgia and they are mostly going to UGA but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend Pamela the most and my best friend Michael the 2nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really I�m not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 13 years old and he is in 8th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 97 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope I�m not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 4 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. ",1
"of course I relize that things could be much worse. I mean this could be a real writing assingment, which would totally suck. I'm thinking about if I want to ask this guy to come to a show with me and my friend and her boy toy, but I don't knoe whether or not I will probably not. I just e-mailed my mom - I had never used e-mail before and it was quite an experience of course now I'm wondering how in the hell I'm supposed to get this little disk thingy out of the stupid computer I'm the most computer illiterate person that I know. college kind of sucks man it's not like on t. v. - it's much hotter. I freeze in my stupid room and roast outside no wonder everybody gets sick here. so anyway blah blah I have some dumb-ass roommate meeting to go to even though I just love my roommate to death and she of course reciprocates the feeling so we have no problems we're just one big happy family speaking of I miss my twin brother a lot he's in chicago at the art instite of chicago I just LOVE to tell people that because I am damn proud of him god typing sucks I've probably been going for abtou 20 minutesff saoe already opps little mistake there but its all good right>? I'm such a slow typer jesus christ this sux man I wonder what the next assignment is have a nice day man peace and love all around ",0
"I am so tired right now that I don't want t go to class right now but instead just go to sleep in my nice and cozy bed. I wonder if this one girl likes me and it is driving me crazy because it is affecting my thoughts. I wish it would get cooler here; It is so hot and dry outside. I wonder if I have any other homework to do tonight because I want to just relax and play some basketball. My friend has just gotten on I'M and I want to talk to her but I hafta do this assignment instead. I just thought of something funny that happened in psychology class. I think I could have broken that lie detector test easy and in the mean time made people laugh too. Hmmm. I am getting hungry right now and now my roomate has just came in and keeps asking me what I am doing and now I can't concentrate anymore. I really enjoy watching Michael Jordan play basketball and I want to get that video that is out on his greatest moments. Dang, my room is messsy I really need to clean it up, oh well. I wonder if the MTV music awards are going to be any good tonight. sounds like it would be interesting for a big get together with friends and stuff. I just got out of my english class and that was so freaking boring and not worth my time. Well, I am running out of stuff taht I am thinking of. now I am hungry again. I am so hungry but the thought of eating jester food makes me think of really disgusting thoughts and many trips to the bathroom. That is why the bathrooms never smell good because the entire floor is doing the big number 2 all day long. Ok, now our hall is noisy becuase the cleaning lady is vacuuming and is getting really annoying. Well my 20 minutes are up and I am going to take a nap now.  ",1

"How strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. The only sounds I hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. I hope I am not making too much noise. I don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. I can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. I wonder if my friend has arrived at Dobie and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. HOw much time has passed. Oh I still have four more minutes. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? I think he is working. Should I go out with my friends tonight? No I'm going to stay home and read tonight. I miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. I wonder if my friends miss me as much as I miss them? Life in Austin is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. I think I'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that I have been accustomed to all my years living in Houston. I had a routine in Houston, which can not exist here. ",1

"I've never sat here like this before and jotted down my thoughts. Despite them being my thoughts, I don't think much about them. Every time I hear my roommate, Charles, play the saxophone, I think of my brother Marlon back at home. (I thought of this because he is practicing on it now. )  School. This year I'm trying to make straight A's because I crashed and burned my 1st two semesters. Some say it wasn't really a crash and burn. I received a 2. 4 G. P. A. It's definitely not what I was aiming at. I don't know what's wrong though. I set aside a lot of time to study, but I could just never pull through on tests. Some people suggested I have ADD. I always think about whether or not I have ADD. I've usually dismiss the possibility that I do, because that might be just the easy"""" way out. What if it's not ADD?  Just me having bad study habits. I don't know. I always worry about school. 'm going to see a counselor about it. Crew. I can't wait 'till tomorrow morning. We have another practice with Texas Rowing Crew bright and early in the morning. 5:30 practice that is. I found seven people that are trying out for crew too that are living in my apartment complex. In one building over no less. Heather just left. I just got back from dropping her off. Heather's my girlfriend of 2 yrs going on 3. She plays goaltender on the St. Edwards girls soccer team and is having a tournament in Oklahoma for the weekend, getting back late Sunday night. Charles stopped, and is now watching television in the living room. I think that is one reason I can hardly get any studying done in this apartment. There are too many distractions. Plus my bed is so comfortable. Having to wake up so early sort of makes me tired. I learned today that people with a regular sleep cycle tend to have better concentrations than do people with a sporadic sleep cycle. That's what I have. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I wake up at 4:30 and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, I wake up at 7:30. I never gave much attention to my sleeping habits, but now I'm taking a study strategies course that is hopefully going to help me make better grades. I want to make straight A's this semester because in doing so, it will raise my G. P. A. to a 2. 7. Still no where near where I want to be, but its a start in the right direction. 10 more minutes. Speaking of sleepiness, I am feeling very, very sleepy right now. My eyes are getting heavy and my head is tilting. But I'm fighting it because I am in the middle of an assignment. I just looked at Professor Pennebaker's old tests and I do not remember going over some of those things in the book or in lecture. I hope that there was a different curriculum last year. Psychology is the only class I'm all too worried about. I feel like I have no control in this class. I feel like this class overburdens me. I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 4 classes. I'm a 12 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes. I'm getting even more and more tired than ever. I will definitely nap after this writing assignment. My glasses are bothering me and my throat is so dry. My brain is going on hold for a second as I take a swig of water. Ok. I bought one of those Nalgene water bottles. What's the deal with those anyway?  They make them so expensive, and I see everybody has one. So, naturally, I had to get one for myself. Two more minutes. I am counting down this assignment to be over because I'm just that tired. I am assuming their will be some sort of punishment to press the finish button early, so I stop myself from doing that. Wow, 50 seconds. I am very ready to take a nap. 30 seconds. Almost there. Man, I'm going to have to get Charles to shut that TV up when I  ",1
"My name is Laura Van Hoesen and I am thrilled!!! to be here at UT. I've always loved Austin ever since I visited here when I was younger speaking of which I have been feeling like I was a little kid lately because I am in a new place with new people everything is new. Sometimes new is fun like in relationships. new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another. Like my roommate and I are VERY  tired of each other right now. Every little thing she does annoys me and I am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits. I have several annoying ones. My boyfriend says he has not found any, but that leads back to the whole newness thing. He doesn't quite know me. and I'm not quite sure I want him to . I want some McDonald's right now because I am starving I haven't eaten since this morning because I have been running all over campus getting things done. I went to a meeting for the Pom squad tryouts and I had a memory rush from high school The chick who is the director is one of my old drill team director's friends and lets just say I don't like to think of drill team much. Although it seems to be on my mind alot lately because I have been questioning weather or not I should be in Kilgore or not. I am really truly happy for Tracy and brooke and Regina, but I can't help but be envious. I know Regina is loving shoving this in my face but I wish she wouldn't Why can't we just be friends again like we were last year all of this other crap had to start and now its finished kind of. I guess not totally finished because I am still stringing Earl along. I don�t  mean to be so selfish but I like having someone there for security. I have always been given security from my parents and I am used to that feeling I miss my parents they do so much for me like my mom getting this new job one that I don't even know if she likes just to make more money so I can go to UT. My sister loves to spend my parents money and I am finding out how easy it is when you're far from home and you don't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us. I can not even fathom what having a child must be like sometimes I want to have children and get married and settle down and other times I don't want any of that mushy stuff. That is kind of what Earl is there for. Incase I decide to pursue the romantic side in me which I seriously doubt so I should just let him go and I am really bad at typing I used to be better but I guess I am a little out of practice I tool 2 typing classes in high school which I had a nice time in we have such an awesome senior class. I was so proud but now everybody is gone off to do their own thing I can't spell either I have always had that problem ever since I was little my whole family makes fun of me for it especially my sister. I wonder how long I have been typing I haven't typed like this since staying up all night writing and typing my senior research paper on Shakespeare. I love Ms. Holloway she was a great teacher I wonder how heather is doing in Atlanta I should call her tonight and see if she likes her class. It would be awesome to live in Georgia the Indigo girls are from Athens Georgia and I have always wanted to go there and see their home town I think where people are from say alot about them. like my cousin is from Angleton and she a real heavy accent her whole family does I hope she is ok. She went a little crazy after her father died, but who wouldn't my mother is crazy. poor woman is going through so much right now and Suzanne has to be feeling the same way with both of her daughters moving out at the same time.

"I really have no idea what to write about. I am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. It feels like I have just been on vacation and am home now. Some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but I took some allergy medicine and I have no desire to dance. The medicine makes me so tired. My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. She only does that when she is upset about something. I guess she misses me. We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. She was a wonderful dog. I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to Austin tomorrow. That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. I had to sell my horse before I left for college. I had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. I still haven't sold all of my equipment. I can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. Princess Diana died in a car accident this morning. I really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but I guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. Anyway, I think it is really really sad. I especially feel so bad for her children. I was watching 60 Minutes on TV a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. My brothers and I used to fish a lot with the family too. It is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. One of them is 22 and the other one is almost 26. That is hard to believe. I just turned 18 on Friday. It was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. I am also glad I came home because that way, I can be sure that I keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. I want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. I am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. I think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. I went to Camp Texas at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where I used to live in Houston. She told me that a girl I used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. It was so shocking and really sad. I mean, I didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since I had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. My roommate at Towers is really cool. I am glad we get along. I was worried I might get some freak. I can just imagine that if I had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. Twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I think I still have a few minutes left. I think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. Sometimes they are really, really loud. We used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. Well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. It was in the middle of the night and I heard her running around the house like a freak. Finally I got up to see what was wrong and I took the trap off of her. The mouse appeared to be dead so I put it in a baggy but when I got up in the morning, I found out it was still alive so I tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so I put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. It finally got better so I let it go. I had to let it go far away from my house though  because my mom was afraid it would come back in. My cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in Houston. It was so sad. I cried everyday until we finally found her again. I think my twenty minutes is up now. ",1
"     Right, here I am and I have no idea what I'm doing or supposed   to be doing. I'm sitting here in a computer lab because my parents   thought it would be wise NOT to bring a computer the first semester.    That was a ridiculous thought in my opinion. Of course they also   thought it would be wise not to go to Kansas to see Tony this   summer only because I'd never driven out of state before. That   sucked. And I do feel bad because right after I got up here I went to   spend a couple of days with him. I had tons of fun and I really do   love him. I don't know what my parents problem with him is. I mean,   he's so much like my dad, it's almost scary. Maybe they'll warm up   to him before too long. We do plan on getting married, not soon of   course. Heck, it won't even before for like 4 years. I want to wait til   after I'm out of college because there's less financial worries. And   he's NOT rich at all. But anywho. I don't know. I still haven't told my   parents that I got a speeding ticket on the way home from Kansas.   How am I supposed to explain that when they don't even know I went   to Kansas?  I paid for the ticket myself, but it's still going to show up   on the insurance!  And thank goodness, I found out I'm not pregnant.   That would be another hard thing to explain. I mean, I love Tony and   all, but getting pregnant the first time would have totally sucked!    Plus my dad would have killed us both!  Anywho, I'm so lazy. I still   need to do tons of things. I need to go get my work-study job and a   part-time job so I can have money. I still haven't done either. I don't   know why, it's not like I haven't had time. The only things I've done,   really, is hang out with my cousins every weekend and also go out   and do things with my roommate, Nubia. She's pretty cool. She's   nice, so that's a plus. And we really haven't had any problems. I   was a bit worried about that before I moved up here. I was worried   she might not be quite as nice or considerate as she really is. In   fact, we have a pretty cool arrangement. I can borrow most of her   stuff whenever I want and she can borrow most of mine any time. I   like that. Usually I don't get a long with some people. Or rather they   don't get a long with me. They say I'm too outspoken or something.   I never really know. Dang this room is freezing! I wish I had brought   a jacket up here with me. I have found that most of the buildings   here at UT are kept very cold and I'm not accustomed to that. In fact,   I hate it. Even Bryan and Leslie's house is warmer than this.   Speaking of which, I need to take them out to supper. They are   always letting me stay the weekend and taking me places. The only   thing I've done for them (other than spending their money) is babysit   Londyn and Laurin once. I want to take them somewhere nice to eat   or something. But I don't have a whole lot of money. I also need to   see if Anganette and Jake and Leslie want to get together and do   something.  I had so much fun Saturday and Ange's house; it was a   blast. I never knew croquet could be fun. Though, Bryan and Jake   did also make it pretty violent. Just imagine contact croquet. Yeah, I   have a weird family.   I hope Jessica's doing okay. I know she said   she was fine but still. I mean, I know she probably still is pretty   upset. But I don't really know what to say to her, so I don't say   anything really. I like her, too; she seems really fun to be around and   nice (even if she doesn't think people see her that way). I just   realized, I need to call Windy. I haven't spoken to her since she left   for Houston, and she's like one of my closest friends. I miss a lot of   my friends and family. But I really love it up here in Austin. My   parents always said I'd get really homesick, but so far I haven't.   Maybe it's because I do have family up here. I don't know. Whatever   it is, it's working. Shoot! I just missed my Calculus discussion   group, I think!  I'm going to be so dead. But I really don't know where   it is either. I showed up Tuesday for it, but no one ever showed up. I   checked online and it is at 4:30-5:30 and in the room I waited at.   Maybe they had to do a room change for some reason. I've noticed   in some of my other classes that has happened for the discussion   meetings. I need to get my readings done for psych. , philosophy,   and bio. before I get too behind. I don't want to screw up my   chances at getting into the business school and if I don't keep my   gpa up, that's exactly what's going to happen. Oh, I just   remembered, it's only like 19 days until Tony comes down to see   me. I miss him so much. But I hope he's okay driving that far. He   worries me sometimes. But I know he and I will have tons of fun   when he gets down here. I want to show him the capitol, the history   museum, 6th street, take him on a horse drawn carriage ride (that's   so romantic. . ). I don't know what all else there is to do, but we'll think   of something. Really all we have to do is get on campus and pick a   direction and start walking and we'll come to something! ",1
"Ok, it is 2:02 in the morning and I don't even know why I am doing this assignment --- I just spend over an hour doing the experiment pretesting and I should have gone to bed before I even started doing that, considering the faxct that it is not due for a while. but, I guess it is good that I did it now cause I tend to procrastinate and I probably would have ended up on the due day trying to get connected to the sight and have 40 million other people trying the same thing --- connecting to these sights are so ridiculous - it was impossible to get through the ut main sight to register for classes -- I'm spelling sight the wrong way, I think - spelling is one of my worst subjects, derek always makes fun of me for the way I spell and how I am the only graduate of high school who can't spell the simplest words (for example, that one!)  he also laughs cause I always say periferial vision the wrong way --- he's so smart, he makes me sick, I don't know what I would do if I were that smart - I guess that I could do anything that I wanted to, and I guess he sort of does too, he went to school last year and partied all the time and still got higher than a 3. 5 - that's what I got in high school, and I admit that I didn't study, but I also didn't go out every night - I guess I just procrastinated and pretended like I had more to do than I really did, but then all of the work piled up and I really did end up to have lots to do, but I also let the work pile up because I was talking to derek on the phone ---- my parents almost killed me because of the phone bill, and made me pay for it - and it was so expensive! my phone bill is already going to be skyrocketting and I have only been here for a week and a half, but most of it is to my parents, so that will be acceptable to them cause they were the ones who wanted to find out what rush was and how it went and they wanted every single detail, so I guess I can't really get in trouble!  ok, it is 2:09 and I don't have anything to write about already - I guess I have a short attention span casue this was fun at first and now I would rather go and call derek and talk to him on the phone, or check my email or something - I am so proud that I am actually trying to do my work ahead of time, then again this is the fun homework and I always get the fun stuff done first and then have all of the bad and boring stuff left till the end - if I type fast, which I think I do, I am going to have ended up typing a lot more stuff in 20 minutes than other people would have, and that's not really fair, but that's ok, cause I talk a lot and am sure that I will find stuff to talk about even if it is not in any kind of readable and understandable form ---- I don't like puncuation - I just like dashes like a thought afterwards or something, though that is normally what it is, I also don't like to capitalize a lot if I am writing something really fast and not stopping, so that is why this is not capitalized and has lots of hyphens, they are just more fun --- I wonder who was the first person who evewr thought to make little faces out of the symbols on the keyboard, I mnean, who sits down at his/her computer and looks at all of the punctuation keys, ect. and thinks, oh that would make a smiley face, ect?  the icq smiley faces are better than the ones on aol cause they automatically turn into the stereotypical yellow smiley face instead of the actual punctuation marks - derek bought boxers with me that were joe boxer once, and that was kind of embarrasing cause there was an old lady right there and I didn't want her to think that we were doing inappropriate things and that I was just used to seeing his boxers all of the time, so I pretended I was his sister, though that's what I feel like anyway - we have known eachother for so long, told eachother so many things, and done so much with each other that we are just like brother and sister - I don't know what I am going to do next year, I guess I can just I'm him, but that's never as good as talking on the phone and the international calls would get me killed, but I can't stand the thought of not hearing his voice and all of the different inflections therein!  how sad! I guess I won't think of that for now, but that's just going to make it worse next year, but then again, maybe we will have gotten in some huge fight and not be talking by then, which would of course e bad, but on the other hand, it could be good cause then I would not be wishing that I was talking to him - ok, I forgot what time I started writing this and it is 2:18 I think it was 2:05 - oh no I think it was 2:02 --- I am going to cheat and stop to look at what time it is for the sake of my poor hands that are getting ready to fall off - I need to get back into the habit of typing, though it was so hard for me not to be typing in classes today and yesterday - I have no hope of keeping up while I am taking notes by hand, I am just not used to it - there was one guy in my chem class taking notes on his laptop, so maybe I'll bring mine next time so that I will actually leave with good notes, but chem is the worst class to bring the laptop to cause there are lots of charts and drrawings ect. that take me too long to do on the laptop that I would have to do on paper, leave space on the word processor, print it out and then copy the picture back to the other sheet, but I don't htink I would do that, or I guess that I would wnat to - iam getting sleepy and want to go to sleep - my roommate goes to bed too early and has classes too early and I feel badly keeping her up, but she said that she was a night person and I todl her that I definitely was, and I guess she'll have to get used to it, but I still feel badly --- it is now 2:22 and I forgot to look and see waht time I started so I guess I willl look now and if it was at 2:02 I will not write any more and if it was at :05 then I will have 3 minutes left to write - is that right? I am so bad at mental math - derek is so good at it, he makes me sick - I can't do anything in my head and he can do more in his head than I can with the calculator, but that's ok I can do things that he can't so I guess we have to even out sometime - I guess that I will check the time now.

"ok, right now I feel tired and annoyed. maybe because I just broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months but maybe its because I couldnt get this website to work forever or the fact that I went to bed at two for no reason. putting the tired aside, I'm also pretty exited. my brother is teaching me how to solve a rubiks cube. I love doing things like that, but sometimes I give up too easily. not now though, I can't. not about the rubiks cube, but about the business school that everyone I talk to feels the need to tell me how difficult it is to get in,  but I'm not giving up. I'm trying to adjust to austin and its really not that hard, I just don't want to call it my home because its not- I've lived in houston my entire life. that's my home. even though I was raised in houston, ill end up in colorado. I feel like I'm trying to make conversation to a comuter which doesn't really work so ill just tell you about me. I love the color blue-any shade of blue, I love them all. I love cold weather even though I don't know what its like to be in a snow storm or shovel snow to get out of the driveway. I want a big truck when I'm old-not to show off but to be comfortable. I want to work, not be a housewife even though I do want kids maybe two or three. I admire my mom. she struggles and I love her. I was raised mormon even though I am not mormon anymore. I love dave matthews and sarah maclaclan  thier perceptions of life are awesome  I love songs that hit me right in the heart whether its an uplifting song or not. I love writing even though it takes me forever to write something worth reading. I like kissing. only when its sweet and meaningful for him and me. I love being a friend. helping those that I care about-it just makes me tingle inside. even though I wasnt always like that. I used to have the best scream. I was a selfish kid. I threw fits. I'm better, now I like to share. I didnot smile until I was two. sometimes I worry I have a bad heart because I can randomly have my heart go wild (literaly)  I wonder sometimes too if I got my moms manic depression. I'm not a sad person overall but I can be a lot. I always wondered how that worked too. maybe this course will help me understand. I like beer, but not too much. I used to drink to get my mind of things, now I realize that was dumb. now I write to get it off my chest. what do I think about?  god. the world. people. why?  I don't stand up to my dad even though my front pretends I do. I really just avoid him. his wife is evil, but her kids are the best. how do things like that work out? I have four brothers and a sister. I love them all. they are all so interesting and so individualistic. I have an ex boyfriend named ben that I am obsessed with and so does my roomate, mary. we both wore the same prom dress and bought the same bedding even though we did not shop together. I want her dad to mary my mom  hes neat. he writes for the houston chronicle and my mom is an english teacher. even though it wasnt her choice. she had to start working to be financially stable to avoid my dad. that s why I'm determined to make it in the business school and not be a housewife and drive a big truck.

"well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were """"men"""". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 18 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now.

"I guess the way I feel right now is overwhelmed. I just came back from a class of 540 students, which is double the number of kids in my whole graduating class. Although there are many students here who are so excited to be away from home and all on their own I wouldn't mind going back home and staying their for a while. I am very pleased with my life at home and this sudden change has left me to start all over. Although I know this is a part of life I feel as thought I am losing some of my childhood friends yet no one is replacing them. At first I told myself that is just how I feel and if those childhood friends felt the same then I might be right but this whole summer all of my high school friends were ready to leave for college. Now that we are all separated we understand how much we depended on each other. I have been here three days and everyday for at least an hour I have talked to my friend back home. I guess what scares me the most is that when you meet someone here you have no idea where they came from, where they have been, or what type of person they are. Back at home we all knew each others families, knew what type of person they where etc. I can truly same that moving to Austin has definitely made me reevaluate myself. Not to be cocky but back at home everyone knew who I was and what type of person I was, but here everyone thinks I am a nobody. I feel as thought I have to impress someone for him or her to approach me where at home others approached me. I guess the comfort of home was my stability and now that I am here I have to build a new foundation to start from. I am very great full that there is one other person from my school here because we are together all the time and it makes this transition just a bit easier. Now that we have started classes I am trying to busy myself with my work, which is, a good thing and then it seem as thought time goes by a lot faster. I think I just have to mental got myself ready for this semester and then I will be fine. I do like challenges and that is why I came to this university but the challenges I expected are not the ones I am having trouble adjusting too. It is completely different aspects of college life that has thrown me off. ",0
"Stream of Consciousness Where could she have gone? She has been gone for 12 hours now and she did not even tell me where she was going. She left at 1:30 in the morning and it is now one in the afternoon. All she said was she was going to buy cigarettes and she would be back in fifteen minutes. Oh God what could have happened to her. I do not know what I would do with out her. Rally what would I do if she wasn't around anymore. She is my best friend, my sister. We have been through so much together. She knows everything. Every secret, every feeling, every lie, every cry, everything. Please be okay, please be okay. Where could she have gone? She could have gone to A&M to see Adam. Or maybe she went to Waco to visit Mark. No she wouldn't do that; she has not talked to Mark since Monday. She wouldn't just leave without telling me where she was going. Maybe she went to see Charlie at Southwest. No, she couldn't have. They were in a fight last time she talked to him. Please just be safe. I am totally helpless right now. I have called everyone and left everyone messages. Who is going to call her mother? I have to tell her. No one else can do it. She is my mom too. I am the only one close enough to her to tell her what is going on here. She is there, in Houston, and she is going to freak out when she finds out here daughter has been missing for 12 hours now. I hope Susan is all right. I am going to be so relieved when I see her, if I see her. Relived, I am going to be pissed. How could she not call and tell me where she was going? It is the responsibility of a roommate to tell the other one where you are going. Who else can I call? I have to call somebody. Somebody has to know her whereabouts. I can't ever talk to anyone right now. I am hysterical. Calm down; just clam down, Cara. Everything is going to be okay. Should I wait to call her mom until after I talk to the police? NO that is wrong. It would be one in the morning when the police would finally do something. She couldn't do anything then. She would be as helpless as I am right now. That is not fair to her. She wouldn't be able to do anything at one in the morning. She would be totally freaked out in tears. Okay breathe, breathe. You can do this. Just dial the number. Come on push the buttons. Stop crying and do what you know you have to do. Stop crying, Cara. ",1
"Right now I just sat down to type this psychology paper. This is the first time I have ever typed a paper like this before, with constant writing. I am used to gathering my thoughts, thinking before I speak but now I am writing whatever pops into my mind. I am thinking about how much this different from something I would do in high school; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing. I am hearing the faint sound of the Houston Astros baseball game in the background, I love baseball so much, this the pennant races are incredible. Hopefully I will  get to broadcast the game I love in the future. Well I have an hour until its time to go to work, its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college. Astros, I think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out. I'm enjoying the fact that I am able to do this from my own computer, god I would hate to live in a dorm. Sharing and small places are no fun for me. Looking forward to this weekend, big barbecue put on by my friend Mike; we always have legendary times at those. Its just starting to sink in now as I hear God Bless America in the background that today is September 11. It's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago, it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago. I really don't agree with what is going on in our country right now, by the way. The wind is blowing pretty good outside right now, for some reason I have not opened the blinds in the house yet. I get really lazy when I am at home. Anyway, this a little easier than I thought it would be. It has really gotten me thinking. I mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking, and are we thinking about something all the time? Consciously? Well I think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2, I really hope we don't lose to Milwaukee. Man I don't want to go to work today, although 4-9:30 is not that bad, better than 12-9:30. I feel like I am writing in a journal more than doing a project, that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page. Big props to the person who set that up. I was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment, but I quickly realized that was not necessary. I just found out I have discussion section class for geography. I don't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section? I don't get what that is all about, is it for the TA's to feel important or something? Must be a college thing, I guess. It seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now. I just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that I have about a minute left. I hope I did alright on this, I mean I wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts. P. S (I submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code. My class code is 316 not 315) ",0
"Right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not I just submitted a blank page because I hit the tab button so I could write in paragraph form and then boom. the screen said you have submitted, thankyou. But anyways I hadn't even started. Right now I have no idea what I am supposed to be writing, the assignment seems to easy. Usually that means I'm doing something wrong. Right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write. I feel like I'm in a sort of mellow mood, after all, there's not much excitng going on right know. I have calculus to do and I almost don't want to pick up the book because I know I won't be able to do some, andthen I may get a bad grade on the homework. That means that I will get a bad grade in the class unless I do perfect on the tests. Well, I wish I knew how to type, not that this assignment would go by any faster. Sensations? Well I'm sitting on a chair, I can feel it supporting me. I have this habit of biting my lips, so I can feel that to. Only bite the inside of your lips because then they don't look all messed up all the time. If someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me. I wonder if the box keeps going, yes it does. Wait. agh. a drink of water. More sensations!!  I felt the water coldly flow down my neck where I imagine it's being mixed with luch. which was a 9 inch sub from """"PO Boys?""""  At least it was relatively healthy, but it's more expensive than Wendy's. Oh man I hope that somebody doesn't call because I might have to write this over again. Or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than 10 minutes and not done anything, that would be bad. Does that mean that I would have to go back and write this all over again. Well, I can't wait to get this done because I get to relax for one damn second of the day. I've been up since 7 walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back. It makes me hunch over because if I stand up straight then I would fall over. I hope I don't have a bad back when I'm older. at least I'll be smart. Wow I've already been writing for 15 minutes, probably about the wrong stuff, but hey. Another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard. And I can see the keyboard. My cell phone just rang, I could hear that. Well, anyways, this whole 20 minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about. I wonder what other people wrote, actually I could care less. Their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine, but anyways. I really hope this actually submits. after all, it is the last minute. I'm glad Paul reminded me. ",0
"Right now, I am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small. I am waiting for a phone call that is so important, and if I don't get it, I am going to feel like a really big loser. Yes, I did just get all the blessings I could ever ask for, so I am selfish to be wanting more, but its something I really really want. All I want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about. I have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best, and I get so sick when I let myself down. Rejection sucks. its so hot in here, and as all my friends call because they just got the call,"""" I feel like a loser. I am proud of myself- but rejection is not something I handle well? What if the call does not come-- will I cry, will I blame my inabilities on something else, how will I react? The anxiety I feel right now is extreme. On top of all that, I am homesick. I have a great life here in Austin, but since my family is a huge part of my life, I feel kind of left out being so far away. Everything back home seems to go on without me. my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on. she follows me around and sometimes I feel used because she really does not know people here. She is not in a sorority and so sometimes I feel as if she is angry at me for that. I am so anxious. my boyfriend is supportive too, but I wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me. Yes, I know about his fear of commitment and all that crap, but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him. Oh, that stupid seventh heaven song. turn off the dang tv. All I want is peace and quiet without all the noise. Oh, and I have to worry about yesterday too. My sorority is awesome, but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them. Yes, I know. Its silly if we all drink together. But, sometimes I feel as if I have this image that I have to uphold. and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life. my family, my faith, my school, my friends. How do I act? How do I dress? Who do I associate myself with? All of these things constantly flood my brain, and sometimes all I want to do is get far away from those thoughts. Do people love me for me? Do they love me for who I am here or the grades I make or the house I live in or the money my parents make? How do people view me? And that tv, always on. what I would give for that chatter to stop for 10 minutes. I can't even study with the noise. I am worried about this year. I need a job, I have bills to pay, I am in hard classes. how will I measure up? I love my life, I love my life. but I could seriously do without the stress. I am determined, and I already have accomplished so much this semester, but will it end? I want it to stay this way, but there is so much to lose. I am scared that I will lose it. How do I not lose it? I pray all the time, and I count my blessings. its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint. why did I choose to live in an apartment with a girl I don't like? What possessed me to do this? Did I feel independent and like a big girl? Now I feel young and naive, and way out of my league. oh, the insanity, but good things come to those who wait and I put all my trust into a higher being so things WILL work out. ",1

"College is so cool. I really can't remember the last time I felt so many emotions at the same time. I've already met so many incredible and different people I can't even begin to describe all of them. I am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people I have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. My boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. I hate jealous people I wish everyone would just, I don't know go along with it. I ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that I have already met from camptexas. That was like almost the most fun I've had in a really long time I'm so glad I decided to go and wasn't to scared. I was so scared about coming to UT  because it is so big and I just didn't know if I could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. I'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. High school was such an almost horrible experience, I hope college is so much better. So I'm in this room with these two guys, one who I met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but I have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. He is just the hottest guy I have ever seen. So I met this really cool guy from tarytown in New York which is like the place I've been obssessed with since forever. He is a guy I would really like to hang out with. This other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with Britany Spears I really can't stand her but I think it is just because I am so jealous that he likes her more than me. And Drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and I was just thinking about jealous people. The music is blasting in my ear I don't know who it is. Drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. I really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. Everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates I need a really good girl friend to hang out with. Or maybe I'm just ment to have guy friends. I guess it would be okay with me I get along with  them better. I think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. Which is really a relief because I though it would be really hard. I've seen so many interesting people. I miss my parents like crazy and my dogs and sisters. I would never trade this experience for going to UTEP that would really suck. I really miss my friend Bianca and Anne. I think for labor day we are going to San Antonio if Anne and Lianna and Vero come up. I was thinking about Noodles the other day I wonder how she is. This is got to be one of the funnest assigments I have ever done. I really think I might double major whith something in Psychology because the human mind is an incredible thing. Well my 20 minutes seem to be up that kind of sucks I guess I could really write forever I need to go write my parents and some friends e-mails and then read a little for Biology and probably go to sleep I'm really tired.

"     I'm really not sure what exactly I am suppossed to write about so I thought I would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's September 11th. That morning I woke up and things didn't seem any different. I put on my I love New York shirt and went to class. Truthfully, I was very dissapointed with the people here at UT and how they acted that day. People in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. The tower played American Songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. It was   getting in the way of our discussion.   WHATEVER!!  We should have been discussing September 11!!  One girl in the class said,   Who cares!!  People die every day!!  We kill people in Afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!!    I personally was outraged by that comment. How disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. That night I went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. We stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. It was awesome. To be standing there next to my friends, people that I loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. To hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. And then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. The whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. It was very powerful. You couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in New York who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but WANTING to go in anyways. I had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. Walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. And in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. At the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. I forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. In almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. You couldn't help it. Then the whole crowd sang God Bless America. Hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing GOD BLESS AMERICA was absolutely amazing. I knelt down where I was and said a prayer to thank God for my family and my friends and for the fact that was SO blessed. I picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that I love her. My family is the most important thing in the world to me and if I lost any of them I don't know how I could even go on. When it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. It made me think about the pictures I had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. A very powerful sight. The man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in Pearl Harbor on December 7th. That was an amazing thought to me also. It was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great American tragedy. However, this was a tragedy but not just that. In fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. I saw a commericial that gave me the chills. It was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking American city. The voice in the background said   On September 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change America forever.   The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. The voice said   They succeeded.   I think that is a perfect way to say what September 11 has done for America. Yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in AMerica are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. At this point in my life, I am VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. ",0
"I'm feeling a little stressed right now. I have two tests coming up in about a week and I'm kind of behind on my reading. There is so much stuff to take care of now that I am out on my own. It makes me miss my family; I'm feeling kind of homesick right now. When I woke up this morning I found myself crying. I'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me. It just happens to be my friend's brother so I'm worried about what I should do. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it and I just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me. But, I did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, I'm glad I had someone to talk to.     I'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but I'm not sure because I think I need to stay and study. But, I think I'm going to go anyway because I need a break and I need to feel more involved. Hopefully some people will go. I wonder what I should wear. I want to go shopping, I'm getting tired of always wearing the same things. It kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room. There are still boxes everywhere and I feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but I just don't feel like it. I keep hearing door open in the hall, I wonder if my room mate is back. It's kind of awkward with her here. I don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative. I still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night. Oh well.      I'm watching this movie on TV about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing. I mean I know I'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often. It makes me feel out of shape, I hope that I don't gain a lot of weight because I'm not working out as much. It felt so good to be back in class the other day. I love the Modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free. I guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and I'm one of the most experienced in the class. That kind of makes me relax because I don't get as nervous as I do around all the good dancers in the other classes. I get so nervous at auditions. I don't know how in the world I'm going to get into those major's dance classes. Then what am I going to do?        My RA just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie. I feel kind of stupid going because I've already been and my friends aren't going. But, oh well, I guess that I will just go. I feel like I need to meet more people. The only people I've have hung out with while I have been here are Rockport people. I thought I was going to get away from all that, but I don't know. I don't know what to write anymore. I'm thinking to hard about this and I know I shouldn't be. I should just type whatever it is that I am thinking.      The time is almost up. It went by surprisingly fast and I kind of enjoyed doing it. It actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. It's weird how writing can do that; Professor Pennebaker did mention that in my class. I guess it really is true. I feel like I should have an ending to this. But, I guess not. I guess your thoughts never really end. It kind of makes me nervous when I can't think of what to write. What does that mean?  It's kind of like when I blank out talking to people which I seem to do a lot. I'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. I wonder what the point of it is. ",1
"Right now I am feeling kind of loney because I haven't really talked to anybody for about 6 hours. I'm not the kind of person who usually keeps to myself. I am very social, but with the size and and stress of college life, making friends is kind of the last thing you want to think about. Even if you do make friends sometimes you never really keep in touch with them. I'm guessing that I'm not the only one to feel like this beacause every day as I walk from class to class I see hundreds of other students walking by themselves and I can only guess that they too feel lonley at some point in the day. Also, I;m starting to think that college life isn't what I expected to be. In a way it is kind of easy because there are no eight hour class days for most people like in high school, but because of the size of some of my classes I don't really get the kind of personal attention I would get in high school. all the time I hear music in my head. It can range from something I just heard on MTV a couple of hours ago to some classical music or something we played in my high school band. Music is a big part of my life. In high school I was in the band for four years and other than making me a better player, it also made me more social and open with my feelings. I wanted to get into band over her at UT, but I never auditioned. I didn't think I was ready. I didn't think that I would be on the level of the rest of the members, and that fear was partly why I never tryed out. I want to try out next year but I have no instrument to practice on because it is too expensive to purchase. I don't consider my lonliness to be a bad thing because I'm not really sad. While in college I learned that sometimes you need your own time to just relax and think to yourself. All in all I'm happy with the way my life is going because I know that in the future college will pay off. ",1
"clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it. - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it. hmmmm its 20* degrees celcius right now. that does not even really matter, I prob. won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something. spike tv. what kinda dumb sh** is this. this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv"""" - 20 minutes is a long time to be typing. I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are. better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out. is that possible. yeah. school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point. I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico. I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was. where do all these """"personal type surveys"""" going. is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools. if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid. hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions. I think that job would be pretty boring. I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy. that is prob. why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing. I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity. that would suck. it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was """"mentally handicapped"""". I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else. its crazy to be alive and conscious. consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation. joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy. I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. I can't really think of what to say. I need a cigarette to calm me down. that is not even how you spell """"cigarette"""" but spelling is not even that important. I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar. but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled. that kinda shit pisses me off. need a smoke.

"Hi, I have no idea what I'm going to write but who cares, here goes. I'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of Jester West, across the where I now reside, in Jester East, doing a writing assignment for Psychology on what comes in to my mind first. Well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. I've been away from books and studying for 2 3/4 years now, and 1 week into UT and 5 classes and 16credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that I have to do right now. I've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. Basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. And the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! Damn, now I know why americans are so rich. Nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. Not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now I guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after I complete this assignment, and maybe the next. Thoughts, Ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. Well I'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, I thihnk, I did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??Jerk!  Now, let's get on to sensations. Hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. Sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. Nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. Well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. A result of chatting last night with my roommate till 1am and waking u p this morning at 7. damn, really hate early mornings, I'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. Calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. But what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? Really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 20 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata! ",1
"I'm watching my breath. Listening to it enter and exit my body. It is quiet. There is a bit of tension in my sinuses and my jaw is slightly tightened as well. my mind is quiet. Now I am back in pennebaker's class on Wednesday. I'm sitting in this incredibly crowded room with over five hundred students in it. Someone is sitting on the floor. Pennebaker has a microphone! The feelings of being back at school again. It is nice for this to be semester number two at UT. It's easier to get around. But still a shock to be back on campus with fifty thousand other humans after spending a month hiking in the mountains on the other side of the world. All of the traffic: cars, bikes, pedestrians, are such a foreign scene after the solitude of the mountains. Although this scene is not so different from the crowded streets of Delhi, India. My memories of the mountains in nepal continue to surface. Different parts of the trip. I remember so much so vividly. The day that ramesh and I left kag beni for jomsom and walked along the river. It was wide and roaring. The wind blew hard. At times the river bed was so wide that we could walk along the dry part of it. I hummed """"Dust in the Wind"""" by Kansas feeling the immensity of this land and the tiny insignificance of my small person as I walked through it. A little bit frightening, a little bit mystifying, a little bit liberating. Now we're in Jomsom, waiting for a plane that will come and leave again without taking us back to Pokhara. We are sitting with a bunch of old Nepali men who are chatting about the dangers of the planeor so I figured, they spoke only in Nepali. I feel an odd bond with these old men that I cannot understand. They are part of me. There's a monk waiting for the plane as well and when it comes, takes some passengers and leaves us behind, he, along with ramesh and I decide to walk back to Pokhara. The stress of traveling in a foreign country that has a different perception of time is difficult to adjust to. Ramesh and I are driving on his motorbike toward Kathmandu from Pokhara. Monsoon rains have caused landslides along the road and we cannot pass. There are many people waiting to pass, including many distraught westerners. The urge to become stressed out is very strong, but I have to smile. What am I worried about? Things will work out. Now I am home, back to the fast paced society where I have spent most of my life. In the airport in Detroit, the first thing I notice is how fastpaced everything is. People all seem to be in a hurry. I practice Buddhist meditation and this helps me to focus my mind and not run off with all of the stresses and worries that are present each day. But what makes us live in this way? We move so fast that often we are not able to enjoy the life that is right in front of us. I return to the mountains. Now I am on Poon Hill. The first morning that I have seen the Annapurnas. It's really early and the sun is rising over the mountains. We're sitting on a picnic table that looks out on an immense valley that meets the grand peaks. I can sit here all day. I feel so open and expansive. Now we're in Tatopani. Ramesh, Dhundup and I are staying at a lodge right next to the hot springs which we enjoyed earlier. Now it's dinnertime and we're sitting on the patio, drinking hot tea and cold Fanta. Ramesh and I are playing chess. I don't know how to play, but am excited about surrendering my fear and trying something new. As I walked up to the table, Ramesh's smile lit up his entire face and my entire insides. As we play chess, we continue to exchange looks that are full of energy. Three weeks later, when I finally depart Pokhara, I blow him a kiss as I get on the plane. So many incredible new experiences that have molded and shaped my life in amazing new ways. When thinking about this trip, I feel open and expansive in a new way. I feel incredibly happy. I deserve to feel happy after the struggles of the spring of this year. Oh, and my time was up. Until next time! ",1
"     I thnik that after this I'll do my chemistry homework and get it out the way. It will probably take me forever eventhough it's only 10 questions because I still need to read. My Incubius CD is ending. I need to ask Christina to start it again. I am wonder how I'm going to really learn how to speak Latin. I know I'll be able to read and Write it. When is my computer going to come in?  I feel like I'm intruding on Christina everytime I use her lap top. I'm drawing a blank. Get up Tina. I'm never good at this stream of thought stuff cause I'm always thinking about the stream of thought like in english class last year when Mrs. Posern asked us to do it for. . I guess it was ten minutes. I miss her. I miss Clinton and Pakey. I wonder what Pakey's doing right now. Probably out somewhere in Houston. I love this song. I really want to play guitar. I hope I make the band next year. That dream was wierd last night or this morning or something like that. Singing would be so often for a living. I've always liked being on the go constantly. I'm so organized and yet never organized enough. I wanna' here my song again. That's so wierd, when one song is on you can't think of another on. Those girls next door were really loud earlier today. What were they doing?  I don't dress up very much. I still don't understand how people can where heels to an amusement park. Six Flags was fun this summer. I love this song. I'd love to see them live. I wonder what there like in person. He has such an amazing voice.  I wonder how my voice would improve if I were to take lessons. I need to exercise more. That would definitly improve my lung capcity and my playing. I'm so upset I didn't make the band. I'm proud of myself though because I sightread music while everyone else had had their music for a whie. What am I going to play next year for an audition. I don't know. I need to practice again. Is my music here?  I need to send the pool key to my mom. I also need to find a church before my mom kills me. I want to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Maybe we'll go sometime this week. I don't know. How much time left. Okay. Um. I did a really. times up. ",1
"I'm curious to know whether or not there is or isn't a timer in this program and if it were possible to just quit typing and claim that 20 minutes have passed. My thoughts and emotions concern my future and what I'm going to do. Do I really want to be a psychology major or am I just saying that because it sounds cool. I want to counsel, but id really like to make a ton of money. Maybe everyone is right, I should be a business major, that's what everyone else is doing. But I don't want to deal with  that crap for the rest of my life. I think its boring and stupid. The future is such a difficult concept to ponder. Sometimes I have different goals for it. should I try to satisfy myself, friends or family?  I mean it when I tell my friends that I want to be a professional wrestler, it looks so stinking fun. Just jumping around and bad acting. Well, an acting career would be nice too, but I'm to shy and insecure for that. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't want to associate myself with the thespian weirdoes. I don't think id be able to be my best if I had a problem fitting in with  weirdoes. Maybe I'm the weirdo. nah. probably not. I may be stereotyping them, but, hey, they're weird man. I've seen the way they act. They put the stereotype on themselves. I'm sure there's a couple nice ones though. I wonder if all the famous actors were at one time like that. My mind just drifted to Tricia. She sent me a message saying that she had a couple of dates this past weekend. I wonder how true that is. Of course its true, but its weird how she never dated in high school and then all of a sudden at A&M she's a hot item. I still think about that monster crush I had on her my sophomore yr. I wonder if she liked me too. Everyone thought she did. But I never had the balls to find out for myself. I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life. I'm such a fucking pussy. The same thing last yr. If I had the balls, I think I could have got something started with  Erica at Baylor. Instead, now, we're just good friends. I could have used some support too. But that fucking Ray would have been too jealous if Erica and I got something started. That prick, I think he could've hooked me up with  Courtney too. But he needed her, if not, who would he use to cheat on his girlfriend???  Then her roommate, Darla, man, she's such a little bitch. The thing is, she's not even pretty man. Its okay to be snobby and bitchy if your hot, but she was an ugly little girl, with  nothing to show for herself. Amazing how she was dating all the time. Then her fucking attitude about how she has the perfect mate in mind, but wants to date, because its part of the  college experience. Ray thought like that too. That's such a fucking crock man. As Christians they shouldn't be thinking like that. if this almighty god already picked out the perfect mate for them, there is no reason for them to date around to have fun. They love justifying things. There is something wrong with  what your doing fi you have to justify it man. And then ray went to that Mexico trip to witness to a bunch of poverty stricken Mexicans. Its funny how he couldn't convert me to Christianity in 9 months, but he thinks he can do a whole Mexican community within a couple of weeks. I guess its easier when you feed them and shit. talk about taking advantage of people. Why don't these gung-ho Christians go witness to the people who really """"need Jesus""""  They should make mission trips to Washington D. C. and talk to the politicians. they're the fucking sinners man. and the business people too. they're the ones fucking this world up. working for Satan. They don't want to witness to them because they're smarter than them, and they can't find a way to take advantage of them. Christianity is fucked up sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite for going to CBS, but if I didn't I wouldn't know anyone. They're nice and I enjoy being there. But most people there have less of a commitment to god than I do, so oh well. I'm glad I'm at UT though. its way better than Baylor, god, I used to get so depressed there. but I'm proud of myself, I toughed out that bullshit. I miss a lot of the guys though. It was a different sort of friendship, but it was cool. I still wonder if I would've stayed if my 1st semester was like the 2nd. but then again I was about to go crazy towards the end. Jesse and Miguel. and big John almost killed me!!  I hope I date here. I think that's all I need to be happy. a good woman. I'd like to have what lijay has, or anything really. I think I'm the only one in our click rite now without someone to """"talk to"""". times up. . ",0
"     My roommate is throwing gummy bears at me. My favorite flavor is the pineapple ones. My roommate is rambling. Pineapples make me think of he beach. The Bahamas. White sand, clear water. I am thirsty. I don't drink enough water during the day. I hear slaming doors, faint radio tunes threw the walls. My window is huge and the view is of a tree. I hear water flowing. My feet are cold. They are always cold. The enter key keeps getting stuck on the keyboard. I need to grease it I guess. I hate greasy fried foods. Dinner tonight was not to great in Kinsolving. I hear a cell phone ringing. I wish I had more minutes on my cell phone. I see the room phone ringing now. The door just opened. Tulips are my favorite flower. They only grow during certain seasons. I with I had tulips. They don't last as long as roses or carnations. Chi O's flower is a carnation. Carnations are funeral flowers. Why does it always rain at funerals. I haven't been to a funeral in several years. I can't spell. The shift key keeps getting stuck too. I hope I get to be on the Diamonds. I need to apply. I miss Cody. He is coming soon. I hope he gets here early. I wonder how Kristin did on her interview. I am sure she was fantastic. I hope she liked Houston better. I hear cars outside. My feet are freezing. I have socks on. my socks are dirty. There are grammer mistakes in this writing. I hope I get to go to church Sunday. I miss my old church. I need to pray more. Man Im glad we are still friends. The game is going to be fun. Do i need to get there early. I wonder where my cousin lives. I wonder what he would have cooked for us. What ever it was, I'm sure it would have been better than what I ate. I can't believe he called me. When will I go home. When will I find a place i like to study. When will this place feel homey. I need to cut my nails. It is hard to type. I need a pedicure too. Ther're my favorite. I like the chairs you sit in. They put me to sleep. I never know how much to tip the woman that works on my nails. My back doesn't hurt. I can't believe it. This chair is hard. I liked stud    ",1
"so, what am I suppose to write about? I guess just anything huh. well , there are too much things for me to do this week, so many things. I have voluntary works to do, lots of school works are due by the end of the week, still lots of meetings for organizations and clubs. Also I have to work too. that takes up a lot of time, it seems like everytime there's a meeting they are all bunched together on Tue and Weds, which I can never attend because of work. Sometimes I really wonder if work is really that important that I have to make it all the time, it seems like no one really cares if you do show up or not, you just clock in and find something to do. I don't even have a real job to do yet, I've been doing a lot of different stuff, just wherever they need me. I don't even think the people there knows me at all. I'm pretty new so I guess after a while they will know me. I thought about just skipping work a couple times , but I think I better not. but after I show up to work , there's really nothing to do. they could handle the stuff without me, so then I feel like I should have just skipped work. I forot what time I started writing, I wonder how do they know how long I've been writing. oh , I just got something cool from my ra, and a call for me to go shopping and meet people, cool, so I guess I have to go even though I haven't been writing for twenty minutes, but this thing is pretty long already so I guess it won't matter that much. well, the more I look at it , it seems kinda short! well but I really have to go, what should I do??? YIkes, well I wonder if I can come back later and continue to write , but I don't think that's possible because that just voids the purpose of stream of con. for 20 minutes huh. but I really have to go. so I guess I'll cheat this time. but I'll write longer on the next assignment to make it up I guess.

"     Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, """"How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?""""  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. Its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one. The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school. Its a real drag. I'm always so tired I hate it. Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. Maybe I'll go visit Brett (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, College Station, the drive is a drag though. The road trip that me and Lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. All they're concerned about is putting UT down or """"TU"""" as they call us since we're not """"THE"""" University of Texas but """"A"""" Texas University!  Isn't it stupid. Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. They do have a lot of school spirit. Makes me wish that I was into that stuff. Who knows, maybe when all the football games start. I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get. I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out. I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready. My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself. I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform. How amazing. That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team. I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. I love it. There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management. The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going. I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an """"all out"""" fan of theirs. But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. Its worth the experience. ",1
"     I was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because I've never really done anything like this. So i decided to put it off until the last minute. It is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. Im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. So far I havent really met any new people that I would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. I think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending UT. It is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. Although I know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. I don't know I guess will just have to see how things turn out. One thing that I am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. In fact she is a mere stones throw away in LLD. She means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. I mentioned LLD well that is a girls dorm, near LLB which is my dorm Whitis court that I now call home. Whitis is a nice little community although I don't much enjoy some of the company here. The rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in Jester. However its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. It seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. I guess its just one more thing Ill have to get used to. Not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. I am also planning on joining the Marine Corps and going to the PLC course this summer. It is a big step  in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. My father was a marine and his father was in the army and I feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. One thing that I would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. Me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. It seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. I know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. Hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. He came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. I really do love and care for my family but I believe they think much to the contrary. I guess I don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. This short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much I miss them. ",0
"I feel somewhat confident but also unsure about myself entering college. I am  excited about what might become of this expeience and oppotunity but am also  somewhat unsure about some of the greater unknowns out there on a university  cmapus. I am sitting in a some what comfortable chair and that is quite  relaxing although I shoulnd't be so concerned with feelings although they are  important but they can get you into trouble and can misled you sometimes. This  psychology course should be an interestingone and I am looking forward to  learning about personality especially . I have a somewhat usual but unusual  personality,  I feel proud about that which I probably shouldn't because  anything that I have is a gift endowed by the Creator. Pride is something that  creeps into me and this disappoints me when I see it evident in my life  everything that I have is from God ultimately and so I shouldn't have any reason  to be proud of something That God has given to me while I have done some of the  work in the eternal scopeof thing s I will alos be held accountable for any  gifts that I have received. this assignment is somewhat interesting although it  is not sometying that I have done very often I don't like to do things new  naturally but there is something of a Holy Spirit power that has recently  enabled me to do things that I normally wouldn't have had the strength to do pon  my own strength. I think that the truth of Jesus Christ is the most amazing  thing that I have ever encountered I also feel the same way about it . There is  a lonely feeling that tends to pervade me right now but this is soon wiped away  by the invocation of the All- Holy Name ofJesus. Personality is utterly  intriguing I think because it can teeel us so much about people and understand  why we have tendencies to do the things that wed do. I don't really like pearl  jam  but I do like classicla music and I love this group called third Dayu. College is such an interesting concept that it comes at a time that we are  learning to think about things for ourselves and discerning truth from lie. This is a much greater method on the whole than havingh someone else think for   you lest it be God seeing to it how He is the only One that knows all andcan  never err. Truth seeking must be doen in a very humble frame of mind though fo  rif we expect more than we humans are capable of or wait to long to make a  decision, seeing how life is so sort and essential we could die at any time as f  ar as we know. The clock says that I am completed with 19 minutes of the  proposed 20 and I don't know if that is good or bad because I rather enjoyed  this assignment seeing to the fact that I got to talk about some of the thing s  tha t enter my mind sometimes peroidically and sometimes frequently. it is  interesting to observe radom thoughts and frequency of thought and how many  mistakes I amke on the keyboard wh ",0
"     I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"""" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, """"yeah I party"""", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about """"friends"""" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch """"joey"""" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the """"brady bunch"""" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. Elizabeth Chandler Albert. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 1997. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  Hillary. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later ",1
"So here goes. I am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff. It seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time I have to complete everything just keeps shrinking. I hope and pray that as time goes by I will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life. It has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work. But as my brother once told me, you must work hard in order to play hard. I'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly, and keep thinking positive about my situation. I'm hoping that I can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come. Well enough about that. I'm really starting to miss my family a lot. I think that is really lame but I can't help it really. Like I love Austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of Sunnyvale, Texas that I miss incredibly. I went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends. Gosh I love my friends here but its just not the same. There is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave. But I know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals. And UT is the place to do it. I love this place! The people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change. I am so excited about this weekend! One of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and I keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend! Gosh you know what. I'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15"""" theory! Because I sure do eat a lot these days. The food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist! Its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you. No here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it! Its great! Its amazing to me how different college life is from high school. Like in high school everyone cared about everyone else's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here. No one cares about anyone else's business at all. people are just concerned with themselves. And another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules! Like you can do whatever the heck you want and NO ONE will tell you that you are wrong or that you can't do something. Oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking, you can! I laugh every time I see people doing that in my classes. I would never be able to make myself do that because I'm too much of a chicken but I think its so funny! Gosh. I'm really starting to get hungry again. that is so bad! NO! I can't eat again! I am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm. that is really late and I'm extremely tired! I really hope that I can find a date to Anchors Away. that is really bugging me. I wish I knew exactly who I wanted to take and who wanted to go so that I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore! Alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so I'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me. haha! This was good. its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once. I actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper. Not to mention that I feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing I have to worry and stress out about. Well that is all I have to say for myself at this point and time! Peace! ",0
"I can overhear the sound of my roommate watching television. Right now he is watching sesame street, it is a pretty funny show to watch for a little while every now and then. The muppet characters are quite ridiculous. I am kind of hungry, perhaps I can cook some bagel bites after I am done with this writing assignment. Last night I went shopping at target to get items for my dorm room. Me and my roommate ended up spending a ton of money, but everything we got is going to be very useful over the next few months living in the dorm. Today has been a very relaxing day, as I have no classes on thursday. The program on television just changed to Barney and Friends, they are singing the song The noble duke of york"""", I remember this song from my youth, my mom used to sing it to me when I was young. I had forgotten the song until just now when Barney reminded me of how the song goes. Damn, I just finished my Dr. Pepper, and there are no more in the refrigerator. I guess I'll have to put more in when I'm done with this. Children's programming is so ridiculous, it seems like they aren't trying to teach the kids at all but rather try to impress certain things on them. Well my roommate just turned of the TV so no more children's programming for me I guess. Now I am listening to Tomahawk, a very good band, I went to a show of theirs a while ago, it was the best concert I've ever seen. It was them playing with the Melvins and Dalek. I think Dalek is playing sometime in Austin soon, I want to go see that show too. Dalek was alright but not nearly as awesome as Tomahawk or The Melvins. I feel kind of hot, we need to get another fan for our room. I bought this printer a few days ago from the campus computer store and it didn't come with a USB cable, so I couldn't hook it up to my computer. What is the point in having a printer if you can't plug it into anything? So I had to go back to the store and buy another cable. The campus computer store really pisses me off with their horrible service. I was thinking about how a person blind from birth could have no comprehension of sight. I think it would  be cool to make a movie about this concept. Too bad I don't have the means of making a movie. I think I could make some really interesting movies if given the opportunity. But I am sure most people think the exact same thing, everyone thinks their own ideas are the greatest ever. This led me to wonder if there are other sense which are superior to sight which are just as hard for us to comprehend as sight would be to someone who has never seen. Wow Tomahawk is really good band, I hadn't listened to their new cd in a long time and now that I am listening to it again I remember how much I like them. I wish I had more confidence in myself. I have no real reason to lack confidence, I want to be more confident but it seems everytime I am put in a situation where I would need to display confidence I choke. It seems like it is my body's natural reaction to get nervous. My brain  sees no logical reason to be nervous yet my body makes me choke up, its very frustrating. Oh well, its not that big a deal, I think my confidence has improved greatly over time. El cordobes: ameniza el espectaculo una brillante banda de musica. ",0
"Homework, I hate homework. no it's not that. It's more like I hate the  obligation to be busy that it entails. Why is it that after finishing homework or exercises that you feel so great, but actually starting it is so stressful. Why is it that something that is so helpful is hard to motivate?  One would  think that lazy people would have been weeded out by natural selection by now  and it'd be easier for those left behind to get motivated. But from what I've  seen in the history texts, people aren't only not more motivated, they're less!! So if this goes on, it'll get harder and harder for people to get things done. And I'm already having enough problems as it is!   It makes me wonder if the human  race will survive to see a true 'space age'?  I mean, We've made so much  progress in that area already, but at the rate that apathy and disinterest that  sweeping through the population, it's quite possible that we'll never get off of our own little mudball in order to see what the other little mudballs circling a bunch of burning hydrogen look like. Not only that, but what about all these  alien theory's?  There is a truism (called that 'cause they're normally true)  that says, """"There is a seed of truth even in the most outrageous rumor""""  So I  want to know what that seed of truth is!!  What, or who, is out there. If it's nothing, I want to find out. So maybe in my lifetime there will not be any  answers, but from heaven or hell or wherever I go, if indeed I go anywhere other than the ground, I want someone to somewhere figure out the answer!  Or that  there is not an answer. Oh, well. I think my twenty minutes are up. So  hopefully what little motivation I've mustered will result in more than just a  good grade (although that's good too!)

They are playing OU as I write this and I am hoping that they loose. I keep telling myself to hope that they win but deep down I really want them to loose. When they win his main concern is football and when they loose he concentrates more on me. Is this some psychotic way of wanting to control him?  I know that if they win then he will seem more appealing to other girls. This makes me extremely jealous and insecure. Adrian is my first love. He is the first person I ever really cared about. I don't know if I am wasting my time in this long distant relationship though. There are so many more important things that I should be worrying about right now in my life. I am in my prime. I am terrified of getting hurt. I'm scared that I am going to put effort into this relationship only to get screwed over in the end or in a time when I really need him. I can almost see history repeating itself:  in high school I stood beside Adrian when he was a dork and always sat the bench in football then when he got good and things took a turn in my life to where I needed someone there for me we was too good. I still have a tremendous amount of anger towards Adrian for the things he did to hurt me. This relationship is not good for me right now in many ways but I'm am too scared of loosing the only person in the world that I would be willing to lay down my life for. I don't know if I am being insecure about our relationship because of things Adrian has done in the past or because I feel insecure about myself and in some way feel like I am not worthy of someone liking me. ,0
"Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my hometown of Grapevine, Texas, where I get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. I guess I'm looking forward to the weekend, however I realize that I am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at UT. Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time. To tell you the truth, I really don't know why I do. One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. I just saw the MTV music awards, which was ok. I mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. Some bands these days I can hardly consider a """"band"""" in the least sense of the word. I just remembered that I missed my SI meeting tonight. that which I am not too happy about, but I shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. Sometimes I wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. I mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent THAT bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. I've been to other places and apartments, and I think I still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that I recieved. I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. I get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. I'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, I'll be up for a while. Sometimes I wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. In this summer alone, 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 2 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. It's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. Luckily I was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. I never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. I mean what can you say?? I'm sorry?  you'll do better next time?? hardly. It feels like I'm typing into a diary or something. which I don't keep. I really want to go see some live bands here in austin. I mean it IS supposedly the Live Music Capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 6th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else I could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. Overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really REALLY cold. man is it cold. I wish I had something to eat as of right now. I'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. Some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. I hate doing laundry. I especially hate ironing. but I guess they're something that I'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. I think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. It just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right?  Some people I know take it way to the extreme. I wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now I'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl?  who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy/girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. I guess it wasnt """"weird. """" just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool I guess. now I also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that I would be detained by the FBI for some criminal knowledge that I may possess for some odd reason. who knows.

"why am I being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how I feel and know it to be. because I have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that I am mistaken, but I do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this I know. what to do about it? I don't. these negative things come to mind whenever I am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. I have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of """"natural"""" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. I don't appreciated being forced to submit and I emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. I could and do this often on my own time. but I am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? I don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. I have few things of value in this world, but I do have my mind and my intellectual property. I do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a PhD. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a """"serious"""" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, I suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? I don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if I don't think in language? what if I think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how I think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. I suppose I should say that I've never met a psych major that I liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, I suppose I am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, I have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. I will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, English major. I have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. I suppose I should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell I want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. I guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer. ",0
"Well, today is my second day as a freshmen at UT. My fist class was at 9:30 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High School, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today. Many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. In fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where I just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the UT Business School. Already I've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. That makes me feel so proud and honored for the position I am in. Other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. Again, I realize how lucky I am. I can't see myself majoring in anything else besides Business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. Psychology was my second choice for a major. I was that close to being a psychology major. So, now I know it was meant to be. I've had an accounting internship already, and I 'v e been to numerous business programs, which I have enjoyed very much. It brings me so much joy to say that I just may have found my niche because I know that this major includes all things that I enjoy. ",1
"It is just past one a. m. and I feel like doing this now. I'm not really tired and know that I should go to bed because I have to go to class at eight tomorrow. I've done all of my homework and am extremely bored. I just got off the internet with my boyfriend back at home, which would be Conroe. He's lonley just like me and we have been talking for about three hours. I miss him a lot and don't quite know what to do. I really don't have a lot of friends here. I had seven best friends that I grew up with since around fourth grade and all seven of them went to A&M. I really feel left out. They all e-mail me and tell me what a great time they are having and I wish I were with them. I've wanted to come here since I was in fifth grade though, so this is a dream come true for me. I just wish I had someone to talk to. They were always there for me and we always had a great time. I also miss my family, which is probably to be expected in the first weeks of college. My brother called me today, he is 13, and told me that he just got a new dwarf hamster and I know he got it just because I told him last week that they were the cutest things. He takes everything I say to heart, even if he dosen't know it. My mom's and my brother's birthday is in a week and I'm not sure if I can get home. I wasen't able to bring my car up here so I'm stuck at the mercy of my roommate. I just want to be there for their birthday's. If my roommate dosen't go home though then I'm stuck up here. I've known Sara for quite a long time. For about eight years. We've never really been best friends or anything but we decided to room together because we knew we could trust each other. She is pretty neat, although she does complain a lot. I have really nothing against here though. I'm kinda hungry, if you would like to know that. Instead of eating dinner I went down the hall and watched the MTV music awards and ate candy and popcorn and I'm still hungry. I don't want to have to get up in the morning. When I scheduled my classes I should not have put four classes in one day, but I had no choice. I'm really regretting it now though. Homework is hard to do if it all has to be done on the same day. I'm also taking an aerobics class and it is quite fun. I never expected it to be so physical though. I know you are supposed to exercise and all, it's just that it hurts. I am so out of shape and it just makes me aware of that fact. My eyes are getting all fuzzy. And it is very cold. I'm getting tired now and I think it is because of all the blue writing on the white background. I wasen't tired before. So, my twenty minutes is almost up and I might go to bed now. I doubt it, I am a night person. I'd rather stay up all night and sleep all day. That would be great. Well, I'll talk to you in the next writing assignment. ",1

"I do have spells of concentration where I can get things accomplished, and I guess getting around to doing this assignment is one of them. I don't know what happened to me in the past couple years of my life. I grew up as a bad girl--always in the corner in elementary school, only girl in my crowd to be suspended, first girl to try """"new things. """"  But in the middle of my sophomore year in high school I came into contact with a few people who made me WANT to change my lifestyle. I lived in the Dubai, United Arab Emirates from 7th grade until the middle of my junior year. I went to a small, elite private school, The American School of Dubai, where I was known by teachers and parents (and everyone knew everyone in our community)as strange and, therefore bad. My attitude was """"screw them"""" because I was angry at the world and dissatisfied with society. mind you if you really know me you find I am generally a good-natured person who looks for the best in people if they have anything to offer. And this is what my sophomore English teacher did. she was an amazing women, beyond intelligent, down to earth, somewhat of a cynic, hilarious, but very tough. a lot of students hated her at first but eventually realized she was doing it for your own good. But if you acted stupid she treated you like you were. But she treated me with respect straight off and I was slightly stunned. it sounds cheesy but she made me want to work to prove to people I had """"what it takes"""". I was always told I had potential and I knew I did. she made me see my strong points of analyzing literature and writing and from then on I wanted to do well in school. by no means did I become a bookworm. I had fun but also made straight A's in all honor/AP classes and I realized how easily it came to me and I was content. two years later, a year and a half after I moved back to the States, I actually got to see the recommendation she wrote for my college applications, although I wasn't supposed to. I think I cried. it was the first time someone who took me seriously enough to write and let people know that I was one of the few people who had actually touched HER life. god knows she touched mine. now I know what I have to offer even if other people don't. but lately things have become overwhelming and I feel like my hold on my life is slipping. I just hope I do decently in university. I know I can if I try but I feel no motivation. I have no energy to kick my brain in gear. and it makes me sick. but I do have hope and deep down I know I can get over it. I realize I have hit a rather shallow, false part of life and I hope my interest in learning will give me a fat kick in the rear. ",0
"I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend Derek is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don't want him to think I don't care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named Jordan who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as """"college doesn't change me. """" He is a TA at OU and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in Mexico together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn't mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game. ",0
     I'm really happy I started my workouts today even though I feel awful right now. I need to get back in the shape I was before the marathon. I don't really feel like going out tonight at all but I have to go because I promised my friends. I'm not really big into parties I think they are sort of stupid I'm always really uncomfortable because I don't really know that many people except the guys they go with and I feel really weird just following them around. oh well it doesn't really matter I guess everyone there is drunk anyways I really want to go home this weekend and see zach I really miss him a lot I wish we could have both gone to the same school but we Couldn't. thanksgiving is really far away and I don't know if I can wait that long to see him. We have been friends so long it feels really weird not seeing him everyday there are some good things about being here I never have to see ross or trevor I hate those guys. I would like to lie and say they taught me something about myself balhaablaha but zach was right I never needed either or them. Dating zach is so weird but being friends first makes it more special. I really miss sharon I can't believe she is going into the army in two days israel is so far away and I can't believe I won't see her for two more years. kayla is at texas state with nathan and says she loves it I hope her and blake get back together she just loves him so much I feel bad that she's sad about them breaking up with him and I don't really know what to tell her. I miss the basketball team so much I have pat and kellan here with me but zach and maury and matt and nathan and dotun are so far away I hate it I guess maury and zach aren't that far away dallas isn't that bad. Its sad though I won't be able to go back and see ben and dipot and my brother play since my parents moved I'm sad I won't be able to go to reno with zach anymore but I guess he decided to stay home iwht me for christmas so Andrew and dotun will go by themselves without us christmas is going to be so fun with him I know zach feels like he will never mean as much to me as ross but I feel the same way about amy I think we both know what we have is different but I really don't like talkinga bout it with him I would rather just ahave fun together like we always do we know what we are to each other and I don't think we need to keep talking about it. I'm over ross for good this time same with trevor and no matter how many times they ask me I won't get back together with them I don't think zach believes me though I don't konw what I can do to make him no so insecure about us I don't know whatever hell figure it out eventually. Its hard to talk to him though I could never hurt him though I just know him to well everything about him we grew up together so I know all the things that hurt him and he knows all the things that hurt me so I don't know if I could ever accidentally hurt him or say anything that would make him sad because I know exactly what those things are. He knows those things about me too I think its better this way to know everything all the wounds a person has  when you are with tthem there ar eno secrets between us because he was the person I always told me secrets to and he is still that person I go to so I don't understand why he thinks I will break up with him inever will he will have to break up with me because I refuse to hurt him I would never cheat on him eitheri love him too much and I respect him too much I think it is just awful when people cheat on each other I don't think its the worst thing you can do but it is still terrible you should care enough about the person to end it before you deliberatly hurt them that is just mean and selfish I don't think I could ever do that to anyone but especially to zach god I've tlaked about him way to much I think but who care nobody will probably ever read this I miss him a lot I think its weird what happened alst weekend going up to visit him will be awesome in two weeks I can't wait I miss him so much he is really starting to look like ben I  ,0

I'm also excited that my best bud justin gets to go with us I met him at church camp my freshman year of high school. he's not from kerrville he's from boerne but after that first year we were always kicking it together every weekend. we have had some fun times parties, going wakeboarding at the lake, snow skiing, spring break at south padre. its all good. well back to hunting now, its a good drive and here I am stuck doing my homework instead of driving in the car, I wish I had a lap top then I could do this while I was driving. I almost got one, but my dad changed his mind and got me the box. I'm not complaining because I have a burner and did and its real fast and all but a lap top just seems more versatile. dang how long is twenty minutes. when your sleeping twenty minutes goes by SO FAST but when your doing homework or sitting in some boring class, IT TAKES FOREVER. funny how that works. any way I wish the twenty minutes was over and it almost is just a few more minutes left. at least this was an easy assignment, not some hardcore 235346 page essay you wanted typed out single spaced font size of 9. I have to do one of those for English and I haven't even thought about. I'm a procrastinator it will probably be the night before and I hadn't even started on it, oh man I just got a big time hunger for ice cream, chocolate ice cream that is. after this maybe ill go get some, I hope you don't take off for grammar or are expecting proper English in this thought page. because I'm just writing what comes to me and my thoughts move faster than I write so its kind of hard because I have so many thoughts yet my hands can only go so fast. dang there are a lot of hot chicks at UT I'm glad that me and the girl I was dating from home decided to date other people before we went away to school, because I would be a bad boy and want to mess around on her, but I'm not like that, I have real guilty conscience. any way back to those hot chick, dang so many girls and only 4 years of college to get to know them all. I hope I can fit them all in to my busy schedule, you right like they would give me the time of day well actually a real hot chick asked me the time but that's about all she would give me dang like I said twenty minutes is a long time and the clock is going very slowly I swear it hasn't moved since I started. now I'm thinking about """"what's going through my mind what can I type to take up space maybe I should just start typing long words but then I wouldn't spell them right so its no use. any way back to school and back to this 20 minute writing assignment. I don't know what to right, I'm drawing a blank, dang its like my mind is running black. well now I'm worried about not having enough crap packed. I can't wait to go to new mexico, its my favorite trip of the year, its all I can think about right now because I'm leaving right after I finish this. only a few more minutes. I'm going home and I can't wait to see my dog. of all the people at my house to miss, I can't wait to see my dog, he probably doesn't care but oh well, I can't wait to see him. ",1
"     My sandwich tastes really good!  The pickle in it is a little too zesty, though. I don't think I'll buy those from HEB anymore. I wish I had more time to watch TV. I really miss Big Brother 3, but I really can't find enough hours in the day. It makes me sad :(  I have a latin quiz on Friday, I don't know how well I'm going to do. I have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so I think I'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. That's the hard part!  The paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. I get them confused sometimes. I'm upset that I went to College Station this weekend and missed church. I really wanted to go this Sunday, but instead I went to Mass with my friend at College Station. I had fun in CS, and I definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but I would have rather been back for the service. Oh well, I can go on Sunday. I start my job tomorrow!!  I'm kind of nervous about that. I've never had a job before. What if I really screw up??  And what if I'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time?  On Tuesday and Thursday, I'll have no problem, but what about Friday?  I work from 9-1, and I have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. I wish I would have just told her that I'd like to go into work an hour earlier on Thursday and then I could get out of work an hour earlier on Friday morning. That would have been perfect. But oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . I took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!!  I didn't think I'd ever finish it. I've only been typing for 6 minutes!!  14 more to go, lol. Does anyone actually read these things?  Like, is it ok if I stop typing for a couple of seconds to take a bit of my sandwich?  I think I'm going to, hold on. . YUMMY!!  It's good, but those darn pickles. . Oh well. what exactly are we supposed to talk about. What we see?  Or feel? or smell? or whatever. Well, I'll tell you what I see. . WAIT!  No, I'll describe my side of the room for you: on my closet door I have a movie poster of Ben Stiller's movie   Zoolander  . It has a great big, lime green Z on it and has Zoolander written at tht bottom in purple letters. It also has Ben Stiller sitting kind of funny (I'm not sure how to explain it) in front of the Z. At the top it says 3% Body fat, 1% brain activity. I've never seen Zoolander, have you?  I just liked the poster because I thought it was funny. Beside it, I have a movie poster of Orange County. It has Colin Hanks on it with oranges for eyes, and Jack Black has an orange in his mouth. Jack Black is gross. . all he did the whole movie was run around in his underwear. 10 minutes up!  Halfway done. Ok, back to my posters. The next poster I have is of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, my favorite movie ever. She's wearing the black dress that she wears at the beginning when she's looking at Tiffany's in the morning. Remember that dress?  She also has one of those looooong cigarette things, I'm not sure what it's called. *sigh* every girl should watch Breakfast at Tiffany's. It's the best. Another poster I have is of Rat Race. Everyone on the poster has big heads and little bodies. On the poster there's: I think his name is Breckin Meyer, he was on Clueless, too. There's also Amy Smart, Seth Green, Whoopie Goldber, some guy who's name I don't know and can't relate another movie to him, Cuba Gooding, Jr. , Jon Lovitz, and the guy who keeps falling asleep throughout the movie. He's my favorite.   I'm win-ning!    It's so funny!  Ok, I also have an Ocean's Eleven poster. It's read with white writing on it. In the front are the hotties George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, and in the back kind of faded out are the rest of their little helpers from the movie. Beneath the title of the poster (Ocean's Eleven, hehe) It says   They're having so much fun it's illegal.   I think this is my favorite poster in my whole room. I also have a Spy Game poster on it. The only person on it is Robert Redford, and it says   It's not how you play the game. it's how the game plays you.   Very cool. What else?  Oh!  I also have a little picture, that is once again from Breakfast at Tiffany's. It has both Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard looking in the window at Tiffany's. She's wearing the same dress that she's wearing in my big poster and George is wearing a coat and pants, with a skinny tie. He has his hands in his pocket and is laughing abut something silly that Holly Golightly has said. At least, that is what I assume. I have been typing for 16 minutes and 50 seconds so that leaves me about 3 minutes left. Hmmm. . what else can be said. I have to save some describing for later, I don't want to give it all away in this first time. What will I talk about next time?  Are there ever going to be subjects for you to talk about, or will it always be like a mad journal thing?  I understand this mad journal thing, though, because what if you gave me a subject that I didn't really have much to say about. What would I say then??  So, I guess this is good, just mad journaling. . I'll think about what to say more next time, so I'll be a little more prepared and won't bore you out of your mind. 18 min. 48 seconds. . 1minute and some odd seconds left. 19 min!! woo-hoo. ok one more minute. What about this war GWB wants to have with Iraq??  Is he nuts!  That'll be 2 wars (or at least fights) that we've had while he was president. How sad. 20 seconds left. what to say, what to say. . 10 seconds. Well, I'll start my good=byes now. Goodbye!! ",1
"Wow, here is Friday night and I'm doing my psychology assignment that was supposed to be due yesterday. I remember setting all of these personal goals for my four glorious years at college, and here I am in week three coming to the not so surprising realization that these goals were totally unrealistic to begin with. Why do people even set goals?  Goals lead to expectations, expectations lead to disappointments. Guatama, one of my personal inspirations founded the great religion of Buddhism. He came up with the not so clever theory that those who desire nothing are never disappointed with life. I think most of us had that one figured out in Kindergarten or perhaps I was just exceptionally bright. As humans we set goals because we find ourselves having nothing to do, and because we fail to accept the fact that we have absolutely no control over our future, which makes man totally uncomfortable. Our technological advancements were not necessarily for the good of humanity but instead to compensate for our innate fear of nature. It's ironic because most Americans have adopted the religion of Christianity, and according to Christianity God created earth and all of its creatures, yet we put absolutely no faith in nature and certainly not in mankind. We're supposed to believe in that which we can not see and yet we can't even trust what it is we do see. Man is full of hypocrisy in every aspect of life. Some are better than others but in the end we're all hippocrites. More specifically, Christians in general are very interesting group to observe. Every Sunday people enter a building to worhip and praise God. They may sit in a pew for an hour but does this hour really change anyone's life?  Most people struggle simply to stay awake, to walk away getting something out of the sermon is just too much to ask. Sadly enough most people think that because their religion is the """"chosen"""" one that this hour makes them better than those who choose to sit at home and watch Meet the Press. As much fun as this tangent I've been getting on really has been my twenty minutes are more than up. So we'll just continue this . what is this they say. next session. ",0
"I love just being me. Honestly without my personality, I am nothing in this world. There are so many people alive today that without my individuality, I could not survive. It would be too weird if I walked around the streets seeing a splitting image of myself. Hehe I think that I would probably pass out if that ever happened to me. Ouch, my arm really itches right now. Man I hate when I scratch so hard and it leaves marks on my skin. It's so unattractive and it is so annoying when I have to shave over it. I really can't believe that he would say that to her. Doesn't he realize that some things are best left unsaid especially when you don't know the whole story? Fainting has to be one of the most unique experiences that I have ever gone through. It's so weird that you lose all control of yourself for that onesecond. Thank goodness that girl was there to help me even though she didn't know me. I would freak out if I ever came in contact with someone who was about to pass out and fell on me. Man Jessica really can draw. I wish that I had the talent to do something like drawing my selfportrait. My legs are really starting to bother me since they are in that position. Oh man I need to go read my Theater since I have that class tomorrow. What should I wear tomorrow? I wonder if it is going to be as hot as it has been this whole time. I thought it would feel so much better than McAllen. For goodness sakes, at least McAllen has wind. Man what I would give to be at the beach right now without a care in the world sipping on the best tasting glass of lemonade and laying out getting the greatest tan in the world. And the POboys at Blackbeard's. No one makes greater Fantail Special than they do. I really hope my computer comes soon. I can't wait to start adding songs to my computer. Why hasn't my phone rang in a while? I need to call Jessie in a minute. I wonder if I have anything that I need to get done tomorrow. Hopefully my backpack will work out good. Because it was so cheap compared to everything else that was there. I love my shoes and I can't believe that my black ones broke. That was too weird that it happened especially since it was in the middle of the street and I wasn't doing anything that would have made it break normally. I hope my computer is the one I wanted. I wonder who is calling right now? Must be for Amber since she is talking to that person right now. I really feel like watching Hope Floats right now. That is such a great movie, and the guy in it is so hot. ",1
"It's Sunday and I need to go to church since I didn't go this morning because I woke up at 11:15 and church is at 11:30. So I already took a shower and I'm dressed to go at 8:00 p. m. Right now it's 7:25 and I wish it was about 4 because it seems like the day has just went by and I haven't done very much. That's alright though because I'm listening to my favorite rap music. Trick Daddy Dollars, Ja Rule, DMX, Ice Cube, Hot Boys, Juvenile, Black & Dangerous, K-ROC, Too Short, Twista, and JT Money they seem to make me feel better. Even if I'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. Earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. She got mad because I was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where I was at. So I had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. I was mad also because I gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. So we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that I didn't approve of. So I was instantly angered because I have a short temper to begin with. It was a big deal really but I don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. So we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. She decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. I acted like I didn't care so we just ended it there. This worries me because I hate to end it like that but I'm so hardheaded that I won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. It also hard because I'm here and she's 355 miles away and I can't see her the way I use to. I guess I'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what I'm use to. The girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people I've never seen so many people in one place at one time. Being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that I'm not used to. Hopefully I'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. I don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. Whatever happens I'll just try to do my best and do the best I can as things come along. ",0
"I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in Austin, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, TX? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is Austin, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 4. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 20 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. ",0
"     Today is a very stressful day, I just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when I don't understand something perfectly I get really frusterated. My boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. Why can't he just let me do what I want? I'm kind of homesick lately. People know all their friends from high school and I'm just alone from Wisconsin, besides Shane who is not being very nice lately. Well actually it's me not being very nice. It's really weird because my friends and I all have birthdays this week. Mine's on September 11th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. It never really is. Two years ago my party got crashed by Richard and then last year it was 9-11. Hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 9-11. I think it will. The fact that I have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. Oh well I think I've officially decided that I'm changing my birthday to september 12th. My friends and I are all going to Hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. I called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought I was going to drop out of school. They wanted to make sure that I had been studying. they don't realize that I am on my own now and that I can deal with my own problems myself. Janelle and I just found this new diet. You eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. You have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because I'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. Thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. I palyed on a soccer team today. Our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. It was a good workout because it was so hot out. It was alot of fun, I scored three goals and I broke Darius' toe. OOPs! I feel kind of bad. I hate the fact that the last 2 weeks all I've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. Now I realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. I also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good GPA. I set goqals for myself today because I was reading a book at   Barnes and Noble and I said that I was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. Hopefully I can do that. I think I will be able to. I can't believe that Shane hasn't called yet. I either thought he'd call at 10am or not at all. Oh well there's more out there. I am having a lot of fun here though, so I don't really care if we break up.   ",0
"I'm still trying to figure out why I always procrastinate. I think I like to work under pressure, I have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. I wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. I hope the second because I have never been one to study, and I would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? I thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, I can already tell I'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, I already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life I want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. I'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. I'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. I read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was Satan or the grim reaper or something like that. I think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. I hope bush wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, I am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. I just believe bush will do a lot better job than Kerry, and the whole Vietnam thing I just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while I don't know everything about it, I was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people I heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. I just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. I wish I could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. I wish I could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but I don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but I don't really know what happened there, I guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. I realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because I am thinking about how long it is, or I'm not doing an activity I find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun, I'm surprised I woke up for it. I missed class the other day when I slept through it and it was at 12. that's just strange, getting up at the 8 one, but oversleeping the 12. I wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor I met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which I would agree with although I haven't experienced life after school, but I think it will be hell.

"Hey you, So far so good, I've got Chem done and don't have to worry about this when I finish typing. wish I could type faster, without the errors too, that'd be great. Like Tony the tiger. Anyways, I'm happy as of the moment. I get to see Anthony today, and any day that that happens is a good day for me. (At least, most of the time)  =)   I like rings, that was the only thing I could think of. Sometimes when I write, (normally I write letters/notes to people) in this """"stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell) type of writing. But sometimes I try to be random and that just isn't fair to anyone. I  don't like this delete button, (I just don't like the fact I have to use it so much) anyways. I've been waking up on time so far. What has it been, 5 days? dear me, I'll never keep it up, being such not a morning person and all. But maybe I'll adjust, or not. I want internet access in my room, I don't' have it yet, but I will on Wed??? I think. But that ain't soon enough, cause I got calculus homework due by then, and I hate using the library computers or Jackie's. She's such a good friend, what would I ever do without her? no one knows. not even me, or you, whoever you are. Sorry I'm not interesting today, must have picked a bad day. The phrase """"academics first"""" just seems to be such a lie. Cause everywhere you go, it seems that """"athletics is first"""" or at least that's how it is in high school. Where you're AP physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 1 class every week, (and you only have 2 or 3 classes a week to begin with) anyways. it's a pet peeve of mine. What others do I have? I'm not sure at the moment, I'm not sure about a lot of things though. Anthony is always saying """"you don't' know a lot do you?"""" and it's true, cause when I don't' know, I don't know, and I admit it. I wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday. I always wanted to see if I could beat one. But I can't lie very well to begin with. Can't lie to Mom, Jackie, and Anthony. but everyone else I can pass a few things by. By the way, (there's is nothing to add on to that, it was just what I thought) That's what you get when you assign this type of assignment. but I'm not complaining, I really enjoy it. it lets me think. cause when I think in my head, it doesn't' really work, I still don't know what I'm thinking. but when I write it, then I can at least see what I'm trying to think. My finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing. I must sound like a hick when I talk/type. but that's okay, cause I'm Texan and if that's what it takes to be Texan, then so be it. Damn don't' I sound spiffy. (not really) don't' know why people (Anthony) hates Texas so much. I mean, common on! It don't ever get cold. That's the best part. (well it does sometimes, but not as much as other places)  Finish. I type what I read, and then go from there. Can you find the """"finish button"""". Oh, yesterday I had the overbearing urge to watch the """"fox and the hound"""". Why? I don't' know. Don't' care to much either. """"Hi I'm Copper!. I'm Todd. """" One D or two. I don't' know. Don't' think I care too much either about that. What do I care about? Can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there is something. Anthony, grades. (Anthony's my Boy friend by the way) Look, there's that phrase, """"by the way' again. BTW. Blah. that always reminds me of Jackie, (my friend, happy PR chick) """"Blah"""" does. She says it a lot, and now I'm saying it a little more. Hmmm. 2 mins!   The brisket will be ready in 1 hour!. sorry that commercial always pops up in my head when I start counting down. Down the hill, over the hill. Where's grandmother? Who knows? I guess I Don't. Do you? Good question. bye for now, farewell. Godspeed. Choa! Bye. ~ME. Oh I didn't know that we could keep going after the ending. I was all prepared to stop and all. Well I'd keep writing, but I'm sure I have stuff to do, and this ain't ever going to be read anyways. so adios amigos!. ~ME Man, I type slow.  ",1

I've finally made it here! you know, I had always thought that once I got to college, the stressful life I once knew back in my home town of Conroe would no longer exist. well, I was so terribly wrong! however, though I am completely busy every second of every day, it's been a blast! yesterday for example: I woke up bright and early at 6:30, had class from 910 and 1011, came back to my beautifully decorated dorm in Jester west and tried for like an hour to get to this page which I later found out was down at the time, then, briskly ran to my philosophy class which lasted from 12, after which I tanned, went back home again to brush my teeth and wash my face before my psy. class (yours!) from 3305. once class was over, my friend johnna and I proceeded to take the long hike back to jester in the rain! (yay!) there, I ate my first meal of the day pot roast! mmmmm. next, I had to walk all the way over to my parking spot on trinity where because I needed to get some clothes my dad brought down for my some time last week that have just been sitting in the trunk of my car getting all wrinkled and nasty. rather than walk back with two armfulls of clothes, I decided to drive back. after the laundry was hanging safely in my tiny closet, I took it upon myself to fight the 630 Austin traffic over to my grandparents house off of Lamar where I was instructed all week by my mother to take my car so it could get a new inspection sticker. while in traffic, I happened to notice that my sticker would not be out of date until November! this was particularly angering to me because tonight from 912 or so, I was to attend a mixer with my pledge sisters and the pledge members of sigma ki and instead of having just a few moments to myself before I had to take another shower and proceed to get ready, I was cooling my heels in a traffic jam for a car inspection sticker that wasn't necessary at the time. however, once at the grandparents house, I did stock up on some much needed food and beverage products. now, I am finally back and I have all of 10 minutes to sit on my floor, watch a little tv and eat some Reesesmini cup. after that, I quickly got ready for the nights planned activity. the party actually turned out to be pretty fun except for the fact the Austin police made two appearances! luckily, neither me or any of my sisters had formal charges brought against them. ok enough of that. only about 6 minutes left and I still have so much to say! let's talk about the future I want to live in a loft apartment in new York city with huge, towering white walls, bay windows, and blackandwhite checkered tile in the kitchen. I hopefully will be an established poet. also, I would like to have a successful career as a professional buyer. now, this job would be just too great for me all day long, I would be able to shop! my clientele would range from movie stars to the rich who haven't the time, or fashion sense, to dress and style themselves. ah! my time here is up! thank you and I hope you have enjoyed the show:)and remember kids: carpe' diem!

"This comp science lab is pretty nice and I'm kind of confused about what to say or do here. I mean I've been thinking about all this stuff lately and now that I come to write stuff down nothing really comes to mind except filler, you know, the kind of random thoughts you think that don't really mean much at all, I mean look at this thing I'm typing right now!  I didn't make the band but that's ok I guess more time for Geology 401 and Matt isn't in it either so its all good. I want to go swing dancing tonight but Jeff isn't there (well and Rob's line is busy so its kind of bunk) cause I take the bus, but it doesn't run as late as I'll be out.  Anyway. Um well lets see I guess I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm like thinking and stuff. Actually I'm wondering if anyone will ever read this, so I'm somewhat apprehensive: I've been thinking some pretty damn personal stuff lately so I don't really want to broadcast on the World Wide freaking Web. I also just typed a profanity and replaced it with a euphemism. I guess that's in case someone actually reads this too. Cara. Hehehe that was cryptic, wasn't it??  See I'm kind of giving a vague notion here. I just type what I think. So there you have it. Wow Five minutes and my wrist feels funny. the FAC Typing things. keyboards, I mean. they aren't very ergonomic if you know what I mean and the surface of the desk kind of hurts. Replace Keyboard. Well it looks like Matt is getting into this assignment, too. which is really kind of cool when I think about it. It will be interesting to me to actually go back and read the thing, cause I'm always editing what I write but now I'm just kind of going forward. relax. I don't know let me see well I'm kind of hungry, isn't that like part of the Id?  I always heard about that-- you know, along with Superego and stuff hey check it out I just read the instructions while I was typing that line and I didn't even miss any keys. Not bad eh?  This is kind of odd for me in another way, too  because I'm a Linguistics Major and well see I know most of the stuff they teach in 306 already, but the Professor seems cool enough. No more high school. Ten minutes to go. Living at home is ok. I can take the metro bus. Matt is cracking up. If you read his (That's """"Kay, Matthew"""") you probably shouldn't count it as much cause I can hear him stop typing to re-read what he already wrote and that's not ver continuous, now is it?  I hope I have enough money for food this week. $20 has to last me. I hat this space bar it sucks a lot. You have to hit it real no really hard just to make it go. see what I mean??  I hate it when people use adjectives instead of the proper adverbs. How hard is it to put on a little anyway?    My generation doesn't care, I guess. She's so smart. In fact she went to Duke when she was a Junior in High School. Damn it I get mad just picturing her somewhere else having fun with someone else. But its cool I don't have to worry. or so I say. how could someone so Awesome be alone for long?   No no no. I only see her once a week. It will never work. Okay. well no I'm better. I didn't mean to go all mushy, in fact I'm thinking about going back and deleting that stuff. you know, in the name of science and all. Isn't that weird how I use the second person?  As if I actually expect it to enhance readability or something!  I guess I'm trying to make this whole thing like a VERY one sided conversation. Click click goes the happy little keyboard. My fedora is on the table. I learned the other day that its a Bush Hat from Australia and not really a fedora but its all good because I still think it looks good. People think I'm funny wearing a fedora all the time, but I don't care. They can just piss off. I get lots of Indiana Jones jokes. Loss. I'm at a loss here. Ever since that paragraph where I talked about her it got all funky and now its happening again. No. I have a striped shirt on that's white and burnt orange but nobody said anything. I guess that's ok but I thought it was really nifty. 20 minutes seems like a long time at first but then I guess when you get to the end of it its not really  WELL DAMN Matt is looking at my screen, that bastard. I had to stop typing for a sec to make him look away. I guess he didn't see anything deeply embarrassing. rrHahahah  Well times up. I want my cookie. ",0
"As I sat down to start typing, my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment. A lot of times, I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings. To be perfectly honest, I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like, all the good times, all the bad times, the lessons I've learned and through which ways I learned them. I must say I am definitely a thinker, and someone who dwells on the past. Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time. I really miss my ex-boyfriend, who was also at one time my best friend. It's like I am missing a huge piece in my life. I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time, thinking what if, and if only I had done this differently. The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently, I guess the feelings just weren't there anymore and the basis of our at one time � great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us. Yay, my favorite television show is on, well one of them anyways, 7th Heaven!  From watching that show, I become relaxed and more open-minded. The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts, very useful in life and this day in time. I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much. However, watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but I know if I eat, I will get sick to my stomach. Eating is a major thing to me, partly because I am very self-conscious about my weight. Up until I got into high school, I never worried a whole lot about what I looked like or weighed, but freshman year hit me and I became paranoid. I saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting Caught doing what I had been doing. Of course my parents were disappointed, but they didn't get mad at me, they were just worried. I saw a psychiatrist, a counselor and a Dietician. The psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field, but my counselor, she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth. In fact, it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist; however, she does not know that. I would really like to one day become a child psychologist. I have always been interested in helping children. Hmm, I do believe the chicken nuggets I am fixing in the oven smell so good. I cannot wait for this weekend to come; I am going back home to see some friends and I think my friend Adam and I are going to a football game Friday night, and then Saturday night, I get to race, which I am pretty excited about. We didn't get to race last weekend because it got rained out, which sucked, but I got to hang with my friend later that night, so it was okay. Wow, I just realized that I went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend/best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun I had from the previous weekend, and I just remembered about my hand. There is something wrong with it and I'm not sure what it is, but it hurts. I have a bump on it and every time I move my wrist downward, something pops over it to the left and when I bring my wrist back up, that thing pops back over to the right. It is really gross and hurts, but luckily, Friday, when I go back home I am going to the doctor to get it checked out. It's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you don't even realize it. Wow, its been over twenty minutes already and it doesn't seem like I have typed very much.  ",0
"I just always feel like I am better off when I get things done. I have found that I have been procrastinating a lot lately and I just want to get things back into order so I can do more fun things. I was happy about passing by the UT tennis club booth on my way back from class, I am hoping to have time to do that. I really wish I talked to the UT tennis coach abt playing on the team but ihope the players in this club are competetive and have fun personalities at the same time. not only do I like tennis, but I am happy bec it will give me a workout. I don't have much time to go to the gym  now and I really want to work out more often. I picked up an aerobics schedule today so maybe I will have time for some classes. but all of this reading and studying I have to do takes up more time than expected, I just feel like I don't have enough hours in my day to accomplish all of my goals. tonight I had a sorority meeting to go to which was so boring and I just wanted to leave so I could do more imprt things with my time. but I know in the long run this sorority thing will pay off bec I will get to meet a lot of people and it is an easier way to make friends whenyou already have this sort of group formed and you just have to actually meet the people already selected. ok, that was a really long and complicated sentence. another worry that is on my mind is regarding that experimental thing we have the option of doing. when I went to sign up today, all of the experiments were full so now I am worried I wont get a spot in a study and I will have to do the research paper. not that that is terrible, but iw ould just prefer not writing the paper, especially since I already took my time to fill out the pre testing form last night. whatever. I will have to just get used to everything and all the new changes, since I am a freshman and everything. when that happens, then I will be better able to organize my time and not stress so much. speaking of stress, I should have signed up for that reducing stress freshman seminar, it would have been really helpful abt now. actually, all the seminars were full by the time I got to register, since I was at the last orientation session - terrible mistake. I should have come to an earlier one but I didn't decide to come to school here until it was too late to get into the earlier sessions. so I had to go to the later one, oh well. at least I got classes that are required, I can't get everything I suppose. going to the university of florida was my other option but everyone I know, from  my high school and every other part of florida, goes there and I kind of wanted to get away from everything. even though I do miss pewople a lot, I think I am better of here. and, the good business school was a main consideration. since I was accepted, I felt like it was a good opportunity and I shouldn't give it up. everyone always asks me why I came all the way from miami, florida to texas and I always say bec of th ebusiness school. and that's true and all but ir eally like other thinga abrt it too. I was just admiring today the fountains - I love the nvironment. except for the people hanging around on guadeloupe that I have to pass by on my way back to the castilian everyday - where I live. those people scare me, and I know I have nothing to be scared of I just don't like seeing them there. anyway, I am looking at a picture of me and my mother now and thinking about how my parents are leaving on a trip to europe tomorrow morning - that will be fun. I hope they have a great trip an safe. I am always worried abt them, I just don't want anything to happen to them. I know my mom is scared of flying and I just hope everything is ok for them. they have wanted to go to france and england for a long time. actuakly, they wanted to got o italy too - they were all jealous that I got ot go there with my friends a couple of spring breaks ago. whenever I think abt that trip I think abt how I wrote abt it - the uffizi museum to be more specific - in my application to the university of virginia. even knowing that you souldnt write abt trips I still did it, I guess I thought they wouldnt care if I did it. that's funny. I guess I am still bitter I didn't get into there, it was my top choice of schools. but I am happy at UT. I hope it doesn't get as cold as it sometimes does. anything below 50 is terrible for me, coming from miami and all where the temperature stays on an average of 80 - I love it. speaking of which, playing tennis all the time int hat heat was not too much fun, but it was loads of fun. I miss my tennis coach, she sent me a present here but I havent gotten it yet, I should call her. but I havent talked to her inso long I think it would be weird to call her, oh well. maybe I will one day, I guess I should to say thank you when the present comes. or I could send  a card, whatever. I will decide later, if it ever gets here!! well, 20  minutes is up and I would like to write more but, like I said before, so much to do and so little time. I still ahve to read a million and two pages and I only have 2 classes tomorrow. I just want to get te next days reading out of the way so idont have to thinka bt craming it all in tomorrow night. this was fun! ",1
"Well I have to say I'm alittle nervous about this assignment. Writing for twenty minutes continously will be a challenge sine I don't think I can even sit in the say seat for twenty min. but anyways. Michelle I hope this is sufficient, and I'm sorry that you have to look over all of these. THat's quite a task. I'm in the computer lab and there is a guy using a typewriter . I think that's kind of odd. but whatever. THen there is a girl next to me who could probably type 1000 words a minute and I'm over here using my index fingers. Anyway I don't really know where to begin Maybe I'll talk about the use this exersze would be to a psychologist. I bet you can tell a lot form one of these. People are probably honest and least once they get going. And honesty is hard to find these days. We are all actors on the stage of life. """"  I take this to mean, to our outside world we put on plays. We are afraid of truely being ourselves {whatever that means} and we end up conforming into a type of behavior that is acceptable to our society. I know If everyone followed this belief, then we would all be the same. But good thing about it, is we all have different wviews of what society is,  And we have diiferent feelings toward that society. Such as rebellion, isolation, acceptance, contentiveness, that's not a word is it. but you know what I mean. I do know this isn't crazy the way things work, how well basically the same but we can be so different. It's very humbling to me. To be just another face in the crowd but there is so much there twhen you look at it. Sometimes I like to look at life{my reality} as a fractal. If you don't know a fractal is geometric chaos. It has an infinite amount of surface area, so If you look at one point, it turns into another point, and so on and so on. THat's what I think the human brain is like. You have human race as a species, then country, then state, then county, then town, then extended family, then nuclear family, then the mind itself, and in comparison to the rest of theat one hasn;t gone anywhere. THere is so much learn.  ",1
"It is quiet in my room, Josh is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at Sam's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 8 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 6 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of Texas but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . .

"Well, here I am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. I do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as I do. Lack of sleep, maybe. Laziness, probably. I consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects I always put it off until the last minute. I just got home tonight, its past midnight, and I am tired. I really want to go to sleep so I am not dead during classes tomorrow. I am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. This is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. Pretty much all my classes are going well, but I am not sure how I am going to study for exams. However, I think that if I keep up my study habits that got me here, I will do just fine. I am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and I do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. My eating habits worry me too now. Three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all I go for. My head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. I really love music. No matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. I enjoy all different kinds, and I have listen to a variety since I have started writing. It is quite weird now that I think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. I have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that I truly love. The whole college experience has been great so far. I love the campus, the professors, and the people. Most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. I almost look forward to each new school day now that I'm at the University. Being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that I wish I was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything. ",1
"Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 4 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 1200 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA101, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 3 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in Washington, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 20 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 20 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $60 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 3 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to UT's next football game. The one against North Texas was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when Frank from Survivor Africa is seen in San Francisco, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 15 seconds left. . 5 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. ",0
"I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, Australia was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. ",0
"I am a bit in wonderous as to what is supposed to be accomplished by this writing assignment and what it is supposed to prove. I hope this isn't some wierd psychoanalysis of who I am or something like that. Not that I am an X-files junkie and I think this is one big conspiracy or anything though. That is not one of the best shows about conspiracies anyway. I really enjoyed """"Conspiracy Theory""""  with mel Gibson and Julia Roberts though. Right now I am thinking that I could be doing other homework that is a little bit more consequential for my classes tomorrow and just start typing random letters with little regard to this assignment, but I am an honest and will continue to do this assignment as if someone were really going to read it. I am really excited about the Astros victory tonight over the Phillies, because it put us 3 games ahead of the reds who split their double header today. If the Astros end up in the playoffs I plan on making at least one trip to Houston to watch them play in the Astrodome. Especially since that will probably be the last time I will khave a chance to see a game played in the Astrodome. After this season they will be p;laying in their new stadium by the convention center. I think the convention center is a bit of a waste since Houston doesn't seem to land many consequential national level events there. But that's Houston for  you'. They never seem to get the kind of national coverage that New York or la gets. I guess that is because it is considerably smaller, but still. I think it has to do with Houston being a bit excluded from the rest of the country. And with the lack of national events and tourism people will continue to think Texas is all about cowboys and cattle wtith a few oil ranchers thrown in th e mix. ",0
"will the cowboys win this game, who knows, why even care, will I be approved for a credit card application that I just filled out? I wonder if I'm going to be called by a friend to eat lunch, I'm not hungry, because I just ate, not really in the mood for jester food, stomach hurts a little from working out yesterday, not too bad, I hope I do good in all my classes this year. theres a lot of dust in my room. I need to get my friend to make his business run better. hes not a good business man. I get him all his business. I need to clean my room, at least my side. I don't know why I bought my caller id thing, I don't even have caller id service. it wouldnt help much anyway. I want to watch the game, but I have to write this assignment. I wonder what I will do today. I want to visit some friends. I wonder why I can wake up so early and all my friends sleep so late. cowboys are doing good this game, since I can hear the game going on. I wish I had a source of income right now. I don't know how I am going to pay for my cell phone bill and the money for the frat I'm rushing for. I'm glad I didnt drink last night, I feel pretty good today, except for a running nose. wow my 20 minutes are almost done, I wonder if my parents are going to call today. I need my cell phone back from my friend. I wonder what this blue, stringy dust is that is all over my stuff. oh look, my time is up, finally I'm done wit this, I'm glad I remembered to do this today. ",1
"     Oh man I'm so hungry. I can't wait for the football game tonight, it's going to be lots of fun. Wow, I think really fast, cause I'm so thinking about 3 things at once. Hunger, football, and the giant pre-screening survey thing that I just took. Can you believe that I finished it at 2:54, only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them. Man talking about some pressure. Speaking of pressure, I just thought of physics, which is kind of weird since I don't have physics this year. I do have math though. I played cards last time I was in class. We played this crazy Russian game. It was really cool. We tied in the end. ^_^ Wow, ok, so now that I typed ^_^, I thought of anime and forums since I use that on forums all the time, and it's an anime face. And now I'm thinking about how I can type without looking at the keyboard. I just moved the mouse, and that reminded me of a real mouse. Man, I make a lot of typos. Of well, did you know that I learned to type too early that I lifted my hands off the keyboard so I could type faster since, I had small hands. And so in I think 10th grade I had to fix myself, and retaught myself 10 finger typing. Cause you see this """"hover hands"""" typing caused me to look at the keyboard. The song just changed and it totaly distracted me. Speaking on Song, I met a girl named Helen Song, the first Day of Psycology and she's really cool. I like her a lot as a friend but at the same time I want to ask her out. But you know that my biggest fear (and pretty much the only one) is losing a friend. And so I have trouble asking girls out cause I'm afraid after they say no, that they don't want to be friends anymore. Why am I telling you this. Oh well, for all I know you don't read these, or you read them completely. Hehe, you know why do some people type hehe, and other haha. You told us to think about our reactions and our observations. I bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking, pay more attention to their random observation thoughts. I bet that produces a lot of weird data. Me, well I ask a lot of questions, and think really fast. I often find myself daydreaming. ALL THE TIME! hehe. so yeah, wow, hehe sounds like a girl to me. Not to self, refrain from saying hehe. I glanced at the clock for the first time. I wonder is that means that I'm finally bored after 8:30 minutes. But as I keep typing, huh, I thinking more about the actual act of typing. I just looked at the title, """"Stream of Consciousness of Writing"""" but now the music changed to a good song so I'm distracted from that last thought. This song is good. It's techno. I know that I listed to it cause it matches my lifestyle, fastpassed? wow, I can't spell. So yeah, my SAT score was 580 reading and 780 math. That's just a little weighed don't you think ^_^. There it is again. I just though of the entire universe and big guns, and planets and spaceships, this is going by way faster than I can type, but trust me that I'm having a ball here. Soccer, now that I haven't played in a while, and I just started playing tennis. That was tiring, but I want to work to be the best. StarCraft, and my daydream story just came into my mind. You see in order to pass the time I come up with a story and slowly play it out in my head with extreme detail. A single day dream could take up to month to complete, as I start and stop it when neccissary. Man, I'm getting excited about football. You know I've never seen a whole football game before. I'm sweating, maybe I should go turn down the AC, neh, that's my mom's domain, and well I don't want to stop typing. What only 6 minutes left, Well I suppose that means 75% of the time has passed. I wonder why I converted this into a percentage. That's really weird you know. Talk, that's what my phone said, cause it didn't ring, huh, strange, why would I type that. I think that means I'm focussing too much on typing and not enough on other events, although I suppose it really doesn't matter does it. But as I progress I think more and more about my typing. So do you know javascript, did you create that timer, or did you 'steal' the code for it, and use it on you site. I hadn't noticed this song was annoying till now. I normally listen to music when on my computer, you know like browsing the web, or photoshoping (digital image creation). The only times I don't have it on is when I watch anime, or play a game. Speaking of anime, I just finished watching wow ok like 5 titles flashed through my head. Hellsing, that was the last one I watched. You know I like anime much better than TV cause they can create a long drawn out plot which is infinitly better than a single 30 minute plot. It's like watching a book rather than reading one. Reading, the last thing I read was a StarCraft book, yeah it came from the game. That's sad I know, but I just couldn't focus on Lord of the Rings you know. I wonder how much other people type, I mean, am I a fast typer. The amount they turn in has to be due to the typing speed and not the thought speed let me tell you, cause we think incredibly fast.

first a bit of background  last Friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice  I guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened I guess I am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now I'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid I wonder why I mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so  really I just kid of went on with my life so I'm not dwelling on the crash what I am dwelling on is the fact that I was over the crash in a meter of minutes  this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine  I'm not more or less kind I don't enjoy life more  I even had fun that weekend  I don't feel that I am truly any closer to God   I am not praying any more  not that that is how I judge my relationship with God but even how I judge my relationship a no closer  weird I should have done this later on I think better at night but if I wrote what I was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper I would lose these thought so I guess it is better this way I can always rewrite what I type onto paper but then I would feel the urge to revise and I haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet I mean what is what I truly think and feel what is  spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what I can put together over time so I haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what I write neater or type it  I guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as I think why I write on paper what I this but then even I can't read what I write half the time    on a more petty note I am worried about math I just have no idea what to expect but that is something that I can put to the back o my mind   I'm trying not to think of anything school related because I want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok I'm worried about math because I don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests  oh well   ,0
"     I am really tired. I got up this morning at 7:45 to go get tickets for the seniors in my fraternity, and I don't even know if I'll get to go. They're for the Texas vs. OU game in October. I was up last night until 3:30 and I had to wake up at 7:45 this morning to go wait in line at the stadium. I have the song   Nashville Blues   by Cory Morrow in my head because last night, after walking Rachel back to her room, I came in to find three half-naked, drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate. They were making him play   Nashville Blues   while they sung and taped the entire episode. They claimed to be filming   Towers Gone Wild,   which was a take-off of   Girls Gone Wild,   only filmed at Towers. I have recently been seeing a cute girl, but I am sort-of afraid of commitment. Twenty minutes seems to me like a long time to type. I've barely made it through six minutes, and I am pretty much ready to go to bed and stop doing this. This girl is really cute and sweet, but I just got over a really hard break-up, and I am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen. I think that it is funny that, although I'm supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness, my spelling and grammar are almost impeccable. I wonder if the person who reads this will agree. I probab;y made a typo on some really easy word, and therefore the grader will assume that I am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults. Or maybe that's me talking. Maybe I'm   grading   myself when I say something like that. Nine minutes and forty three seconds. It's funny that by the time I had written   nine minutes and forty three seconds,   that time had passed. I am now very ready to stop this assignment. Twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for, but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping. I wonder what Tank is doing. I wonder if Laurie is going to come over to   see   him. I don't like Laurie very much. I think she's very annoying. She whines far too much. Now I'm whining about her. I hope I'm not keeping my roommate up with my typing. This keyboard is pretty loud. I still have to write for another seven minutes. My neck itches. There, that's better. My composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since I mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar. Tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought. He doesn't really respect people's space too much. But he's an overall pretty good guy. If I go to sleep in fifteen minutes, I can take a three and a half hour nap before I have to be at the house to build. I am not going to Philosophy. I am too tired. I don't really think I'll be missing too much, because if I did go, I would fall asleep in there as well. My bed is much more comfortable than those tables in the Law Building. That is a really long walk. I takes thirty minutes. My back hurts. I need a shower. I need a cup of iced tea. I actually don't NEED either of those. I just WANT a shower and a cup of iced tea. And a nap. I'm a pretty funny guy, if I put my mind to it. Right now, I'm not putting my mind to anything but sleep. English was boring today. just like every other day. I think I probably failed that reading quiz. I probably got a fifty. I read about fifty percent of the selection. My professor must be pretty good at making quizzes if they're that accurate. I never had that happen in high school. I'm just going to stop now. Good night. ",0
Trying to track my thoughts. That's weird because I don't even know were to start. At the moment I am wondering who just called because I thought one of my roommates would of answered it but they didn't and who every it was hung up. I am also worried about my food that is cooking in the oven. It is suppose to be done in thirty minutes and I sure am hungry. I kind of mad at the moment because the Cowboys just lost to the Cardinals and they shouldn't have. To tell you the truth its kind of hard to sit here and just type what I am thinking  because I not thinking of anything. One of my roommates is talking on the phone and being really loud but she does have a big mouth. She is talking to my other roommate and asking him if he wants to meet the person on the phone for lunch tomorrow but they never ask me but I don't mind because the guy they are meeting gets on my nerves. That was weird. An icon came up on my screen and said my connection has been idle for twenty minutes and will disconnect if I don't  click on the stay connected. I guess that means I have been typing for twenty minutes or maybe not. It is weird the way I have been typing for so long and I am just on the second line. I know I have typed more than that I hope. My back is starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly in this chair and typing  but I guess I have typed for twenty minutes so I can stop now. I probably didn't type that much but I am not a good typer and I make a lot of mistakes. I guess I'll stop now. ,0
"As I am writing this, the Red Sox are playing the A's. I think this really may be  the year for the Sox. I hope so because how cool would it be to see the """"Curse of  the Bambino"""" broken. Their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing  the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching. They look like  the 1996-2001 Yankees. I'm ready for a World Championship for my Sox. I just read an email from home, from my Dad. I miss him, just having someone  around to talk to. I guess I am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad  that I do, most guys don't. I mean, not many people have  the kind of Dad who  taught them how to play sports and things like that, but I have vivid memories of  being 8 and 9 years old and my Dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the  ferry. With football season starting, I really realize how much I miss the game. I mean,  it's been 6 years since I DIDN'T play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting  hard. I miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of Friday Nights,  being the Captain. I miss D a lot too. we had such a crazy fall last year, always  know that we should be together but never being able to get it right. I miss 8th  periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking. I miss Saturdays, the days  after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with Micah. I've  been gone 3 weeks, and I'm not homesick, I'm just kind of missing the Crew. I miss  Meghan a lot. For 4 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and I  really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that I am one of the biggest  things in her life too. Which is good, because I really cannot see either of us  drifting away from the other. I hope Andrew is doing ok. I'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him. He  really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention  for being the """"Big Guy"""", the built guy. a school like this would be terrible for his  self-esteem. But oh well, whatever floats your boat, right?  I really hope Micah does ok. that kid has never been in a social group or circle  that I didn't bring him into. He may really struggle with finding his niche at school. I  hope not thought, he's my best friend and I need him to be self-confident and  happy so I can stop worrying about him. I can never really tell if worrying about  people is a good thing or a waste of time. I worry so much about Meghan, with her  mother walking out on her and everything. and Meghan is so reclusive when it  comes to her emotions, even to me. it betrays her every once in a while thought,  when I have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a  basic human reaction/emotion out of her. I hope D is doing ok. being the only one of US not to go to college has to take it's  toll on her. but from what she says, she is getting her act together. I just couldn't  take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy  as Lee. thank God she's finally going in the right direction. Maybe I won't have to  live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road  somewhere. Of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me. Going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does  making me feel satisfied that I AM having an impact in someone's life. or, a lot of  someone's. I really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that I invest so much  of myself into those people. and I really believe it has paid off. My family seems to being doing well. I'm glad. The girls will be back in school  soon, and next year Maggie will be in my position. That's crazy. Go Sox. ",0
"Stream of Consciousness? Well actually I've never done this before but it seems like there's nothing to it. I just tell you what I'm thinking, right? Well here is what I am feeling. Right now I am feeling anticipation because I have a load of laundry going downstairs. I really cant wait till its done. I guess this feeling of Anticipation is only natural since I am doing laundry. If I wasn�t doing laundry and I still felt like I was waiting for something then that might be a little bit out of the ordinary. I am also feeling a tad fatigued, considering that I have been up on my feet all day. I sense that I could also trace that to the fact that I only  got five hours of sleep last night. I cant stop typing for twenty minutes I cant stop typing for twenty minutes. This stream of consciousness stuff is really bizarre. It really makes absolutely no sense to me. That might be considered a  feeling of confusion or bewilderment stemming most likely from my misunderstanding of this assignment. From what I write will you guys over there be able to tell  what kind of person I am? There you go, another sensation: one of curiosity. That is I wonder why on earth am I doing this. I guess there can also be a slight feeling  of frustration since I am doing  something that I do see the purpose of. One thing that I do notice is that there are no margins on this site, so if I wanted to I could write and write and write and write and make one really long line , in a sense a veritable stream of consciousness. That wasn�t very clever. Anyway I was also wondering how many people create a phantom margin like I have been doing what does that tell you or me about me. Do I like order or do I like being able to see everything that I have written in front of my face. Well do you know what? Its both. I like order most of the time. I need to keep on typing I need to keep on typing I need to keep on typing. Another sensation I feel you say? Hunger. I have not  eaten in a while. Also I only ate one meal today. I guess that is a sign of stress. I am usually not that stressed out. I don�t really feel too much stress. My sleeping patterns are relatively normal(except for last night). I really cant figure out what this assignment does. Is this supposed to help me or you? IS this apart of some survey or something? From analyzing all these stream of consciousness documents will you be able to certain things and similarities we all share, thought patterns and what not? By the way, who should I be talking to anyway? I have been using """"you"""" for a while. I feel like I've been talking to """"you"""" for so long and we haven't even met. How's it going? My name is Walker. It is a  pleasure to meet you, """"you. """" Introductions aside, let's get back to this S. O. C. nonsense. Actually, let's not; my time is up. Take it easy. ",0
"I'm always the last one to know he said. I know the feeling. What can I do to reach you?           You can know anything he said. but I didn't ask- I didn't know how. and is the offer still there? Are we ready to take it?  We've passed being ready. We never had a real beginning or middle- just skipped into this end? I want to slip into reverse. Where is our beginning?  Did it die when we said I love you?  You make it too powerful- I make it romantic abandon. I was afraid. I think I'm losing you- and I don't know how to fight that. I'm not sure I really know what we mean. . Maybe I was wrong for holding back- but you held back too- We both did. Let us lie together and hold one another and love. I look at you. looking at me. seeming wonder- take your hat off. smile at me through the cracks in your skin. Why do I get this feeling that in the course of my life I will have to become a Queen of letting go-?    . . a master. an expert- flawless mover. mask of beauty. horror. What is real?  I know. got me a name- but names change. Have this face. so do they sometimes. still, here I am. can close my eyes. learn to fly. far away-  To someplace where faces are real. no gunk to cover 'em. no baggage to smash 'em. I am only as free as I really want to be. As I allow myself to be- Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose- you go Janis baby- I don't remember the last time I was free. security. A face is security. can be. Lie down- daydream. sleep things off- give it time, start over. I'm so lonely. need to find someplace in myself- tap into my soul and dig out the pain. You Dwell on answers without thinking and lose yourself temporarily- What is the answer?  Hey didn't you know that 42 is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?  Bet on that 42- whatever 42 is. Go with it- run with- and try not  to think too hard about the way you see him- the way they curve in your mind- try to fill the empty space beside you with movement- try not to stop and then you won't miss. but that's not true. The Talmud had it right- We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are. And that is the sole truth- even when we think we cannot see ourselves. ",0
"Yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with. One interesting part to me is the Occipital Lobe. Three years ago I was in a car accident, which I have fully recovered from, expect I have blurred vision in my right eye. Within a few months after the accident I went to many doctors to see what the problem was. One doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight. He said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened. He also said that I would never regain my eyesight in that eye. Now that it's three years later, there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process. Another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain. He told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things. Sometimes during the semester I may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professional's opinion. I do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so I would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it. ",0
"I'm thinking about bush and religion. I just had a simi arguement about it. I don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone. country music isn't that bad.

I don't like being stuck down here. my room is really quiet. so is my roommate. we don't talk much. hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit. my legs itch and so does my back.

I can't wait til next summer. college intern at cypress united methodist. 200 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today. some people from the mission trip knew her. its so sad to be taken at such a young age. texas better beat arkansas Saturday. ill be pissed if they lose again to them.

I want to play raquetball. it was great when I hit ash in the head with the ball and then when I fell on my butt when trying to serve. great times. my beard still itches.

I'm hungry. what can I eat. ice cream is good. already had it today. jester express might still be open. I have to check  hey, movies are on tonight. SCREAM is on. cool. I think I'll watch it. time is up. ",0
"It is 4:07 and I am supposed to be in psychology right now. When I got out of class at 3 I just walked to the bus and came home. Then at 4 I realized that I had skipped class. I have no idea how I could do that without even realizing it. My mind is working too fast and I am too focused on other things. Maybe starting Adderral again yesterday had some effect. It speeds up my thoughts rather than focusing them on the matter at hand. Now I'm not sure if that is going to be as helpful to me with school as it will be harmful. My apartment is too quiet. I just wrote to Coody and asked him to play a Modest Mouse song next time. He won't. That would be too weird for everyone. I would have volunteered to be class dj if I thought everyone wouldn't hate it and glare at me. I was also afraid my cd's would skip. They're all scratched. I can't believe I missed class, especially by accident. I feel ridiculous. Especially since I don't know anyone in the class to get notes from. Or I probably do but I don't know it because there are 500 people in there. I wonder. It has only been 4 minutes and 16 seconds, this feels a lot longer than I thought it would. I'm writing a lot more than I thought I could. Friendster is improving my typing, that's a depressing thought. I need to get off the internet and study. I need to study the Jeffersonian idea, how interesting. I think if I could go back and stop the manufacturing and the advance of technology I would. It would be so nice to live off my own land, to be self-sufficient. I wish I could have started that way, because I'm too selfish to give it all up now. It would be impossible as well. The world doesn't leave room for that anymore. Anti-Flag sang about the kid saying, If you hate America so much, why don't you move to Russia?!"""" Ignorance is funny. My foot itches. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning after philosophy. I really don't want to go. Or I wish there was no reason for me to go. I am never healthy for more than a week straight. There is always something wrong, something to deal with, worry about, or panic over. I am so tired of that. 8 minutes and 22 seconds, almost half way. This is very strange. I haven't done this since 7th grade. Then it wasn't for 20 minutes and it was more like """"poetic"""" rambling, not full sentences. This is strange because my mind is going way faster than my fingers. My typing is not good. I never learned to keep my fingers on the """"home keys"""", and for that Mrs. somebody smacked me on the head with her rolled up papers. That was special. Now I am halfway through. Is halfway a word? I think it is two words. Oops. I have so much work to do; it is overwhelming. I could stay in all weekend and finish it, but then I might go stir crazy. Plus so many people want to meet me this weekend. I don't want to meet anyone with this stuff on my face. I felt good until I got it, now I really don't want anyone looking at me. And now the antibiotics are making the rest of me worse. Plus my face is not getting any better. I am looking forward to the vegan potluck anyway though. Maybe it will be dark in there and I can be a little bit more comfortable. I wish Ross and Jimmy weren't going though. The sound of typing is starting to annoy me and make me space out. I wish they weren't going because I want to meet all new people without anyone who knows the """"old me"""". And without anyone who will report back to Drew. I want to feel free, not be looking over my shoulder. This is so frustrating. I was so glad to move away from everyone, and three people followed me here. And now probably another will. No, I want only new friends. Not that I don't like the old, I just want to move own. I don't want to be tied down to one me forever. I have never gotten a fresh start in my life and college is the time to do it. After it will be way too hard because I won't meet people. After school people don't really make an effort to reach out and make friends and involve people. What do you do when you meet someone new? Do 35 year olds go around exchanging phone numbers and hanging out? Maybe they do, I don't know. But I wanted to start over and now I can't. And there is nothing I can do about it. Absolutely nothing. Now my face itches. Car tires are screeching outside. The bus driver drove us home in an insane manner today. He told us to hold on, and we did. It was strange. Now it's been 17 minutes. Birds are chirping outside. Something in my room just made a noise. Ramsi is sleeping under her box. She was out eating this morning. It was cute. I feel good that I've given her a better home. I need to go shopping for some new clothes and I really need to cut my hair before everyone I know does it, and then I look like I'm copying everyone. I hate that. I think I'll cut it chin length and get blonde highlights. I need to find a Goodwill to shop at. But I bet all the good clothes are bought up in Austin. I don't want to go to one of those expensive vintage stores on the drag though. Oh, less than 40 seconds left. Now I'm just thinking about the forty seconds and where I'm going to get cut off and that's strange. Is it going to stop me? Or am I ",1
"What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 1% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish Lindsay would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss Lindsay. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 25% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 4:50 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the Amazon. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 50% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten"""", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw Cedric Benson in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 75% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (7:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how Phoebe is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. ",0
"I don't really know what to think about really anything. I mean some things are so clearcut and others just float off like there is no answer or any point in thinking about them. Why do I cry so much. Why do I need to talk so much why do I need so much. I don't know all the answers and I don' t know all the emotions either, but I do know that sometimes I feel different and like things aren't right. And how do you know when things are right. Is Brian right just because my head is telling my heart that he is cute and cool and what I maybe have been looking for? But then other things I just know are right when Lilly and are goof off and are being silly we have so much fun. But then how will they all think of me when they know the truth and is it really that big of a deal or is it because I make it a big deal. Oh my gosh it has only been three and a half minutes. What is wrong w/ me? My arms will fall off before I finish this writing assignment. But really who will know if I don't tell them but I want to tell people and have them love me and speaking of people I know and love I wonder how Kelsey is I hope she has made some more friends who are girls. I know that I can't be there but I hope that she does make some because she needs to realize she is more than just a body and a set of boobs to them. Or at least I want her to know that and maybe I should just say things like that. Wow my arms hurt. But I have been typing for a while already and the blinking light from AOL instant messenger is going to piss me off so I have to turn it off now. Ah. so much better. Now I can concentrate and not really concentrate wow I love paradoxes. I wonder if you should or rather could say paradox like with the funky ways of making plurals like alumnae and alumna and stuff like that. And is swang really a word when not used as a term for dancing or in the more rural and uneducated parts of the world. And in America how many places are really uneducated and how do we know that we are uneducated. I mean after all who are we to judge. I don't think that there is any person who can judge either other people or themselves. But we all do it and anyone who says that they are not judgmental are flat out lying. I mean really. I am going to try and move my keyboard to a new position to better accommodate my wrists and arms and fingers. I hope that I get a ticket to ou weekend. And better yet I hope I get a date. I would like to go there w/ Brian, but I don't know if he likes me or is just pressured by other people, like my friends, into thinking that I am some kind of cool. I wish I could just know but that is not my place. I don't get to know things. I think he feels obligated and just like the she daisy song I do not want to be anyone's obligation. I have too much pride and maybe I have so much it will hurt me, but I don't want to be anyone's' obligation until they decide themselves that they want to care for me. I don't want a person colossal  who feels obligated to me because of what I have done or what people say about me or whatever I want some one who will want me. Why doesn't anyone want me or do I not let them see me and if I do let them see me am I risking everything I work for everyday to make sure that I have a pretty face to show the world but I seem so unfriendly sometimes like at meetings. I don't try and meet the girls especially the one who looks like Mel's sister because it makes me think bad things. But oh I am a horrible person. Why would anyone want me especially with all this bad karma and not that I believe in karma I just believe in the modern translation that it relates to the soul and goodness and badness and evilness, but I am evil and I have all these negative thoughts and I am not bitter though, at least I pray to God that I am not bitter because bitterness really does breed filth and hatred and unhappiness. I want to be happy and praise God with all of my song and being but all these things get in the way and other stuff and I am so unhappy about stuff sometimes. I just need to cry and I want a big comfy shoulder to cry upon and someone special to hold me tight and say that everything will be all right. that is from some song but that is what I want. I want the security of a guys arms wrapped around me but I know that is not really security that all that is is a cheap imitation of what God can give to me through Jesus. But I just right now would love to be wrapped up in a great big hugpreferably with Brian around me, but I don't know. I hope I don't get obsessive about him like I did with Tony and with Jonathan and so many other people. I just think that things are good and that I feel really comfortable around him but at the same time he reminds me of all the boys I hung out with that were Bass's friends. And that is cool because they were cool but I don't know if I am deep down cool enough for Brian and all of his friends or if I want to try. But I do, but only if it is the right thing and if it is then God will bring it together but I know that I have to do my part and pray and think of what God can do and not worry about other things but it all works out in the end. God keeps us safe. It all works out. ",0
"I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 2 or 3 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 5, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 5. Good I have until 9 to study until people come over. 4 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. ",0
"     lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 13 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 1. instructor, 2. teachers assistant, 3. myself, 4. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a1 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 2 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 20 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face ",0
"People laugh at the same things over and over. There doesn't seem to be any diminishing of reward. No matter how long a joke has been around, no matter how old the recipient is; the same things seem to make people laugh. Why is that? Maybe it's because we like hearing the same stories over and over, associating them with our memories. Like """"Star Wars"""". Nobody today looks at Star wars and says, """"man, check out those models! No strings? How did they do that?"""" or, """"Man, that Hark Hamill is a great actor!"""" But most of us can remember a time when we would have said that, so we just watch it over and over and over again. Nobody would do that with """"Schindler's List"""". And the fact that Schindler is now IN Star Wars just mucks it all up. That's why everyone thinks Episode One sucks they're beyond the point where they want to see any more of that. The fact is that they're all fairly crappy, especially Return of the Jedi. Good god, was that awful! But people go back and say it was the best, because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids. Come on, """"Care Bears"""" was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves. Why did we ever like that in the first place? Well, it was the 80's nothing else was on. How did the end of the 80's manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? Suddenly, everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science, or at least enough to talk about them, which was not at all. You barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something. I've seen """"very intelligent"""" high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues. They bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument, like the bible. What the heck does Isaih have to do with campaign finance reform? All the people in the bible lived under a sovereign government they didn't even have elections! There weren't even ideas at the time to compare to these, because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the Roman government, and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government. Since most of them got ripped off by being murdered, it's not like they can very well put forth a campaign. The Romans had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didn't like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of 35. Might as well have been anarchy, but then again, you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart. Of course, we know how well that strategy worked, considering the glory of the current Roman Empire. ",0
"At this very moment I am feeling slightly depressed. My roommate left for the weekend to go home and see her grandmother. That's great. The first weekend of school and she decides to go home. She left me all alone even for the first football game. It's not that I am totally stuck on my roommate but having her around is nice. It gives me someone to go and do things with and just some extra company. I'm also a little stressed. Moving to college has been fine for me. I haven't gotten home sick, really. And I'm having a lot of fun. But adjusting to how much work I have now is hard. I one of those people who needs to complete all tasks and be ahead of schedule if possible. That's impossible here. And if your not computer literate your screwd. So that means that I am screwed. But on the same notion, it forces me to learn about computers and how they work. I have no option if I want to succeed. Succeeding is important. I was valedictorian of my high school. I think that is a curse. It seems that the past valedictorians have failed at what they have attempted past high school. And it doesn't help that the entire community is watching either. I want to succeed and prove that theory wrong. I hope it happens. I really miss my boyfriend. that is an interesting story. He is 26 and lives in Dallas. What a bummer. Not that he is 26 but that he lives in Dallas. It is hard with our relationship sometimes because we come for two totally different worlds. Most of the time I don't know how to read him. What is he thinking?  That worries me most of the time. I don't want to seem totally dependent or ignorant or niave. We once got into a fight and he told me that I had become to dependent on him. That really pissed me off. I don't believe that I had become dependent so much as emotionally attached and bored. Bored because he had moved and I had nothing else going on at the time. How dare he call me dependent. How am I suppose to feel when he decideds to move off to Dallas and not visit that much using his job as an excuse. Dependent my ass!  It just really irritates me. But I don't know what to think about it. Moments like these, when I'm all alone is when I miss him the most. And I try not to think about him scared that it is making me dependent but at the same time I can't help it. then I have thoughts go through my head that maybe being dependent every now and then isint so bad. Its him that has the problem. Why does he have to be so independent?  I don't believe that someone can be totally independent. Everyone from one time to another needs someone. Everyone. So why does he have to act as if he doesn't. I wonder if my time is up yet. I honestly don't think that this has helped me much. Its just made me think more. Great. yes my time is up. good. ",0
"Right now I'm sitting here at the computer wondering what I'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. There is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. My computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. I keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! There is a lot of stuff on my desk, I need to clear it off. I also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. I forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. I need to study for chemistry because I have a quiz in there at 12:30. I tried to last night, but I kept on getting distracted. I don't feel like doing this right now. I want to go to sleep. I just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all I want to do is sleep. By the time I get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. I can't think of anything to type. I want to light a candle. I have a lot of time left and I still need to write. I'm not sure what about though. This weekend I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I guess I'll have fun. I did last weekend. I need to do some reading for my classes, and I can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that I don't have any classes on Friday. Right now I am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in Houston. We plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in Houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and Dag are planning it. Next weekend I am going to the UT Houston game and then right after that I plan on going home because the 24th is my Dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. That will be a busy weekend. The following one is my friend's birthday. My computer is still making some annoying noise. I can't think of anything to type. I have 10 minutes left of typing. Hopefully I can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. I'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because I noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. That would be very annoying to deal with, if I lived there! So I'm glad I don't. Yesterday there was a lot of traffic. Today I get out of school at 3:30 and I have a trig review class at 5:30. I wish I didn't have to go, but I get extra credit for my calculus class, which I figure I will need. I need to balance my checkbook. I think I'll do that when I finish typing this. I'm going to listen to some CD's when I finish this too. I don't feel like studying, and I guess I'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. I wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, I'll have to check that out in a minute. My desk is really cluttered, I need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that I keep on forgetting about. Well, I have a lot more stuff to do than I thought! It's driving me crazy that I keep on making so many typos, I never have this problem. Wow, I've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! That's kind a cool. I thought that a I would have written more in 20 minutes though. I guess not. Surprisingly the time went by very quickly, I didn't think that it would. I guess in a minute I will log on so that I can get on to the psychology website and send this in. ",1
"Well today I went with my friend Kai to his Texas Crew orientation. He tried to get me to join, but I just don't think that Crew would be the sport for me. I prefer to play volleyball above all other sports. Just this past week, I signed up for the volleyball teams here at UT. I would really enjoy to play for the school, or at least on a team, competing with others. I used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in Houston, I guess that's why I like it so much. I miss being around my family, but I know that they are proud of me for being here at UT. I wanted to go back this weekend, since it's a 3 day weekend, unfortunately, I am a little behind in my classes, so I wanted to take advantage of this time to  catch up and maybe get ahead a little. The reason which I am behind in my classes, which is so unlike me, is probably because I am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time. I believe that this is happening because of the long summer. Well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me, which for some reason I have been avoiding. I guess because I don't want anything to do with him, I don't even consider him a good friend. Just now, my friend whom which I met through Hang Out, a gay organization here on campus, instant-messaged me asking me to go out. He has been taking me out, to places I wouldn't even think of going, since I arrived here at UT. Now him I do consider him a good friend. He is a really good guy, really fun to be around with. I don't know if I am starting to develop feelings for him, which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school. I spent last night at his house, just hanging out, talking about whatever came to our minds, and fell asleep on his bed. Nothing happened, but for some reason, I sort of wanted something to. I believe that I wanted something to happen because I have been feeling very lonely these past few days, maybe because of I need a boyfriend, or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give, or not going home for the weekend. Or maybe I just genuinely like him. Well I guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in Houston 2 days ago, and my mom is going to mail it to me, and if all goes as planned, I will be able to keep the money for myself, if financial aid allows me to. So I will use that money to pay off my bank bill. And today, my mom called, and I felt like I was there even though we are 3 hours away, which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend. Right now, I don't want a boyfriend for various reasons. One, I have decided to put off sex until I get tested for HIV. I don't have suspicions that I may have it, but I have had unprotected sex, and so I just want to be sure. Second, I need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me. Third, I just don't know if I can handle going through what I went through with my ex all over again. Not that it would necessarily happen again, but I just don't want to take the risk. Or maybe I should just be brave and take a risk. I need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision. ",1
"The one thing that amazes me the most is the  complexity of the female mind. At one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. Also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. If you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. The more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. The only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. True, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. No matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. I've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand. The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. The more you drink it in, the better it feels. You know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. Then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. Reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. The only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. The old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. It may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. Somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. That or it seems less pathetic.     It's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. When I was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. My parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that I listened to, so I always told myself that if I ever became a musician, I would never include those kind of things in my songs. However, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. However, I wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of Eminem. I also think that people overreact to his music. He is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician. ",0
"The problem I have with this writing assignment is that there is so much going on in my life right now that all of these different worries and concerns keep popping into my head. The one thing that I am looking forward to is that today I am meeting my parents in La Grange for dinner. They are giving me my fraternity dues in the form of a check and my answering machine . My pledge brother Brian is listening to MTV right now so it is very hard to concentrate and rigit is pissing me off. My humanities course is causing me a lot of stress because the teacher did not pass out any kind of syllabus so I have no idea how I will be graded. It just occurred to me that this essay is sounding more like the second writing assignment than the first, but I guess it doesn't really matter if school is what's on my mind. The girl next door has been on my mind a lot. Lately I find myself wondering what she is doing even though we agreed to be just friends because she lives next door. And now that I think about it another girl is always on my mind too. However she lives upstairs and I'm pretty sure I could hook up with her if I wanted. I am very excited about my fraternity. I am looking forward to our bar tap on Friday and I have promised myself I wouldn't drink until then. I really need to establish a routine, because I think once I do that I will be a lot less stressed. I need to start working out again to so that I won't feel like a complete piece of crap for partying too much. Last night I went to San Marcos to see the girl I am kind of dating but actually I don't feel any kind of affection for her. Which is something I should tell her because she apparently likes me alot. I think I am starting to get kind of sick . Probably has something to do with the fact I go to bed between 5 and 6 every night, but at least I scheduled afternoon classes. ",0
"Well right now it's 10:50 and I am thinking I'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then I'll get something to eat, I feel very hungry it is probably because I didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway I just remembered I have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time I get home I am going to be so tired that I would just want to go to bed but no I have to cut the grass I guess I should forget about going to the gym today even though I promised myself I will go to the gym every Tuesday and Thursday. but o well at least I don't have to work today thinking about work I remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun I haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 6 minutes that I have been writing. I wander if I should return my study guide for calculus. I don't know if I need it or not. I am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. I don't know maybe 40 dollars. It makes the job easier but at the same time I have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free I don't even know him. I was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well I probably should give him a gift card of some sort. Maybe I'll get one from work like a 30 dollar gift certificate. I feel kind of dizzy. I went to sleep late and then I had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 8:30 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that I had questions about. and now I have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. My eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. I don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. Well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun I have had so far today, but still I just can't wait to get out of here. But hey where am I going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? Or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no I am hungry I probably should get something to eat I don't know if I should call Vivian see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. I could call Lisa, I have to call somebody because I hate eating by myself. ",0
"Well, I just got back from my Zeta meeting. It was cool. After the meeting, we went to this show where this guy hypnotized people. It was so funny!  Some of my pledge sisters where some of the subjects. It was hillarious to see them and the funny things he made them do. I can't believe I waited until now to write this. I'm usually the type of person who gets things done ahead of time. I think all of this freedom makes me feel like I have nothing to do. I missed a homework assighnment in Kinesiology the other day. I couldn't believe it. Tomorrow we're going to have this """"relationship talk"""" with the Delts. It's going to be really fun, I can't wait. This time is going by really slowly, I just know that I'm going to run out of stuff to say. I'm really hungry, I haven't eaten since 5:00. I've noticed that I eat more often now. I think it's because I work out (or try to) three times a week. I always feel so much better when I work out. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it up for the rest of the year. The dreaded """"freshman fifteen""""  is not going to get me!  This Thursday, I have a meeting with my doctor about my knee. It's been giving me problems. I had surgery on it last October. The crappy thing is that my other knee is starting to feel the same way. God, why was I born with ghetto knees?  Okay, I feel like I've been writing forever and it's onlt been 10 minutes. I am dreading all of the writing I'm going to have to do next semester. English is going to suck next semester!  I've never been any good at English. I don't enjoy it in the least bit. On the other hand, I love this psychology class!  Every day I get to come, I look forward to it. Our professor is hilarios. I don't know what it is that makes him such an awesome teacher, he just is. Every day, I come home and tell my roommate all that we discussed that day. I enjoy reading our textbook, I actually find the information interesting!  (much unlike my other classes)  I wish Psychology was a more job-promising field. I would definately look into it if it was. Okay, five more minutes, I think I can BS my way through it!  I'm waiting on my this guy Kevin to call me. I'm not sure what exactly he is to me. We're dating, and we wouldn't date anyone else, but I feel funny calling him my boyfriend. Okay, my roomate just blared the TV. If I did that while she was trying to do homework, she would eat my head off!!!!!  Okay this last minute will be used to sign off. I wish all of my writing assignments were this easy!  There, D-O-N-E! ",1
"I'm feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to """"cool off"""". I really like it here at UT. everybody is very nice. I�m trying to think of what to type. I�ve got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. I�m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask Emily to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she """"just friended"""" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emily�s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. I�m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. I�ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think I�ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PC�s. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since I�ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. I�ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. I�m ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of Ginny. I�ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, Alabama. I�d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think I�m going to do well here. no problem. I�m very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. ",1
" Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of """"yey school is over"""" to """"wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. """"  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction.

"Well this weekend has been really different. I guess that's because it was the first"""" actual weekend that my friends and I actually went out and """"explored"""" Austin. I know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't """"explored"""" Austin, but I think it was better this way. The first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. It was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us. She had in a way """"made new"""" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in Austin. What was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. I don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving Austin (the party was in San Antonio) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. I was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. I feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. I guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. People are responsible for making their own decisions here. No one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. These people are adults now and can think for themselves. I also know that another reason I didn't want to or even want to go home until I really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family, especially my mom. I know that I'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time I talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last Thursday, I felt like I needed to cry. I don't know why I felt like that. I know that we're very close but I really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. I also have another worry on my mind. One of my guy friends had be accepted to the University of Houston and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. My guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. And this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and I, nearly every day together. Or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. To me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but I don't know if that would be normal because I haven't really been in a relationship like that. Well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the University of North Texas in Denton). Every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. And my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. And of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. Well the University of Houston started two days before we did and that Monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. Well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to Denton. And he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. What we don't understand is why he decided that. This is his first relationship and they already have given each other """"a promise ring"""" or a """"promise gift"""" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. What my friends and I don't understand is what is going on through his head. Well my time is almost up. I have like ten seconds left so I guess that's it. ",1
"o. k. now I have 20 minutes to write whatever I'm thinking. Humm. That's a lot of time and to be honest I can't think of anything to say right now. I'm tired and hungry even though I just ate. Overslept last night so my body is killing me at the moment. Busted my head playing football yesterday and now my head is killing me. Glad I didn't have to get stitches cause that would have been bad considering that would cost a lot plus I don't like stitches. I don't like needles at all for some reason. I want to be a doctor though so that is kind of crazy. How can you be a doctor if you don't like stitches. Well a couple minutes have passed and basically I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. You want me to talk about my feelings huh. I'm tired, miss home, and uncomfortable basically. I feel good right now I guess, I mean I'm not cold or anything or hot. Just sitting here without my shirt in a chair. You told me not to correct my spelling but I missed the r in shirt earlier and spelled shit, and well I don't want to say just sitting here without my shit, so I corrected it. I'm a pretty good typer I guess. I know where all the keys are and everything and I don't make too many mistakes. I'm using AOL and one of my friends keeps instant messaging me and well I can't reply back cause I have to get this done. I keep putting this assignment off, because I'm with this fraternity phi-psi and well it takes up a lot of my time and I really don't have much time to get on the computer and do this. I could easily have done it on paper cause we have to be at the house for 3 hours everyday for study hours. The thing is we don't have computers there and we are supposed to be in this room doing our homework, and well hard to do this assignment when you don't have a computer handy. It says to do it in seperate days, but I just finally remembered to do this. Actually I knew yesterday but the whole day I was at the frat house doing chores to get ready for the big party. I then went to the big party and had a good time. I know you're probably thinking, if you have time to go to the party then you had time to do this. My answer is true very true, but when you spend 4 hours getting ready for a party you want to enjoy it you know what I mean. I'm really tired of doing this. 20 minutes is a long time and there are some football games going and I want to watch them and well if I do then I won't be able to type cause my mind would be somewhere else. I cleaned my room the other day and so it looks pretty nice. My roomates side is really bad, but mine looks good so that's all that matters. I'm with the phi-psi fraternity and he's with the ATOs and well they are the biggest rival fraternities on campus. Don't really know much about it, except for the fact they hate each other. All I know is that phi-psi put a sign up in front of the ATO house that said something like you can't spell faggot without ATO. That was pretty creative in my opinion so I give them credit for that. Humm. nothing much to say, and still have a couple more minutes to ramble and ramble. I'll sing some songs, that'll pass the time. Under the bridge downtown I used to something something, o. k. so I don't know that one. It must be your skin cause I'm sinking in, it must be your feel cause I cannot feel, it must be your . O. k. don't know that one either. I remember when we used to sit in the county yard of brooklyn. Good times we had oh good times we lost a long the way a  you aya ay. No woman no cry. No woman no cry. Say say. Hey little sister, don't shed no tear. That's all I know about that one. I'm sure I know a song completely just can't think of any right now. Really don't listen to the words anyway. Always pay attention to the beat, cause I play guitar and I like to play and listen to the instruments rather than the words. I don't know just do. Time is winding down. To be honest I forgot when I started. I think it was 2:06 and well it is now 2:23 so it is almost time. Really want to watch the cowboy game, cause it's going on right now. Jeopardy themes song. Do do do do   do do do   do do do do  do do do do do do  do do do do do do do   do do do do do do   do   do do. O. k. that was a waste of time. I wonder if you actually time this. like if it is a test to see who really finishes this crazy test. 20 minutes is a long time, and well I'm as impatient as someone who really has to pee and is waiting on a stall. I like using analogies, makes things more interesting. Well I'm down to my final minute I think. If you are timing this than I tried to do the whole time, but I'm sick of being here. I'll give it another minute or two. Hummmm. That is all I'm thinking right now. La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La. It's that off to work we go song. We whistle that when we do work at the fraternity. It's kind of funny I guess. O. k. I gave it another minute and well peace I'm out of here. Actually I'll be right back cause I have to do the other assignment now. ",1
"I have to my homework. I have to study for my chemistry and history. I have to go to Houston this Thursday, so I wont attend class. I have so much shit to do. my mind is going blank right now. oh yeah. I have to go home and clean the dishes, wash my clothes, wake up at 9:00am, get ready and because of my homework I will not be able to go to sleep until 12:00. Tomorrow first thing in the morning, I have to pay my tuition bill of 4 dollars, go to the bookstore and buy my precal book and psy. book. right after I type this I have to go to HEB and do some grocery shopping. since I have no food at home I will buy milk, cereal, junk food, chips, pizza, juice, Gatorade, water, bathroom, paper, tilex mildew stain remover. this is hurting my neck. it really hurts. I need to go home and go to sleep I will be so happy after I get this assignment done; I will be done with at least one of my homework for school. I feel so tired right now; I just want to go home and go to sleep. I cannot stand being here [library] any longer than I have to. ",1
"     I want some ice cream. I will go get some as soon as I finish typing this. I wonder is someone is reading this because otherwise how can the computer analyze this?  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. too much studying to do. Maybe I should have done this on Friday morning. Oh well, I procrastinate too much so maybe this is a good thing. Gosh twenty minutes is a long time, especially when you are waiting to go get ice cream!  I'm not even hungry, but I haven't had ice cream is so long. Why do the guy floors in this building keep serenading?  Seems kind of odd that guys would do that for strangers. I like my room. It's very colorful, but I would still like to add more decorations. Perhaps more butterflies because it is a unique touch. Gosh, only a quarter done. I want my ice cream!!! Aww I can hear people yelling. how annoying. I would study in the library, but it seems kind of scary. This morning was scary. Yeah, I am never going to run by myself anywhere at 4:30 in the morning. I don't know if I want to make Texas Crew or not. It seems really cool and I got a rush just from exercising this morning, but on the other hand, it is also tiring, expensive, and I have to go through the trouble of finding a ride every day so I won't have to walk all the way to First Street again. Hmmm, I'm having trouble thinking of stuff. Oh I did not like today's   quote of the day  . It had something to do with God making the Earth round. I wanted to erase it, but I figured that might be a little rude. The sign should say   Monica's quote of the day   since I don't really care and I don't choose which ones go up there. I should have a   Drawing of the day   or something silly like that. Yeah, maybe of the week so I won't have to do so much. I prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. Man sometimes I am so evil, but deep down I believe I am good. Oh my goodness, I am only halfway done. Do I have to keep writing like this?  I'm not sure if I really think about stuff this often. I may be just searching for topics to write about. Kind of like small talk, which by the way I cannot stand, partially because I am no good at it. I can't wait until this weekend's field trip to Port Aransas!  I havent been on a field trip since like elementary school. Well, on a good field trip. Maybe that's because there is nowhere interesting to go in Texas, er Houston. This weekend is going to be so much fun, hopefully. I like a lot of the Women in Natural Sciences girls. A couple of the white girls seem kind of cocky though. Like my next door neighbor. She is never smiling, and she only comes over to talk if she wants something, such as markers. She came over the other day to ask for markers because she didn't want to use her sharpies because she said they would run out. Um, okay. so it's okay if other people's stuff runs out? Geez, and I see her talking to the professors alot trying to suck up. She annoys me already. Whoohoo only a minute and a half left! That's really what I'm thinking. Also I want to play ping pong downstairs with Edwina and Athena, but I probably don't have time because I procrastinated this weekend. Dang it. okay I will just wait for the time to run out. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. . 5. . 4. 3. 2. 1. yay ",0
"Wow, I really don't know what to write. All I know is that I'm kinda behind on  my studies. The bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of  school. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this, but I just can't seem to help it.  That's why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute. Bad, huh?   Hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. I just took  a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. I have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. I really miss my boyfriend. The funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that I'm Vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. Well his father is black and his mom is half Arabic and half French. My boyfriend,  Mohamed, was born in Africa but moved to Paris when he was only one years old. He's lived there for the past 18 years or so and have been here in the U. S for only two  years. He speaks five different languages. Pretty impressive, huh?  I have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I miss him sooo much. I wonder if he misses me or not. What do you think?  My problem is that  I'm not calling him until he calls me first. That's just the way I am. The guy always has to make the first move. I guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. I really hope he will call soon. I really, really miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. If my parents ever find out I'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely FREAK!  That's how they are. Actually, that's how  I kinda was. I told myself I would never ever like anyone but Asian guys. Boy, was I wrong. You know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. For some  reason, I'm sitting real straight up in my seat. I never do this when I'm just  typing for the heck of it. Maybe the fact that I know this is for a grade makes  me a bit uneasy. Oh well, I don't mind. There, I kinda sat back a bit and it  feels a little bit better now. I just yawned. great, I need to stay up kinda  late tonight to do some other homework. I have ten more minutes but I don't know what else to write. I guess I type kinda fast, and so it seems as though I'm  writing a whole lot, huh?  I don't know how you are going to grade this. I know  it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. I  bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh?  NO, I'm just kidding. . Oh, Oh, OH, OH, yeah, yeah. I love you more than I can say. , I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, Oh, OH, I love you more than I can say. OH, don't you know I  need you so, OH tell me please, I gotta know. Do you mean to make me cry?  Am I just another gal,  That was just a song that I usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. How do you like it?  It's kinda funny how sometimes I think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, I think I'm the ugliest troll. Why is that?  One day I would have complete confidence in myself and the next day I would feel so small and vulnerable. Why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially Asian guys. Well, I kinda know the answer to that question. Since I'm Asian and I want to meet an Asian guy, I tend to feel more self conscience when I'm  around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. I've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. Because I don't really see them as a potential romance interest, I am very relaxed and calm with them, and I guess we just click like that. I know I should do the same with Asian guys, but it's hard just b/c they're Asian, also. Why is it so complicate, man?  Well, tomorrow, my friend Cheryl and I are gonna take a bus to the mall. I've only been on the  bus twice here around campus. I've never taken a bus on a highway before. I  have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. Wish me luck. Man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! Isn't that weird?  Okay, I'm gonna stop Bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .              ",1
"About two weeks before I came to Austin I was already feeling the affect of college changing my life. Many of my friends left before I did and I said goodbye to all of them. I knew that it would be awhile before I saw any of them again. It feels really strange now that all the people that I have grown up with all my life are all going to new places. Many of the people from my high school I may never see again. Even though my high school was very large the faces I saw were familiar to me. Now that I am at the University of Texas many faces I have never come across before and that is a strange feeling. I kind of like having so many different people around. It just makes me feel better to know that I'm involved in such a large University. Everyone that I do meet is very nice and I am making many new friends. My roommate and I are getting along very well and I am glad that I have him as a roommate. I have seen many people from my high school, but many of the upperclassmen I knew from my school live off campus so I might only run into them every once in awhile. It is strange that I don't have a """"bestfriend"""" anymore because all of them are some other place. The people I hang with aren't as close to me as my old friends were. I guess that it has only been a couple of weeks so far and that is just how it will be until I live around here longer. I don't really wish that I had gone somewhere else, but I just get that home sick feeling a little. Home sick doesn't mean that I miss my parents so much, but just that all the people I was familiar with are gone. I don't really miss my parents that much yet, but I'm sure that I will soon when I finally realize that I'm not living there anymore and the UT is my home now. I wish that I had a car so that I could go places around here. I'm stuck on campus pretty much all the time. Almost everything that I need is here though so that is a good thing. I wish that I could have brought my turntables up to UT, but my parents didn't want me to yet. I hope that I can DJ at some clubs when I get a little more experience. My older friend was kind of my mentor to becoming a DJ and I'm hoping that he can give me the hook ups that I need to play at places. I don't like being alone in my room especially with the door shut it makes me feel closed off. If I'm here alone I will usually keep the door open so I can converse with the people outside. They have really good study rooms in the basement of my dorm and its really good to go down there and read or do homework. College so far has been pretty much what I expected it to be there hasn't been any real shockers yet. I only choose to come to UT my senior year. My parents both went to Arkansas so I didn't really have a bias to any college. I visited A&M and UT as well as OU and some other colleges last year and that is when I made my decision to come here. I like the urban atmosphere that UT has as opposed to all the other colleges I visited. Since the time is up I better go down to the basement to study or else I won't make it into the Computer Science major. ",1
"I absolutely hate Mondays they make everything seem to last forever, except for the weekend. minutes seem longer, hours seem longer, the entire day drags without any hope for it to end. But in actuality, if Mondays were obliterated from the week, Tuesdays would simply inherit the mundane tasks of being the first day of the week and the thief of the weekend. weekends are not exactly the most practical approach to leisure activity. the """"fun"""" things in life we wait to do until the weekend and try to cram everything into the two days that can not possibly be accomplished only to start out the new week  on a Monday nonetheless  with drained energy, hangovers, for some, and incredibly lethargic. a better approach would be to evenly space the week out with """"leisure days"""" in between week days. also by random people taking off different leisure days, the maximum enjoyment could be appreciated due to less crowding, fewer lines, less traffic, etc. traffic is far too overrated. the idea of everyone trying to get one place at one time is beyond me . if every one had their own schedules, for instance of everyone could decide for themselves, when their necessary lunch time was instead of the standard 12:00, the roads and restaurants at that time would probably be less crowded, therefore, traffic would decrease. if traffic were lessened everyone would probably be less cranky and agitated. cranky people are just entirely too obnoxious and loud. simply because of their crankiness is everyone else cranky. its like a yawn  once someone else begins to complain about things, you find yourself griping about little nit picky things over which you have no control  perky people are the same way only usually they are responsible for the cranky people being cranky. I guess it all goes  to say that there is such a thing as too much of anything. you can be too cranky and you can be too perky    ",1
"I guess that I should start by telling you where I am. I am in my dorm room at Castilian. I only had one class today, Calculus. I don't really like Calculus that much. But it hasn't been too bad so far. I want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. Tonight is their first football game and they are playing the Astrodome. I got to play in the Astrodome once. It was really cool. At first I was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. But then I realized that I was going to get to play at the UT Stadium and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at UT. My roommate is playing a video game now and I'd really rather be doing that. Not because I dislike this assignment, but because I haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. School and band are taking up a lot of my time. But I think that is good. I like to stay busy. Last year in high school I was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, KEY club, a little student council, and track. I had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. I would like to have that kind of life here. I think that I would like to join a fraternity, Longhorn Singers, a Bible Study group, mock trial, and anything else I can find time for. I like being a part of many different things. That way I can have friends from all over and with many different interests. UT has been very interesting so far. I love the way my schedule works. I am through with my classes today and it is only 12:45 (The day by the way is Friday if anybody is actually reading this). I think that I would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. At least then I wouldn't have written it just see how accurately I type. Anyways, I'm not sure what I should be writing about. Uhhhh. My parents are going to be here tonight. They are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. My mom is really excited. My dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. My mom could careless about the game. All right! Only 3 more minutes. Uhhh. I have a really nice view of the city from my room. It's on the twentyfirst floor. It really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. And it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. I tried the roof but it was locked. I'm really hungry now and that's good because I only have about thirty more seconds to type. Yaady yaady yaady and now I'm done. I am going to go eat. Thank you to whoever has read this. And if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that I can do about it. ",0
"I have so much to do. I need to go get ready for track, but I would really  like to sit down and relax. perhaps go outside and sit by the pool and  catch some rays. I c9ompletly failed my music quiz. I wish I could have  prepared better. I  have been running around and it would feel so nice to just sit down and relax. What am I writing about. This seems so odd to  'sit here and write what I am thinking. I feel like  I should be trying to  keep my typing neat. and worry about spelling/grammar. Oh well. I am very sore. I wish that I didn't work out so hard because now I'm  paying for it. I really need to go read my kinesiology work. I wonder if  the person who reads this what she thinks, She must get so many strange responses. I hope this goes through the email system in time. I have  random thoughts. I guess everyone's thoughts are random. I wonder How Catherine is doing. I really need to call her but I don't have the m money for this month to spend on more long distance calls. It's so weird being away from dad and mom. I almost miss the nagging, but I guess  Kelly's taking their place. She really mad me mad last night. I wish she would be more considerate when getting dressed in the morning and ready for bed at night. The boyfriend thing is getting out of hand. Why doe's so someone want to go around and tell people that her boyfriend is psychotic? I hope Lauren's roommate mobes out so that I can talk about mobing in with Lauren at the end of the semester, but I feel bad leaving Kelly, but if she is going to be this much of a perfectionist and somewhat inconsiderate I have to look out for myself. I hope John is doing well with his Steave  situation. I know that I could help him out, but I don't want to be the know it all little sister. John is so sweet and I don�t' want Steve to  push him around. I think I've been writhing for a long time yep, it's been 20 min. bye. ",0
"Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the University, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From Laurel's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 20 real"""" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. So for every """"real"""" minute, 75 seconds go by. So in a 20 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 25 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 12:01 when I started, and now it is     12:37 and I still have 2 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my """"2"""" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. ",1
"     I enjoy doing writing assignments liek these. You get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind. the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really don't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart. I wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be. Whether I will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class. But among those thought, I also wounder how this semester is going to go. I hope that I am going to be able to do well enough to bring my GPA up so that I am able to get more scholarships fo next year. Man, when I notice what I am thinking about, I notice that I really think about things that may affect me in certain ways. Like doing homework for my classes or whether or not I'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills. But as I take the time to think, I feel that I will be forced to get another job so that I will be able to afford all this new responseablity that I have taken on. Its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time. But right now its hard for me to do anything when all I'm thinking about it how bad I feel right now. Right now I have a stuffed and runny nose, and I am also sore from working out on wensday. It hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy. I think I worked myself out a little too much, I feel that I tried to push myself a little more then I should have since it was my first day working out since last semester. I think I screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break. All I did was work to pay off some of my bills that I acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons. Its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and son't pay attention to the time, time really seems to fly by. Take this assignment for example. I started to write what I was thinking and now that I look at how long I've been writing, I've noticed that I have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it. It merely seems like I've been writing for about 5 minutes. If all the assignments were like this one, I bet pretty much every one would do good, cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time. You can just about write about anything you want, whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest, all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too.

"Right now I am in my friend's Jester dorm to do my writing 1 with her computer. I will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the U. T. campus are always full. It is really annoying when I have to wait to use a computer. I just don't have time to wait, since I have so much homework to do. I feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. People told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. I am still not use to living in the dorm. It is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. I miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. I am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. My leg and arm muscles are aching, since I played basketball and worked out at the Rec Center yesterday. I like the facility there. There is a good variety of things to do. I plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. The Boyz II Men new song called """"The Four Seasons"""" is in my head right now. I enjoy listening to the song. It sounds very sweet and peaceful. The song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at U. T. I am now listening to the movie called """"Space Jam. """" My sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. I saw the movie about half a year ago. I thought it was a very cute movie. It is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. My favorite basketball player, Michael Jordan, is one of the main characters in the movie. I like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. It is so cool when Michael makes a slam dunk. He really does fly a little. I hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. I hope I won't be very nervous when I go into my classes. I have four classes to go to tomorrow! I am really excited about seeing my senior U. T. cousin tomorrow!  ",1
Right now I am wondering how can I fit into college. I am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. Why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. Now my mind is totally blank. I am wondering why I cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. I am I going to be judged by how I write this. Does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. Again I am stopped by the nothingness that I am thinking. Its as if at one moment I am this intelligent individual and the next I am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. As I sit in my dorm writing this I am wondering whether or not I could be doing something else more fun. It is quite lonely in this room. For the most part I think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. Someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who I am. For the most part I have never been in love with a girl. What I want is exactly the opposite. I am ready for a relationship. Now instead of going on about this I am reflecting on what I just said. I am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. But there are also very good things also. I think about how lucky I am to get such a great education from this university. I realize that not many people have this chance. I hope to really discover who I am in the next four years. I think that maybe the reason I have been writing all these negative things is because I am sick. I have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way I think. Ok on to a different topic. I was just watching the road rules on MTV and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. I think this is the perfect case with me. In my family we never really showed any emotions. Not once have I ever told my mom that I love her. Maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. I feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that I have been close to. I don't really open my self up to anybody. All my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. My mom always said that I was shy. Maybe she negatively reinforced why I am so shy. But enough about that. I was just thinking about an amazing experience that I had with my dad last week. I was in my parent's room playing guitar. My dad comes in and starts playing along with me. My dad and I don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. I was happier than ever before. My dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as I played along with him. It was such an amazing experience. Well I think that I have run out of time. ,1
"Working out is stressful. Especially if all I do is arms. Man I am tired. I wish I could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout. I need to go to the bathroom but I can't since I have to right this. I'm glad that I finished the reading assignment over the weekend. Oh my arms are so heavy! I like working out but sometimes it takes a toll. My biceps are bulging and pulsing. Man I wish I could play a game right now. And now I have gone blank a little. Its tough to do this. To think about what one is thinking. I need to move my mouse. There we go. Now I need an arm pad or an extension to my desk. Man I wish I could rationally think sometimes. Or maybe I do. I really need to extend this desk. Now I'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good. Wow, now I'm getting thirsty, but its probably because I just got done working out. It says it is 76 degrees outside. Let me actually check. It is. A shake would taste good right about now. Jester 2nd floor was good today, but not like I had expected it. A lot cheaper though. Its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than Dine in dollars. I've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner. I usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner. So I wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner. It probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then. Who knows and honestly who cares. The room next door to us has a very squeaky door. It slams hard. Ouch my deltoid. I am hungry, or maybe thirsty. I really can't decide right now. Ouch! Wow 11 more minutes. This has kind of gone by fast. I thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment. And I'm so glad I did my readings the weekend before. It allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment. Those 30 seconds went by fast. The people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me. Up till like even 2 am in the morning I can always hear people outside my window. I wonder why they are up so late outside. Usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind. Well I'm going to get something to drink right now. I have had the grape flavor yet so I'm going to see what that's like. Never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one. Going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how I was sore, or maybe just tired. Now I have a coke though. But I need to fill my food void. Some applesauce would be nice. But I do love sour punch straws. Mmmmm. They are so good. Nah ill have applesauce. There are also some grapes too. Green grapes! My favorite. I don't know why but I've never liked red ones or purple. WITHe they call it. My favorite color was purple because I loved the grape flavor so much. Now I've changed my ways because I've learned that purple is a feminine color. Now to get some applesauce. I have to have 2 at a time or its not enough. I'm a klutz. I always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to. I don't know why but I've been wanting to get fatter. Or at least gain wait for a long time now, but I need to eat healthy because I have high cholesterol. I always wanted to gain weight because of football, now I just say it because I always have. When buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible. They are 4oz each. It says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple. Yes! 1 minute! This applesauce is a little watery. I hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it. That really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat. But it goes good with French fries! ",0
"being new in Texas and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that I've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. All my friends knew me and I knew them. They didn't care about my little flaws. My family was there to support me and care about me. now, I'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. At first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. They have this different feelings and thoughts about me. I may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but I am a forgiving person. I do not hold grudges like others. Which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way I talk, the way I dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. I'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. I try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. Maybe I'm scared of what people think about me. maybe I'm nervous and afraid because I'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. People who know about their mood swings and personality. but, I don't. At first I didn't think much about all this stuff. I was having a good time in rush and with all the new people I have met. But, things have changes and I kind of wish I had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, I guess the reason I'm hear is because I wanted to get away. or at least I thought I wanted to get away. one thing I don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people I don' know. they usually end up telling me that I should think better about myself or that what I'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. I tell myself every night that tomorrow I'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, I can't change how I've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but I had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. My mom calls about three times a day. We're pretty close. but, when I was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and I thought I just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. I call her too. I tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. I thought I would be that kind of person, but I was wrong. I can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. I don't' remember the last time I had to work at being someone's friend. I wish I didn't have to write this for so long. I just feel like I'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. I can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. I'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. A couple of years ago I used to cry everyday. About nothing about something it didn't matter. I was going to go see a psychiatrist. I've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if I went. I think for a little while I'd tell me parents that I HAD to go to one. I convinced them. I dot' know what that was all about. just a phase I guess. I'd still like to go to one. I can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. That would be totally crazy. When people tell me their problems I just think about mine and feel bad for myself. I guess I'm self centered or something. I hear people talking in my hall and wish that I could go out there too, but I promised myself that I'd get some work done before I went off to class. I really haven't eaten a lot since I've been here. I skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. Its crazy. My appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. Oh well. When I get home I'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. My boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. I'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, I learned o accept it because I loved him. or at least I thought it was love. I don't' know yet, and I'll probably never know until I find someone who I feel the same way or more about. That hasn't happened yet. okay, times up. ",0
Right now I am thinking that college is pretty tough. I am constantly questioning my ability to do well in college. I want to make my parents proud yet I also want have a good time. I like to party a lot a little too much probaly. I just want to know how much partying is too much. I like to do what makes me feel good and school work does not make me feel good. In fact it stresses me out severely. I wish the world was a little simplier. I wonder if the way our soceighty is good or not. Successful human beings work their asses off to achieve a good living. Is that the way god wanted it or should we live a relaxed life with lots of fun. For me that would be partying spending time on the lake and going hunting and fishing. Is good for humans to work hard and stress there entire life. Maybe stress is the cause of fatal disease like cancer. It seems the more we evolve the more we work and stress things maybe this is leading us into different illnesses. I don't know I don't think one man does know. We could be completly on the wrong track or we could be evolving better than what anybody thought we could. I want finish school and be a successful human being but I would like to know if this is the right thing to be doing. All the human race would say definatly yes but what if we should be living amore relaxed less stressful and more fun life. Doing what makes each person feels good could be the answer. Life just seems funny because people are not robots they could do whatever they want but we choose to go to college and try to be successful. Maybe people just go through all the trouble to make money someday but if you think about it money is created by humans and if every wanted it they could just give it to everyone. All of this might not seem logical but I am human and these are some of the thoughts that go through my head. I going to listen to myself to and not be something I'm not. I want to succeed and make everyone proud but also I am going to have a lot of fun!! ,0
"At this moment I,m really thinking about what I'll be thinking about to make this assignment interesting and if my twenty minutes of thought will be worth reading. I missed dinner again, so my stomach is on my mind. I'm munching as I do this assignment, but I don't think you are suppose to have food around the computer but I don;t know why. What is it with these computers anyway, I've been screwing with mine for three weeks and I can't figure it all out. I hate to ask for help and admit defeat by technology. No where can I find my freaking e-mail to check it. I don't even know if I really have an address because I registereds for it over the computer and don't know if it worked. I figured out why food and computers don't mix. My fingers are starting to stick to the keys. but caramel popcorn is good, better than the food in the dining halls anyway. I like this assignment- I/m getting to vent all of my frustrations and the millions of little thoughts that buzz around in my head all day. I knew tyhat writing is good therapy, but this is already making me feel better too. Now maybe I'll set up my journal on the web and make people pay to read like they pay to watch people going about their daily lives. It must be weird having cameras everywhere like on those shows but I would probably have fun because I'm a camera hog anyway. I should have paid more attention in typing class. I know I'm not using the right """"home keys"""" and my fingers are still sticking everywhere. I hope I don''t have a lot more stuff to do tonight because I'm ready to go to sleep, even though it's barely eight. I feel like calling some of my friends from back home, but I doubt that they are home and studying like I am. My Mom didn't call back from work. She may not have even got the message thyat I called. Mail takes way too long to get here from Dallas. I thought it would be a day or two from there to here, but it's more like five or so. Today's THE eighth and I just now got stuff from tyhe second. Tomorrow is Jenna's birthday. I guess I'll call and sing and act like the goofy big sister. If I was her age zi don''t know if I would want a big sister. I guess it might be neat. I hope my roommate doesn't stay up all night again. I don't know what she does withall herw time. She always studies but she never gets anything done. I don't do much of anything, but I always getstuff done. I guess it's time management skills. I sleep too much. I think my twenty minutes are up, or past where's the submit button?  ",1
"I hear the innumerable conversations buzzing in the background. Why do I constantly attempt to erase my sentences until I get it perfect. I smell nothingness. I should be smelling the moist air of post-raining. But instead, I only hear the faint taps of water breaking. I Love College, by the way. And that weird survey you have us take, pretesting, is the most hilarious thing to experience. That survey is so subjective to what you feel at the current moment. Damn, my fingers are already cramping. Must pop now. It doesn't want to. Let's see, how was my day?  It was long. It was tiring. OU. Damn game. But it turned out to be a nice little long wait with a dear little friend. Nothing beats flirting from 8 am to daytime. Can I say tits. Oh, what the fuck. It feels nice cussing when it is clearly inappropriate to do so for a grade. But, this is what I'm thinking, and to begrudge me for following instructions repudiates the process. Whoa, I like when I talk intellectually. I like when I can say that I like talking intellectually without fear of conceit, because no one is here to judge you other than an anonymous psycho analyzer. That was a long word. Shit, only 8 gone. It feels like a space of time has gone. I miss my adorable niece. She is the absolutely most beautiful human being. I could sincerely cry at the thought of her pure sweet charm. But I won't lest I go deep into a melancholic cheer. Whoa, there I go again. You know, it took me a long time to find the website to do this assignment. There is no emphasis on the paper to reference it's significance. No highlights. No italicizing. I cannot believe how long this experiment is. I want to eat. But I really don't. It's called munchies. And I like food. It's them damn dopamine's. I tell you, for food of course. You better have gotten that play on words, or you're not an astute psychologist. Now I'm talking to someone, which makes me a what?  I really don't know. That's your job. I'm just thinking what it would be like to be on the other end of this letter. This weird letter of nonsensical discussion to a nonexistent second party. Impatience is the motif of this letter. I can't finish it. I enjoy doing this writing but nonetheless want it to end, isn't that contradictory?  That's a rhetorical question. I like psychology. It's particularly fun for a writer/slightly intellectual. I would like to minor in it. Just for the pure knowledge. Sorry, I had to answer my phone. She says, my baby, I love you,"""" and I say, """"I'm typing"""". She goes on asking questions, inconsequential chatting ones. She forgot to eat with her friend. Aw, poor chica. She says she felt like a dildo. Shit just happens, probably too much. ",1
Wow. what an assignment. I can barely type. I hope I will learn to write better. I keep listening to rosie on tv. A soda sounds good. I wonder when I will finally get mail. My parents were supposed to send me some stamps. I bet they got stolen. I wonder if avery will ever write to me. He says that he wrote me a letter like a week ago. Well were is it. I wonder if I will last for 20 minutes. I wonder what Avery and mine relationship will be like while he is on his mission. I feel like a machine right now. I went to the health clinic. That was kind of weird but everyone was nice to me. It is so normal for someone to be sexually active. THey are so surprised to hear they you are a virgin. I was raised right and I actually learned what they taught. Some people have to learn the hard way at the expense of others. Abortion is the worst thing someone can just blow off. just because someone is being stupid and lustful they feel when they get pregnant that their mistakes should not come with the consequences. I wish I could watch Rosie of eat something instead of this. It is kind of fun though. I wonder if Jen is coming down this weekend to visit me. My stupid computer will not ever work. My roommate is nice to let me borrow her computer. I wonder what mandy and Phillip are doing. I have a message from my sister. I think it is Sheila. She has been so helpful. I need to concentrate. I need to read my scriptures. How much longer do I have to write. My fingers are about to fall off. I keep making so many mistakes. AAAHHH! this is frustrating trying to keep up with my thoughts. This sure does help my writing speed. go girl go. I want to call sheila. I wonder if they are cooking or something. I already have a sandwich in the refrigerator from lunch. That is so stupid that they don't allow you to take food out of the cafe. I did. I paid for it. They just want to reap you off. Well I won't let them. I can't think I am thinking too hard. I wonder what avery is doing. I wish I could talk to him. It is driving me almost to the point of worry. I wonder if the mail is here yet. I am so glad this assignment is easy. I wonder what kind of awful things people write. I feel almost sorry for the professors that have to read this. I bet it will take forever. I wonder what kind of experiments I will participate in. My shoulder hurts. I wonder how often I will actually work out. I am so sore. How much longer. YEs 4 minutes. Praise the lord. I said a curse word today and I am not happy with myself. I don't want to get back into that habit. I am not a happy or truly happy person when I curse. It is not a nice thing to do. I wonder what the professors are thinking. I waited for the bus forever today. I thought I was going to die in this heat. My writing is getting worse. I am getting a headache. I wonder what it would be like to have a cat. I like twinkles but cats are so moody. I miss my dog Anya. the cutest thing in the world. I wonder what they are doing at home. I wonder what they are eating. I am hungry. I miss eating with Avery. will he ever write me. Is he too busy. I never heard of that. I am starting to get mad now. he was all worried about me dating other guys and he doesn't even take the effort to buy a stamp and mail it. I wonder if it got lost. I hope I get one soon. I am finally done. ,1
"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this. ",0
"I like to hear music. For some reason, I recently discovered old rock, specifically the group Pink Floyd. Their songs evoke strange feelings of relaxation within me. Why though? I suppose the smoothness of the words accompanied by the awesome guitar. I am reminded of the lyrics """"so do you think you can tell, Heaven and Hell, Blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?. cold comfort for change. how I wish you were here, were just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears, wish you were here. """" --Pink Floyd's song """"Wish You Were Here. """"      I find myself relaxed yet down though. I am disturbed somewhat from the words; but, why am I feeling relaxed. I think it is from the awesome music and pitch of the singer's voice. Their exotic, at least to me, beginning seems to subliminally evoke depth of thinking even though the words may seem stupid. But, the part of the song I enjoy the most is the fishbowl analogy. I think it is ingenious and I am reminded of myself and my inability to find the right girl of my dreams. For some reason, the analogy portion evokes a sort of chivalric ambition within me. I desire a bit of love and romance from a special person that I want to meet. the perfect girl. Someone with the same aspirations as me. A person that when I look into her eyes I find myself lost. Yet, physically, the act of looking into her eyes would have no physical affect to me in the real world. silly.      Anyway, I am aware that Pink Floyd took drugs and were possibly high while writing this song. I do not condone to taking drugs. In fact I dispise drugs. They ruin lives and for what. So you can loose your mind for a couple of minutes and kill yourself. The best way to counter drugs is not to try them at all. Abstinence from drugs and getting drunk is the best things in life, at least I think so. I don't need to get myself drunk at a party to have a good time. I just need to go regularly and I will have an awesome time. I am reminded of a party I went to a few weeks back. This is a disco party where you dance with girls. I went to the party and was dancing and having a good time. Unfortunately, the other guys needed to get drunk to dance. So, they all went outside to get drunk and came back in. They were the biggest loosers I have ever seen in my life. I suppose they don't have enough self esteem to go out and dance with the girls. Unfortunately, I feel that I miss out because I tend to do the right thing. That is why I am rarely invited to parties. In my whole highschool experience, I have only been to two parties. Pathetic huh!     Anyway I look forward to college to meet some nice girls that will like me for being myself, the good guy. This paper will self destruct after you read it! just kiddin' ",1
"  Well, I think that I need to practice working on my team games more. My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. Zendt usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, Travis makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at UT. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or TA or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from Germany or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW ",0
"College isn't at all what I thought it was going to be. MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to John, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him. I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience. I really think that 17 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me. I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at UT. I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here. But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then. I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class. I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah. I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 24/7. And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut. If I wanted John to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, """"mom said you couldn't handle your FR class. Well, just remember that school is your job!""""  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that """"failing"""" side of me. I want to be as invincible as he is. And that's impossible. I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at UT like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me. Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe UT's not for me. Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no. That's not me. There's just something in me that won't let me settle on average         ",1
"     It amazes me that I have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet I wait to do it until the night before the deadline. I don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes I guess I do. I'm really tired. I stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. Then I had to wake up at about seven. I don't even know why I woke up that early. We entered the draw for the OU football tickets and everyone I talked to said to get there early. So I wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. I was pretty irritated when I found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. I must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. I guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. I'm actually not as nervous as I expected to be. I came from a town of 2000, smaller than most people's high schools. Everyone told me that I was going to be sad and cry a lot. Suprisingly I haven't been upset once. Sure I miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. I do miss my boyfriend. He's great. That was pretty hard. I cried more when I left him than my parents. Don't really know what that means. I was just use to seeing him everyday and now I hardly get to talk to him. He's still great though. I hope it all works out okay. I know it will. What's meant to be is meant to be though. I've sort of learned the hard way that I can't decide my own fate, I've tried to change things but they still end up the way I worried they would, but they ended up okay. I guess He does know what he's doing. He's pretty good at it. Yesterday was kind of hard. The September 11th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. I got to go to New York this summer. My mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. Pretty Nice gift. She and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. It was my middle sister Leslie's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. She was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. It was real sad, but we forced her to go. We had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. It was truly amazing.   In my dorm we have a connecting bath. It's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. It took my roomate and I a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. We've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. One of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom. Wierd, but I'm glad we figured it out, it was really starting to get on my nerves.   I've really been getting sick. I think I've been sick since I moved down here. I'm sure it's because I'm in a new setting and I don't sleep near as much as I should, but I guess I'll adjust. I called my doctor and he told me I needed Orange Juice, which wouldn't get me well but it would make me   feel better  , and some sleep. It's hard because I still use my old doctor. He's the only doctor I've ever had. I guess it's that comfort zone thing again. I've lived in the same town, on the same street, with the same neighbors, in the same house. I've had the same friends for eighteen years. It's sort of odd to be gone from everything.    The coolest thing happened to me this past weekend. My boyfriend got me tickets to go to Pat Green so I went home. There was a   get together   before the concert so we went over to one of his friend's house. As I was walking in, this girl was coming out, she just looked at me and smiled, so naturally I smiled back. Then she said,   are you Allison Bruce?   I was like Yeah. She looked at me and said,   I'm Crystal.  I was thinking okay?? then she said   your best friend.  She was my best friend from Kindergarten to Second grade. She had to move to Alaska with her family. Then she moved to a little town, lifeguarded in another town where she met her boy friend Weston, who happens to be one of my friends cousins. It's such a small world. Gary and Weston hang out so he has known her for a while. It's so exciting. ",0
"I'm at my grandmother's house and it's pouring rain. I was supposed to go to this meeting for the Texas Sweethearts but since it's raining I'm not going to go. Even though the social events aren't required its going to bug me all night wondering if the current sweethearts are going to hold it against me. Even though I know other people probably won't go I still feel like I will stick out as not going and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I really don't know. I couldn't be any more tired. I waited in line for 5 in a half hours to get a ticket to the Texas-Ou game. It was so chaotic. It's amazing to see how much people will pay for those tickets. Some people were going as high as $300 for one ticket that they sell for $75. Luckily I got one and I'm so happy. I had to go to work after that and it felt like I had just gone swimming because I was drenched in sweat. I looked so bad and I went in 2 hours late. I thought I was going to get fired. I'm going to stay at my grandma's house since it's  raining, I wonder what I'm going to wear?  Why do I care so much?  People go to school looking ten times worse than me and no one cares, but I can't get myself to go to school without makeup. I wish I wasn't so self-conscious. It's weird, you always think you look fine until it comes someone else's turn to judge you than you get nervous about what they think. Who cares?  That's how I wish I could feel. Even though I wear sweat shorts and t-shirts to school I still care if they match or I wonder if I wore it last week. Why can't I stop caring about what people might think about me?  I bet no one even pays attention to me. I really don't know if I'm vain for thinking that people look at me or insecure because I care if they do. I can't believe my boyfriend hasn't called me yet. I met this girl yesterday at the sweetheart meeting and she seemed so cool. We talked and got along and she drove me to my car and we were going to go to the social together. When I called her though she didn't seem the same she was just like Oh, it's you or I don't know. Maybe I expect to much out of people. It just seemed to me that she was being fake yesterday by the way she was acting towards me today. I can't wait until time is up, but it actually hasn't seemed that long. I didn't really think this would be this easy. I guess you can tell things to a computer and it won't tell you to shutup after you complain to much. I WONDER IF I SHOULD READ FOR MY Class tomorrow?  I feel so exhausted like I haven't slept in days and today wore me out. I feel like I could sleep for three days. Hopefully pretty soon I'll catch on to this whole college thing. I have exactly 45 seconds and I really don't know what to write so I'm just going to say that I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I got a TExas-Ou ticket again because it the best thing that has happened in a while.

"Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my RHE 306 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 10th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later.

"I have a feeling this is going to be a long 20 minutes. I don't even know where to start, and I don't think I really care. oh well. USC plays Florida St. tonight. I hope USC crushes them. I wish I was in California right now. Sunny skies and 70 degrees. My roommate is an idiot. I don't think he thinks before he speaks. He is the clumsiest person I have ever met. what else should I say?  I still feel sick from last night. Too much Beast!!  I've got to get replenished for tonight. Lots of good football and beer. Hopefully some bitches will be here. I smell food in the kitchen. I'm hungry as fuck. All I�ve eaten this morning is Fruity Pebbles. I love Fruity Pebbles. I need more milk from the store. The Cowboys play tomorrow night at 7:00. Dallas is the greatest city in the world. Nobody does it better!!  I can't wait to get home in a month or so. I need to go to the bathroom, but I guess I can hold it in for another 10 minutes. This is a waste of time. I wonder what you people can find out from this stuff. Random thoughts are weird. My eyes hurt. I need to go to the bathroom. It sounds like Tennessee is beating UCLA. I hate UCLA. USC is the shit!!  I need to call my old roommate from USC. I need to eat. This is boring. I wonder how much time I have left. It looks like 10 minutes more. My roommate is obnoxious. He never stops talking and usually says nothing of importance. I think he has some serious problems. Maybe not. The girl next door is hot. I hope she comes over tonight to watch the UT game. She's got a great body. I'm still hungry. I need to get a job. My funds are running a little low. I waste too much money. I hope I win the lottery tonight. I hate this assignment. I guess it's pretty easy though. I better get an A in this class. I hate BA101. It is a pointless class. I need to do my assignment in there. I miss my homies in Dallas. I love kickin' it with them. You can't beat good friends and good beer. I wonder why I like to drink. It makes me feel good at the time, but I feel like shit every morning. I don't even remember when I started to drink in high school. Malt liquor is nasty, but when you're on a budget it hits the spot. Magnum. When I turn 21 I'm going to go nutty. Las Vegas here I come. only 3 more months. I better not fuck up when I turn 21. I need to keep getting good grades. Only 2 more years of this crap. I can't say that I've learned anything significant in college. All it's taught me is that you have to have one to get a job, but from there it is all on your shoulders. I like my summer job. Real world experience is better than book learning. I'm pretty sure they will hire me on after I graduate. I love computers. I guess that's why I'm an MIS major. They have so much power it is unbelievable. I need to eat. When I'm done maybe I�ll order a pizza. My roommate is so loud. I'm gonna yell at his lazy ass. All he does while I'm at school is sleep and watch TV. Rough life. I need to take out the trash. I need to get some beer for tonight. Maybe something ritzy. I need to get a job. I wish all assignments were this easy. Too many classes and not enough time. I need to find a girlfriend. The girl next door has potential. It's Party Time by Tracey Lee is on the radio. It's the jam. I love rap music. The beats are great and that's why I love it. He is the clumsiest person in the world. If my window is broken I will kick his ass. What a fool. It's Party time, whoa yeah it's party time, we havin a party. Time's up. ",0
"I am starting over again. I am real mad. I was about 15 min into my first writing and I clinked on some link and this page transferred to somewhere else and everything was lost. That sucks. That sucks. That Sucks. I do not know what else to write. FRUSTRATION. nothing is more annoying. last year at 4 am in the morning my computer froze. I lost 3 or 4 pages of work for a a research paper that was do the next morning. that was infuriating. maybe almost cried. probably not. about as angry at myself as I have ever been though. bloodied my hand on a wall I was so mad then. I'm not angry enough now to hit anything. it is only twenty minutes and I have done nothing all day. the link I clicked was so stupid. it was in my friends profile. quotes from my calc teacher last year. they weren't funny when I read them. I knew they wouldn't be anyway. but I had to click on the damn link. wish I could get that moment back. about one hundred quotes and not one was funny. the kid who made this list of quotes has way too much time on their hands. not that I don't. it is 4 in the afternoon and the only time I have been out of my dorm is too get food. nothing else so far. that is pretty sad. staring and tvs and computer screen hurts my eyes. throbbing is only word I can think of to describe my feeling. feel like going back to bed. I sleep way too much. winamp. music. weezer. play. el scorcho. god damn you half japanese girls. do it to me every time. all the red heads said you shred the jello and I'm jello baby. two won't talk won't think of me. I'm the epitome. I can't keep up typing the song lyrics. I had it going good for a while. I asked you to go to the green day concert. you said you never heard of them. I'm not going to tey and type lyrics anymore. I'm not in the mood for weezer. stop. change. bela fleck. something anyone can always listen too. no lyrics to tey and type at least. locks of dread. I hear drums and some weird keyboard type instrument. I'm not really sure. definitely a bass and maracas or something of that nature. not important. great song. I feel better. one of few songs that can make me feel better by listening to. I wonder how many words I spelled wrong/typos. go back and check. NO. ha. not that important. this is my stream of conscious. I don't think this is working. would I normally think about these things if I was not trying to record thought. only thing I think I am really thinking about is what I am thinking or what I should think next. maybe not. I confused myself. somehow I went to a page of lines or something. when I went back my time clock started at zero again. I am going to have to estimate my twenty now. why my page went squiggly line. I have no idea. I hate computers, they think they can just do whatever they want. freeze throw pop ups at you, turn off, and a million other things. machines will take over. judgment day is near. no. but terminator 2 could be greatest movie of all time. my occupation is to do what I like - this os my friends away message. a lyric of a song we both think is hilarious. glad to see him with that away message. the stars are bright and big at night - deep in the heart of texas ( clap clap clap) pee wee hermans big adventure. a lot better than big top pee wee. my friend just send me instant message: do you have a pic of prof account. """" he is mad I don't understand him. I'm sorry but I don't. me means a pickaprof. com account. I have never even heard of this. should I have. I have no idea. I guess I don't really care. well after accidentally hitting back my time is messed up again and I am going to say it has been twenty minutes. I wonder if I did this right. were these thoughts too forced. ",0
"I'm planning a trip to South Padre, and I don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). I guess I always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before I do any physical activity during the day. I think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. I enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. Recently, I've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. These sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. It reminds of the Goo Goo Dolls song """"Iris"""" where the singer writes about """"bleeding just to know your alive. """"  The mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. I can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music I'm listening to on the CD player. I think that it's probably still an accurate representation because I don't know  if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. Speaking of music I'm going to play guitar as much as I possibly can now because I've beaten the video game Goldeneye. I'd also like to start writing more. I haven't written in awhile and it's something that I've been missing. The opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which I haven't been taking advantage of lately. I'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. It would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. There are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. In addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. Speaking of acts of creation, I would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. I'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. I hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. I took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. The best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. I took a picture at Mesa Verde of some of the Indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. It's an incredible picture. It's a better picture than I thought I'd ever take. I hope I have the gift of capturing beauty on film. It would be a neat talent to have. ",1
"it's 9:19 right now. I should call home soon. I wonder how my family's doing. how's justin? and joshua? . and mom and dad. oh yeah, retreat. pick up at 7:30 friday night. san antonio.

I'm calm . today's been so tiring. 8:00 calculus. gosh I can't do math early in the morning. mis. when you care about someone more than they care about you, you end up getting hurt. is it really worth it?  why the negative attitude. and yeah, I feel like I'm sinking into that depression that dr. pennebaker talked about the freshman. I believe ti to be true. I can see how most of us would get depressed. the whole new environment. new friends. keeping up with old friends. worrying about how to fit in. about grades, and gpa's and food and getting the freshman fifteen. find a family church. keeping strong in faith and healthy relationships. and to add to that everyone's else's problems. hm. that was a good kiss. I love gary. I feel so blessed with to have him. he is such a selfless and caring and giving guy! I'm glad he got back safely. I wish the ppl in the halls would be quiet. that's what I hate aobut college and ddorm life. there's always SOMEONE in your room or in your hall talking. and I can' t hget started on homesork anymore until like 9:00pm and by the time I finish I get reallly tired causeit's really late. and I wonder why I go to sleep so late. I waste all my time. I went shopping with lucy and josephine yesterday. at momoko. the CUTEST little store . I like my hello kitty towel. it's so cute and the the bracelet. except I wish it wasn't pink. blue's cuter. and yeah. hmmmmm. that other store the chadeau was really nice. I have to go back. gary's wallet is here. I wonder if he realy likes it. andi need to fill out loocie's address page it's cute oo with the """"man toe"""" ppl. my arms are geting tired. why do we talk the way we do? why do we act the way we do? why are we igonorant and proud ppl who are too insecure to let ourtrue selves show. why must we put on an act. I hate karen. but I'm not supposed to. but why oh why is she the way she is? how insensitive!  and how int he world did she and jennifer becom best friends all of a sudden. what an act, I swear. it's all an act. they look so happy when they go arouund hating the world together. I don't know if jennifer is fake around me, either. it's so hard to tell. and I don't like the way she is with gary. I don't like it. I hate it, I hate it. why the fake smile and the fake happy attitude. how fake. and the high pitched voice. and karen. ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. what the heck? she's ugly and she's fat and she's got big buggy eyes and she thinks she's all that . she's all FAKE. I hte fake ppl. I can't' stand them. I hope I am not ever like that to anyone. this stream of consciousness thing is helping me vent. and my arms are getting tired. but hey, I like this. writing whatever I want. and not have anyone read it. lalalala. fudd is cute. so is fergus. and I need a picture in my p[icture frame. and hm. lucy's mirror is turned backwards. and m.

I wish I did too. but my homework. you cnat' really groupd study with. hm. lalala. if I only took philosophy and chemestry this semester, maybe I'd have a class or two with gary and maybe things would be more bearable. or maybenot. cuas jennifer's in that class. and oh. jennifer shue. she doesn't seem very real either. hm. why do people blame others for thing s that are not their fault? that's so stupid? is it a sense of denial? lalala. why can't we accept the truth and accept our weaknesses and admit we are wrong? why must it always be someone else's fault? that's such an immature attitude / I wish I could give them all a lesson. and take away all the ppl they're depending on. and show them that they can't go on living a lie. I like this computer. and the screensaver. and the background. the paperclip is so cute. and josphine's so sweet and lucy. I like it when we can really share and talk and not worry aobut being judged by our own friends. it was never tha tway with akren or jenn or maxine.

"     Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate Kate woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAUTIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of El Paso called Fabens. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 600 student high school!! These 600 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 9 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . """"Cyndi, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!"""" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is Joyce Lynn just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) ",1
"I wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights, yet it stays approximately 69 degrees in my room. I had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm, and I'm generally a hot natured person. The thought of winter coming makes me really excited. I like summer, but it just stays too hot. Maybe I should have gone to college in Colorado or somewhere a lot cooler. I don't know how some people like the hot weather so much. I'm just always hot. I get it from my dad, he is the same way. We are similar in many ways, and we can think the same things, and know what each other is thinking without saying anything. Joseph was another person I could do that with, but I never see him anymore. He should come down and visit, I know he likes it in Austin. I am surprised that I am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me. I don't even live in the same town anymore, I'm 3 and a half hours away, why does it matter. Maybe if I had something or someone to occupy my thoughts, I wouldn't care as much. So far, I have been really disappointed with the college parties I have been to. They are nothing like the ones on TV, which I know TV isn't reality, but it is close (sometimes). I almost wish I hadn't brought my TV, it's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end. I need to be out meeting people, not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool. I would love to be a famous artist, but it's never going to happen, so I might as well make myself as popular as possible here. The more people you know the better off you are. If that's true, I'm in trouble. The friends that I had down here before I moved are still my friends, but I want to find my own group. I feel welcome among my other friends, but I don't feel at home. I have to meet my friends on my own, not just borrow someone else's. The FIG is stupid. When I signed up for it, the only reason I did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up. Now they want us to do things together, and they expect us to all like each other, and want to be friends. There is one girl in there I'd like to get to know, but as far as the rest of them, two thumbs down. I tell myself I'm going to talk to people when I sit next to them in class, but every time I end up convincing myself not to. In my hometown of Boyd, TX, there were about 350 students in my high school, so I knew everyone, and anything they had ever done. Now I'm going to a school of over 50,000 students. No one would even know if I didn't show up for a month. In Boyd, I'd have a search party of parents and friends looking for me. Fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy. I sometimes just watch the clock when I'm bored, like in church. This weekend will be the best one so far. I am preparing myself for being extremely social, and nothing can stop me. Plus, I want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that I find attractive. I'm tired of these people who don't care about their appearances. Dress to impress. I never go out looking worse than I want people to see me as. It's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school, graduating valedictorian, and being like by everyone, to being a fish in the ocean. I am nothing special here. There is nothing that I can do, or that I know that someone doesn't do better, or know more about. That has been a really humbling experience. ",0
"Last night I was almost done and my computer just shut off. I don't really understand why but oh well. I don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. I hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that I can be totally done with mis before tomorrow I think that I am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least I think that Lucy will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally I will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy I still can't believe that I didn't catch mono from angie last year I have a sore throat now I hope that it goes away soon I don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th3ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out I can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy I think I thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult I am so glad that I was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but I know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add/drop though I am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game I am looking forward to it I am glad that billy and I got season tickets so that I don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the OU tickets I doubt that I will end up going to the a and m game  because I bet I will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him I can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him I am getting really hungry I wonder what we will do for dinner I wish that billy and I could get together but we are not on the best terms right now I can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired I hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and Jeff to come over last night sometimes I miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together I am glad that Cindy and eric get to be together again, but I hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in I am kind of getting a little homesick I am anxious to see Lauren's new car I can't believe that she is really turning sixteen I am really afraid for her to drive so I hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice I am anxious to see dads' new office space too I hope that he is a little less stressed I know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but I am glad that Steve a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees I know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but I know that she really is glad that he is not going out Minneapolis a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see Meredith this weekend it is so weird being I'm the same city as her again I wish tat I could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on Wednesday night, but I understand they both still seem pretty immature and I am kind of worried about Meredith and I hope that she is careful. I am glad that she found a date for the date dash I can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you I hope that they all have a fun year and I hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing Ashley this weekend too her room at the house is really nice I think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing I am glad that Lucy and I are going to go on a walk I could really use the exercise I am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow I really need too get back in shape I felt so good about myself last year when I was going to aerobics everyday I need to get back in that mode I don't think that I really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. I seem to not be snacking as much as I did last year which is a very good thing I hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but I think that it will get better I hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard I guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about I think that I might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again I hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but I'm afraid that I would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything I'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it I hope that Amy and Meredith had a good time with their boys this weekend I will go down later and see I have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways I am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun I wonder where Lucy and I will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop I hope that it is not too hot outside when I went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot I think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler I am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building I was so disgusting by the time I got back form class Mondays and Wednesdays are going to be long now that I go from one to five but Tuesdays and Thursdays will be pretty easy except this Tuesday I have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks I wonder why all the good shows start again I can't wait to see the friends season premier and 90210 I am so excited this year should be very good well I am going to stop this now it is now over 20 minutes   ",1
"September 4, 1997   I am not too sure what to write about. I am hungry right now. I have anorexia nervosa, so I not only am constantly thinking about food, I also won't allow myself to eat it when I want it. I am actually in the recovery stages right now. I have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. The only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. That treatment would be out of state (in Arizona) and would last at least 60 days. It doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. The battle is all in my head. It is my mind that will not """"allow"""" me to eat when I am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me I don't need to gain weight, that I am not critically underweight, and that I am physically in good shape. The whole thing is very confusing to me. My psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. I think this class is interesting so far. I have enjoyed reading in the book already because I deal with this stuff on a daily basis. I am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. My psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones I am taking this semester. (I think she's a little partial to the subject myself. )   I have to go see her on Tuesday, which is only 5 days away and I am scared half to death. She scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like I said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat. Right now, she has threatened me by saying I will have to go to the treatment center if I haven't gained 15 pounds by a certain date. That date is coming up in two weeks. I have had this agreement with her since the end of June. I am really very scared because I really do not think I have gained near that much. It's strange how I can think about it realistically and know that I am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me I am fine and don't need to gain. But, as the date comes closer to my appointment, I will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. And still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing. You have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder. You won't want to do it, you'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go. I have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital), but I haven't been able to do much of this by myself. It seems like it isn't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety. Instead, by ignoring it, you get to feel hungry, tired, irritable, you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight, you make your family freak out, you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to college. It seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten, and I can logically see that. My mind is just totally screwed up, which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase. I hope I will make it to the point soon. It's just all too confusing to explain. I am sure everyone thinks I am crazy, but you just can't explain to someone how you feel. I wish there was a cure or some more insight to it. I am interested in what this class has to say about things like this. Maybe I'll get some more insight into it (if that is possible since I live it!)      ",0
"I woke up this morning and I'm thinking. """"Where am I?""""  And then I realize that I'm at A&M. I was so upset last night because I left after class got out at  6:30. Then everything went wrong. The trolley cart fell off the steps and all of my stuff went crashing to the ground. I got in my car and the needle was  practically buried to the red empty sign so I stop to get gas, then I decide that I had better eat something because as soon as I get there everyone will be ready to go out and I will be starving as usual and afterward no one will want to stop and get poor little old me anything to eat. And boy was I right. Audrey says it will only take and hour to an hour and a half to get here. Yeah right. Try two and a half. Someone goes off and gives me the wrong directions that takes me all the way to Hempstead!  I was so mad at myself because I finally make it here, but I don't have directions to Gayle's or Audrey's or their phone numbers. I found Audrey's and Ginger answered which was exactly what I didn't  want to happen. She bothers me. We used to be friends, but then I don't know what happened, it's like all of a sudden, the only thing that she  cared about was who she was around and how much she could be seen doing thins with Natalie and Amy. But now that she's up here all by herself she sure decided that Audrey and Gayle and I were perfect people to be her friends AGAIN. I just don't know I mean that I don't like that I feel that way as far as the fact that she just gets on my nerves, but I don't like being mean. I will tell her how I feel, now, because she doesn't seem to have a problem being rude and snotty to me. I went to Audrey's and I wish I had a house like Gayle or an apartment like Audrey & Ginger. It's nice and filled with a lot more space than my dorm, but then again I kind of like The Woo. Aurora and Raya are so  nice. They take care to notice if I'm upset about something and they talk to  me about it. It just doesn't make me feel any better to know that their mothers don't call them EVERY NIGHT AFTER NINE O'CLOCK JUST BECAUSE THEY JUST HAPPENED TO  GET ONE THOUSAND FREE MINUTES ON THEIR PORTABLE PHONE. It's not that I don't like my mother calling, but she calls all the time and tells me to go to bed of all things. Little did she know that I have stayed up until 3:oo every night since Monday, and last night we got home at 2:30 but didn't go to bed  until 4:30. I don't know what she is thinking because she actually could not believe that people stay up until all hours of the night studying. I had to  let her in on a little secret. All of those nights she thought I was asleep, I wasn't. ",0
"As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. UT is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 9/11/01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 11. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 11 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the United States will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.

"Well, I'm not really sure what types of things I'm supposed to be saying. I miss my boyfriend so much. I hope he has a safe trip home. I hope he doesn't fall asleep. I feel really sleepy myself. I hope I can stay awake for this twenty minutes. Time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. Especially when school work is involved. I wish I was a better typer. It is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. People probably think I'm not a very interesting person. I try to be, but I think I was born to be boring. Be boring and study my life away. I really don't mean to be so studious. I mean I want to do well in school, but I think I'm too caught up in it. Everything makes me nervous. It is so strange because even though I know this isn't going to be """"graded"""", I feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. I miss my family and my friends. I don't think I appreciated them enough when I was home. It is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. It took years to be so close to them, and now I have to start all over. I'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. I wonder if they miss me as much as I miss them. I'm so paranoid. I'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. What if they don't mean """"love"""" in the same way that I do?  I hate being hurt. I like to be in control and be omniscient. I like to have the upper hand with people. Unfortunately,  I think most of the time I'm the vulnerable one. Is that normal?  Probably. If I tell myself that enough I might believe it. Could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. So many songs make that claim. It must be a truly amazing love. I am still in awe when I think about what Jesus did for me and everyone else. He died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. What love!  How sad though to think that not everyone accepts it!  I feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. I feel like there is something I could say to solve it, but I just don't know what. I know I'm not doing everything I could for Christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. I know I can't be perfect, but I try so hard to be. It feels that I come up short a lot in my life. It is so stressful. I'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. I can't stop though. Kale is so wonderful. He would do anything for me. I can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. My parents have to, but he doesn't. It is amazing. ",0
"It seems like everyone has gone home for Labor Day weekend. Lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. We had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. I really don't normally like mashed potatoes but I always just get them anyway. A couple people started playing Coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. Procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. The more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. This dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. At night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. They tend to yell and be extremely loud. Our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. It would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. There are so many more months before the semester is over!  I'm sure it will go quickly though. Twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. I still have to go to Wal-Mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. I'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. Our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. I've been watching way too much of """"The Real World"""" in the past two days. They've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday. This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days. I want to get out of the city next weekend. Maybe I'll go visit some friends at Texas State or go to the lake. I haven't been swimming in really long time. I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool. Maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung. The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. Well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because I'm over half way done. The game on Saturday was really fun. Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. UNT didn't do very well. I almost went there instead of UT just because its close to home and my sisters went there. On the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. I don't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me. Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. I hear a lawnmower outside. I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day. My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. I should trim my fingernails. They keep getting in the way while I'm typing. I haven't seem a movie since I came to Austin. I don't even know where a movie theater is around here. Better yet, I don't know what is playing right now. I haven't seen any previews either. Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. People go out way too much. I can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. I always want to wait for the weekend. I'm sure that will change shortly though. This has been a very long weekend. I  think I'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.      ",0
"What an evening!  I have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now I am in the worst mood. I went with my suitemate to pick up food from Taco Cabana. Everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food. Then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size. Finally, we got our food, and it was right. We drove back to our dorm. The Castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage. I park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to. After ten minutes, I finally got my car in my assigned spot. When we were getting out, she grabbed the food and I grabbed the two drinks. We had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator. FInally, it came and we headed up to our room. I stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as I attempted to unlock my door. As I was doing this, I even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while I opened the door, but I just ignored because I thought I had them. I made it in the door successfully, but as I was going to set them down, I dropped both of them all over my area rug. Irate, I bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and I screamed how much I really wanted a soda since I haven't had one all week!  I knew I had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained. I proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized I had forgotten the detergent. All the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold. When I walked in to the laundry room, I whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as I type this, I can feel the bruise forming. I kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor. I slipped 3 times before making it to the machine. I was so mad by this time that I just decided to wash my rug without any detergent. Now, here I am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events. I get back in my room and the internet is not working!!  I realize that I am so sick of fighting with the Apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm. So now, here I am eating the soggy nachos that I paid 6 bucks for. All I can smell is the food, but now I'm really not hungry. You should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse. Their TV or radio is really loud and I can hear it from here. Oh geez, now they're knocking on my door. """"Is your internet working?""""  It just came back up a few minutes ago is what I told them. For a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst. Now I am thinking about the phone call I just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement. She did not offer me ANY words of advice!  """"Things happen!"""" she said. Wow!  No kidding!!  I don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while I am writing this. I look around my room and all I can see is a big mess!  As of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question!  I'm seeing my WET school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks. WOW!! I think this is the worst mood I've ever been in!  My room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which I have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear. My suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room. It is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that I have back home!  He acts so funny sometimes. He thinks he is so hard to get when I know that when I go down there, he will come right back to me. He's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home. I was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now I am completely set back. Nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that I was supposed to do. My stomach is growling because I am so mad. It gets like this when things go wrong. I HATE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!!  My mom's words are ringing in my ears. """"Things Happen!""""  """"I just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when I talked to you earlier!""""  THen come my suitemate's words. """"Chill out girl!  It's going to be alright!""""  I don't think that will EVER happen at this rate! ",1
"I still feel sleepy because I just got up a few minutes ago. I am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. My computer told me that I misspelled consciousness, but I don't believe it. I have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. I lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so I'm still mad about that since I only found out a little while ago. It makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. The book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and I just lost the last two lectures. Oh well. I am thinking that I am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. The WP still thinks that I can't spell and I'm becoming irritated because I can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. I thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. It's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. I wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. Hot, probably. I can't wait for the cool weather to come. This oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and I love to do stuff outside. Well, that's not true. It doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. I'm thinking that I've already written a lot for only about 9 minutes. Makes you wonder. I am wishing that I had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since I paid for them. I need a better study ethic. I think that I've been putting in about half the studying that I need to, but I haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so I'm not sure whether I should worry yet. I'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. Maybe after a while, I won't feel that way anymore. I'm sure I won't, just look at my sister. And my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. I feel I should include my brother. I worry sometimes how I come off, how other people see me. But other times, I couldn't care less how they see me. I think it's justified, I'm not a hypocrite, I just have an idea of myself and how I want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that I make an effort on them, and with other things, if I don't seem to care, then that is how I want to be seen. I realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what I'm comfortable with. I don't believe in diaries. If I ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then I wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. I would destroy it. Kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. """"Destroy it. """" Like it came from a movie or something. """"Destroy it. """" I'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and I think that I've spent too much time correcting typos. Not that I make a lot of typos, but when I do, I always go back and fix them before I go on with my writing. I'm feeling sleepy again and I think I'll go make some coffee. ",1
"Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea of this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in Yugoslavia, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in Pennsylvania, but had to move here to Austin for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to Austin Community College, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, Troy, is a business major at UT, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the College of Education because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like Troy and Djordje, which is pronounced George, so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named John, whom I have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to Nebraska with him, and his sister Lynnsie, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in Houston at the time, moved to San Antonio when I was in 7th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 3 business majors, then John is a Chemical Engineer also studying at UT, and he, along with me and Troy, who is 22, are all freshman, and Djordje is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since Troy and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 20 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say.

"     ok im not used to this whole typing stream of conciousness stuff. . but i am listening to the green day cd rite now. doookie. its a good cd. but i also smell this crappy banana smell because i broke a pop ice stick thingie. it REEKS in here. i hope i don't have to use correct grammar and punctuation. . cuz i feel that that is a waste of time. thats so funny to say   that   twice. im weird like that. i wonder who's reading this. because its ok. . im just QUIRKY. anyways. my roommate and i went to yoga last nite. it was rather boring. for exercise i need power and movement and upbeat music and stuff. no more yoga. the stretching aspect of it is interesting. but then id rather take a power stretch class for exercise. wow that is a hard word to spell. . did u notice that i am a really slow typer???. . yes this will b a short one to read. my roommate is about to start praying, so we had to turn the music off. but i dislike silence. . but a girls got to do  wut a girl's got to do. yes so im starting to run out of things to say and its only been three minutes. . this is how vapid i am. i will write about how i am liking the college experience. its rather interesting. i wonder if im allowed to cuss. i think i will but i will stay away from the f word. is that ok with u?. . it better b. any how, yes the reason that im loving college life is that im away from my mother. . o boy this is getting me started all rite. its really dusty in here. my roommate is standing over my shoulder not praying tisk tisk. ok back to my mother. yeah she called me yesterday to bitch at me about my cell phone minutes and my credit card. . u know. . i told her i needed more minutes of my cell phone would b my only phone while im here. but nooooo 60 minutes for a whole month during the wkdays is just sposed to b ok for her i guess. . but then I've already been over 30 mins and its only half  way through the month. so she changed it. . FINALLY. this should work out much much better. and then she sed i shouldn't eat lunch or some nonsense. . i guess talking to her frustrates me because for some reason i always start crying when she lectures me. . i have NO CLUE WHY. but that really freaked out my roommate. . shes never seen me like that before. but its ok she was really cool about it and there are more to come she she better get used to it. . this is nice that i live with her. yes. . so the dust is really getting to me, im choking up hairballs all over the place. i went to my RA but she wasn't there, and the front desk said that we have to go downstairs to fill out a maintenance request form. we'll do that when we go have dinner. dinner here at dobie really isnt worth the amount that we pay to stay here. its decent. . but i expected better. my hands are starting to hurt now.

" Today is thursday, September 12th. Yesterday was 9/11. I wasn't too scared about it cause I knew that nothing would happen. It was just kind of sad, I guess. Everytime I turned on the T. V. there was something about it. The sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. By the end of the day, I was just kind of fed up with it. There was this one part that certaintly got my attention. On MTV, they were having this 30 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 9/11. THere was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an Afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. I think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an Muslim, he was a Shikh or something. I mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire Muslim society. I mean there are 1 billion Muslims, they can't all be terrorists. But I don't really blame them, cause I mean even if I was in their places, I would kind of react the same way. Although, I would try not to. But, now things are changing. Not many people hate you just because one is a Muslim. Oh well, enough about this.   I saw this cute chick on 9/11. She was in the biology class. She was just sooo  cute. I should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. Hopefully, i will see her next time.          Today was the draw for the texas-ou game. I didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 80000s, and the tickets were sold out at 79450. This kind of . . I mean only 450 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. I was really disappointed. But i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years.          I am going home this weekend, first time after school started. I am really looking forward to it. Just need a few days away from UT. Its seems like I have been here more than 3 weeks. It should be fun.        I also have test coming up starting next week. Hopefully i will do good. I really need to make as many As as i can. I have to transfer to the school of Business, which is the hardest to get into. Hopefully, i will get in.          After i get done with this, i have to finish my Calculus homework. Its due tomm at 3 in the morning. What kind of time is that. Last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 3 in the afternoon. I didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. I was done with it too. I was sooooooo mad. I guess i learned my lesson though. BUt still, 3 in the morning, whats up with the time.          I had a quiz in Economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. Last week's quiz was a piece of cake. IT was sooo easy. I hate when teacher/sorry professors do this. THey make the first test/quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. Be consistent, you know.         I have 3 minutes left, ummm,  This class is kind of fun. I like Dr. Penebaker, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. But my Economics professor is just as cool, Dr. Hamermesh. Both of the class are fun. Cal and CHemistry are alright, not as much fun.        It is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. UT is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. I guess i am getting used to it though. Well my time is up. It was fun writing this. Its kind of girly though, like a journal.     ",1
"Thins are so different. THere are so many people everywhere. I knew that 51000 people went to this school but i did not realize the implications of having to walk around on campus with every single on of them. I was way excited to move to Austin, I mean. I came from New Braunfels. I miss my friends, I miss the parties, I miss 'drive-bys' and TJs and the movies. I miss Twister and Busdriver and Presidents and Assholes. I got in the hugest fight with my best friend in the entire world. It just seems to me like there are some things that just shouldnt be said. You say things in confidence and expect them to remain in confidence. I only told her because I felt obligated because shes my best friend. its the kind of thing you're supposed to tell a best friend. I never imagined in a thousand years that it would get to everybody and their dog in less than a day. She has never betrayed me like that before. I wonder why she did now. I want to leave this room, but everybody is out. in class or at some meeting or something. I've adjusted much better than I thought I would. Maybe because I was prepared to move on. I miss my friends, but all of us realize that the past was in the past. althought its going to be a helluva party come Homecoming. Thats another thing. I miss my dad, the funny man, the journalist who used words like helluva in his articles. I should miss my mom, I think, but I miss my dad more. quite a bit more. I guess because he never failed me. Aw and my dogs. Jonas is so adorable, hes probably lost without me. Man, I can just imagine how pathetic that sounds. 6th Street! A whole bunch of us are going to 6th street tomorrow night. I have no idea what to wear. Michaels all worried about what I wear. hey, he's in New Braunfels, theres no way he can tell me what to wear. not that i really let him before. hes just not here to watch over me and other guys anymore. Anyway. off to 6th street. I love 6th street. I could just stand there and look at people for hours. People crack me up. We took a picture with Leslie the transvestite the last time we were there. My dad loved it, he'd actually heard of Leslie, the mayoral candidate. I think I got lucky as far as roommates go. Man, my friend ( you know, the one who betrayed me) got the roommate from hell. They go to Baylor, and this girl is so rich. The only problem is that she knows it;  I have never seen a more overbearing, holier than thou attitude. I told her I went to UT and she goes ''Ugh, public schools  . I just about smacked her. I guess the only reason I didnt was because I didnt want to make things awkward for Elizabeth. even if she has gone and made things awkward for me. I think its funny how everyone at first sticks to their own gender. All the girls sit with girls and all the guys sit with guys. I love the girls I've met here, but i think its high time i meet some guys. Im sure Michael would love that. Hes not my boyfriend, though. As my roommate Ana puts it, he's my   significant other  , whatever that means. We really need to go grocery shopping, but both of our cars are in the middle of nowhere (aka. . the other side of hell. I35). It is such a hassle to get to our cars. I think we'd both just as soon starve. As soon as I can get Michael up here, hes taking us shopping. At least he's good for something. I don't think I've ever been so tired in my life. I think its because my sleeping schedule is so irregular. I'll sleep 5 or 6 hours one night and 9 the next. And weekends. man, forget it. Im lucky if I get any sleep at all. Im trying to make the transition with people. You know, that transition between just sitting next to each other in class to hanging out outside of class. Its a little rougher than Id planned. Im just kind of shy, I guess. I have a problem just asking them to hang out. kind of weird. I sat by this incredibly weird guy today in class. He noticed the strangest things about people. He wanted to exchange numbers and such to get up a study group, but we both forgot by the end of class. I can't decide if thats a good thing or not. seems like he would get kind of annoying after a certain amount of time. Oh. . I need to get my printer hooked up. There are so many computer literate guy geniuses I live with that I could ask. cuz I think Im missing some part or something. That doesnt really make any sense because its a brand new printer in a brand new box. What are the chances of my box being the one missing a part? How depressing would that be? Thats just an extra hassle that I don't need. Everything around here is computerized anyway. one of these days Im going to have to print something. Might as well take advantage of these computer geniuses. Ok, watching the clock. . yep.     ",0
"I am writing this for psychology class. I'm glad it accounts for part of our grade because I am nervous about the difficulty of the class, and I know this is a completion grade. I really really want an A, but I read the professors pick-a-prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be. There is so much reading, I do not know how I can keep up with it. There is a good song playing on my computer right now, Calling You"""" by Blue October. The class DJ should play it in our class, even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology, but it does not seem like much of his music does. Yesterday in class, when he walked up there to put on his music, I made a comment like 'oh no, here we go again', and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me. I felt kind of bad. I don't know what psychological value can be obtained from this. I find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this. Now  an Incubus song is playing, its a slower, relaxing type song called """"Echo"""". Everytime I hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me. And for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball. I have no idea why, the song has nothing to do with volleyball. That seems to happen a lot, when I read/hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly, for no apparent reason. There was this book I read by dean koontz, I can't remember the title (I read a lot), and everytime I read it, for some reason I would play the Staind CD in my head. I think its probably because the book is sort of dark/gloomy, and all of Staind's songs are depressing and miserable. I don't know why I like them. So every time I hear a staind song now, it reminds me of that book. I always picture the book cover. I remember it was a really weird book, about these creatures called from some abyss of Hell by some voodoo guy, in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and they hunt this guy and his family no matter where they go. they always get in to the buildings through the ventilation system. I can still picture them hissing and scratching at his kids. Dean Koontz is a pretty good writer like that. he is good at making the strangest things real enough to you that you can picture them. The only thing I don't like about his books is that they are so predictable. This is how they always go: There is always a strong, independent main character, either strongly in love with their spouse or single. The main character also either encounters or owns a playful, intelligent dog. I think dean koontz really likes dogs, usually labs. The main character then comes upon some problem tat he/she can't really help but to fight, because its affecting them in some way. For example, one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him, one lady had a psychologist (haha) using hypnotism to control her and several other people, giving them bizarre fears (hers was of herself, one guy had a look-alike twin of his out to kill him. just weird stuff. So on the way of fixing the problem, the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey, or they fall even more in love with their present spouse. and it ALWAYS ends happy. Therefore I no longer read Dean Koontz books. I know what is going to happen after I have read the first chapter. Now a song called """"I Stay Away"""" by Alice in Chains is playing. the guy across the hall in my dorm downloaded it for me because he said my taste in music needed improving. It is good. Lets see, 3 minutes to go. Dr. Pennebaker keeps mentioning in class that we freshman should be feeling depressed/confused at this point in our lives. it seems like he is trying to make business for the mental health people that he mentioned. I personally am not overwhelmed at all by this college thing. It seems just like high school, for me at least. I was always pretty independent. didn't rely/see my parents much. And you don't really notice the big classes. I still go to bed/wake up at pretty much the same time. we do have a lot more free time here, because your life is not so structured, but I think out of habit I am structuring it myself. 20 minutes are up, goodbye.

"It is hard to put thoughts and feelings into words. The air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. My stomach has felt bad all day, I took Pepto Bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. I'm tired, and it's only 10:00. This house is always so messy, I wish Bryan would help me keep it clean. I'm going to start doing better. The picture of Deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. What am I going to wear tomorrow?  I don't want to have to wake up early. I have to wake up at 9, I guess that isn't that early. I had so much fun at my family reunion. I miss my family even though I just saw them 2 days ago. Some woman on the TV was trying to kill her kid, Kathy Bush wanted to kill her daughter?  The news is so horrible. It's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. I think more people should be executed. The government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. If someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. I can't wait until Christmas. I already know what I'm going to get Bryan and my mom, and my dad. We're going to get my dad a 56 K modem. He's wanted one for a long time. What a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. OH well. I don't want to type for 12 more minutes. I think this assignment is stupid. I don't see the point. Or maybe there is  a point, but I'm not helping because I'm doing it wrong. What does it matter, is anyone really going to read this?  I feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. Oh good, I didn't want Bryan to come over and read this, he left the living room. Our apartment is pretty smalll but I resally like living in austin. Finally, he's going to take out the trash. Only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. Oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 60 years for molesting a child. What makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. I think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. They are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. I think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. I hate democrats. I hate Bill Clinton. I will be so glad when he is no longer our president. I hope Bush runs next year, I know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 7 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 7:30. So should I go to the trig review class or should I go to church?  I think I'll end up leaving early from class so I can make it to church. I need to get my priorities straight. It's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. I want to save peolpe from going to Hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. Now I'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like I""""m some crazy conservative person. Narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. The bible says loud and clear that more people will go to Hell than Heaven. ",1
"     Wow, I haven' sat down and typed for 20 minutes in a long time. I guess we will see how it goes. The first thing on my mind is how great living in an apartment is. I love not having to deal with anyone such as parents, siblings etc. The main benefit to this is being to sleep late. Today I woke up at about 1 p. M. and didn't hear anyone tyring to wake me up like when I am back home. Anyways, life seems to be treating me preety well right now. I still miss my girlfriend, but I try not worry about it. I had become too dependent on her and I think I lost a sense of myself a little bit. Now I have plently of time to find myself again. The football game this week was a waste of time. I left in the second quarter when it was 33-0 because the sun was beating down right on my section and it sucked all energy I had right out of me. But, we won, so I'm not going to complain about that anymore. I just looked at the clock for the first time and its only at 6 minutes. It feels like I've been writing almost 20 m,inutes already. I bet its because I'm still tired. After this I'm going back to sleep for 2 or 3 hours and then I'll wake up and do some laundry. I hate laundry,but I guess it has to be done. I've let it pile up like and idiot and I probaly have 3 or 4 loads to do today. Let's see, the three day weekend was great, and what makes it even better is there's only 4 days of school until the next weekend. The more I think about the nap I'm about to take, the more drowsy I get. I absolutley love naps. There's honestly only a few things better than being able to sleep whenever you fell like it. The best time to take a nap is when you hae nothing to do and need to pass some time. Like after this. I know that's probaly not the best mentality to get the most out of life,but its not the worst. If I need to stay up, its no problem. In fact I'm tempted to just hit finish, go sleep and come back and do this but that would be just plain stupid. My apartment is a mess right now, but I cleaned the other day and my roommate had friends over last night, so its his turn to do some cleaning. I'm looking forward to some cold weather, because I can't stand sweating when I walk to class, which is what has happened about every day. Ok, four more minutes. I could do this all day and I'm sure eventually I would say or at least of something useful or interesting but I don't think its going to happen in the next 4 minutes. It sure as hell didn't happend in the last 16. But that's okay, because someone doing assignment is writing a great paper. In high school we had a english that made us do this kind of writing. Except we had to do it 4 times a week for a month. We were studying transcendenlism(sp?) which I personally is all b. S. Anyway we were supposed to find a quiet place in nature, go there every time a write for 20 minutes. I didn't go to my place one time and made up the entire project the night before. My grade:95. ",0
"Today was a pretty good day. I had only one class and then I had the chance to take a nap. I was so tired. And I am not sure why. I mean I know why, I am up until late on the phone every night with Danny but I should be getting used to that right? I think that after over a year of talking on the phone that late I would be used to it. I miss him so much. I wish he were here with me. It seems like everything that I do or see or hear reminds me of him. Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating in class because I am thinking about him. That is not a good thing; I mean I need to concentrate on my work and my studies. Sometimes I feel guilty because I feel like I miss him more than I miss my family. Is that bad? I mean I feel like it shouldn't be that way. But I love him so much. I constantly wonder if we will end up being together forever. I really think this could be the one. I am really nervous though about even telling my parents about how serious we are. I mean they must suspect something but I know they would never guess exactly how serious we are. I always wished I could tell my parents more than what I do but I never have felt like we have any kind of connection in that respect. It seems like all my good friends have that and I am defiantly jealous about that. I mean Laura, my roommate, has that with her mom. She can tell her mom anything. Why is it that I never felt like I could talk to my mom? I will never do that with my kids, I mean when I have kids I am going to keep that line of communication open. I mean I don't think they want me to be their best friend or anything and that doesn't faze me but I would like to be able to talk to them about the daily gossip at school or the party they went to last weekend or their boy/girl problems. I think that if Danny and I do stay together, he would make a great father. I mean he has the same opinions as me about raising kids and all that. I mean that is a lot of the reason we are so good together. We think alike and we know what the other one is thinking. Something I just thought about is our friends. I like his friends, and they like me. But it seems that some of my good friends just don't think highly of Danny. I mean it is upsetting. Liv makes me mad because she thinks she knows what is going on and she thinks that I could do better, I constantly tell her that she couldn't know. She doesn't know Danny like I do and she doesn't know the type of relationship that Danny and I have. Jill usually is pretty positive about things with Danny and I and so is Laura. Matt it seems never is. But Matt is a whole other story. I don't talk to Matt all the time anymore being that he still is back in San Antonio. One thing I can't stand about Matt is his constant mood changes. It is just so hard for me to deal with that sometimes. And it seems like no matter what happens he always knows what is going on between Danny and me and if he doesn't he asks me and expects that I am just going to tell him. What does he think I am stupid? He can't keep a secret and that bugs me. I mean if I tell a good friend of mine something that I think is personal, I would expect them not to say anything. The problem is that I don't always tell them not to say anything but I would hope being that they are my best friend they would be able to figure that out on their own. I think that is not too much to ask. Just the other day Matt asked what Danny and I did the other night. That is none of his business and I tell him that and he still pries. What is his problem? Sometimes I wonder how Matt and I have stayed friends for so long, and good friends at that. ",0
"My mind has been racing in circles about what to do about my boyfriend. He's coming out here next semester from California. It's going to make everything a lot harder. My parents said that they would stop supporting me when I move in with him. I will have to go to work full time as well as being a full time student. I am willing to work really hard to be with Lamon but I just can't see that this would be the best thing for my future. Or maybe it is. Who really knows. It's hard for me to live without him and I don't want money (or lack of) to ever get in the way of love in my life. That would feel really wrong. I can do it. Ok this is what I believe. I need to take a chance on love, no matter what my parents or anyone says. The responsibility is all left on me though. My interpersonal communications class is really teaching me a lot about our relationship. I love that class. It really intrigues me. This is such a weird stage in my life. I have no idea what comes next. So much change is all happening at once and I don't know where it will all lead to. My life could take so many different paths and it should be interesting to see what happens. I miss my family so much. Especially my little sister. I have this strange fear of loosing my sister. She is so important to me. But this is normal. So why should I even be thinking about loosing her? I think it stems from the fact that my dad lost his sister (also his only sibling) at the age of 21. He hasn't really discussed it with me but I think that the experience of loosing Marsha had such a profound effect on his life. He has always had depression problems but I have never known why. But I have always thought of my dad of not liking his life. And maybe I am afraid of falling into those same things I think of his life. When I think about it realistically, I don't see any particular reason that I would loose Vannie but that's just it. My father didn't see it coming either. Marsh was alone in the house and she started a fire with an iron and she burnt in the fire. So I guess that's what I'm afraid of; that without any warning or sign or anythingshe could just be gone. I love you Vanessa! ",1
"Today is Labor Day. This weekend I went to my family reunion in Noccona, TX. My cousin, Tracey, is recently engaged. I am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, I am a little bit jealous. I know I am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. My brother has been married a little more than four years. When he first married, I did not think too much about it. Now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. My parents have been married 31 years!  I cannot believe it. In today's world where divorce is a commonplace, I am proud of my parents for sticking together. My parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a Yorkie. Her name is Brittnay, and I love her with all of my heart. I was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. I think I miss her more than anyone else, probably because I get to talk to other people on the phone. Brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and I cannot wait until I see her again. College life is so much different than high school. I t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. I really do not feel older. For some reason, I always feel young. When I think about all the petty gossipy things I worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. Once people enter college they change so much. For instance, I have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. However, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. I am really concerned about my grades. I really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. I want to be a child psychologist. Psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. I love children, and I also love helping people. I figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. When I become a mom, I want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. This way, I can spend lots of time with my own children. I also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. If I worked all day, I do not think I would have time. This summer I started cooking, and I found that it is quite enjoyable. It is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. I would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. I also need to find a job. I did not realize how much money college consumes. I feel bad asking my parents for money. Plus, I worked at The Pottery, a local shop in Midland, for a little more than a year, so I am not used to needing money from my parents. My mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. I love my parents/family very dearly. They are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that I have ever known. My family is also very generous. I just hope that I will turn out to be the kind of people they are. ",1
"     Well, I'm here in San Antonio visiting Ty. I love it here. I wish I didn't have to go back to school on monday. UT's fun, but everything reminds me of how alone I am. I feel loved here. Even if there isn't a constant stream of people through the room here, like at UT, I'm entertained and happy. I think that the people coming through my room at the dorm is the only thing keeping me from breaking down and crying. I don't know how I'm going to get through a semester, much less a year, or even 4 years. I don't have depression (at least I don't think so), I think it's just the pressures of school. Everyone says it gets better after the first semester. I hope that happens. On another topic. Ty has downloaded some great guitar music. I love it. I'm going to burn a copy before I go back to Austin. He's working on his homework right now. I never realized how much I would miss him, even though we're only an hour and a half away. He's the only person who I trust enough to be myself around. And he loves me anyways, which is really the part I can't believe. I can't wait until next year when he's at UT with me. I should call my mom sometime. I've been home once, for a few hours, but really I haven't talked to my parents all that much. I guess that's okay, and honestly, I don't miss them much. They got me to a point of being pretty self-sufficient awhile back I think. Sometimes though, it sucks, because i want help, but they won't give it to me. I guess it has made me a stronger person. Ty wants me to help him with his physics homework. I had to remind him that I'm a business major, and that I nearly failed physics in high school. He makes me laugh. He'll make a wonderful engineer someday. So gifted in math and science. I wish I had his math logic. Unfortunately for me, I don't. Calculus is going to KILL me this semester. There are pretty posters on Ty's walls. There's a gorgeous one of saturn and 6 of it's moons. I don't remember, does saturn have more than 6 moons? I really want a Dr. Pepper. I haven't had any caffiene today because there isn't any in this apartment. I guess I'm kind of getting a headache from the lack of caffiene, but I'll live. We're going to go grocery shopping and get food soon. I can't believe it's only been 13 minutes. I've typed a crapload of stuff. As much as I'm dreading / not enjoying school, I do have to say I'm happy with most of my classes. Just getting professors that are fluent in English is quite an accomplishment these days it seems. I wish the cut on my foot would heal up, it really hurts. My favorite color is green. I just realized that I packed all green shirts for this weekend. And I think about half of the shirts I own are some variance on a shade of green. And I don't consciously buy green. analyze that. Well, the roadrunner man is coming this week to give us cable internet in our dorm room, so at least I'll be able to see ty on the webcam from now on. That's actually exciting, because the internet access in my dorm room sucks. Wow, I'm a dork. I think Ty's dorkiness has rubbed off on me. God, I've even started liking STAR TREK. That's probably a sign that I'm officially a nerd. All these girls in my dorm rushed for sororities, and I realized last week that I have nothing in common with them other than we are in the same species. And even that is questionable. They all spew off these greek letters and I'm completely clueless about who or what they're talking about. One of those situations that it's best to just smile and nod. And living on the 26th floor of the dorm is such a pain in the ass. Having to wait a good 10 minutes for an elevator to take you down every morning. Being the last to get off of a crowded un-airconditioned elevator. We have a great view, but I don't think that the hassle is worth it. I need a new stereo to compete with my next-door neighbor's guitar amp. He can't really play guitar very well either, so maybe I should just invest in some good noise blocking headphones. Or earplugs. Earplugs are probably the cheaper option here. oh the joys of dorm life. Time's almost up! blahblahblahblahblahblah ",1
"I miss the way my life used to be a little bit. Everyone else seems to be having a so much fun which is cool and really I'm not having a bad time at all, it's just I feel like I'm missing something in my life up here. I don't have all the close friends around me that I used to which is bothering me in a way. Things will be get better I know it, cuz this is the way I feel at the beginning of my life after a big change happens. I'm kinda irritated at Marissa I guess because she just has it easy with the new people she's met. She always meets boys cus she's so pretty and silly. She's a perfect little blonde. I love her really and I have a good time with her I'm just tired of feeling like she's luckier. I think I like John which is really annoying but it's not my fault he wrote that dumb e-mail. I feel somewhat satisfied that he realized he does like me but can't have me cus I have someone else in my life. This computer is annoying. I hate computers that aren't like the one I have at home and that I know. I miss being able to chat on-line to Amy and steph and everyone else. I wish I could go to Canada just for the hell of it. I'm probably not the girl he would be looking for. he seems like the buff good looking ty0pe that everyone knows. oh well. My stomach keeps making these nasty noises whish gets embarrassing in class. I'm worried about school work. I know that I just need to keep on top of things and I'll be less stressed out and stuff. I just n4ed to get up tomorrow , go to class, then come back and do my Latin and then some math or something . Then do my bio after Latin and go to the discussion. I'll go run those errands and make those phone calls. maybe marissa will do them with me so we can hang. if not I'll call christina or someone. I want to get involved with the Wesly group so I can feel I have somewhere else to belong. I'm getting down, I can tell. I don't know why I can't get pepped again. I guess I shouldn't have gone home this weeke4nd. it made me homesick when I got back. maybe I just need to call someone or talk to a friend. john later or maybe Liz. Brady would be ok too. poor Brady likes me and I feel confused about him. I need to write to shawna or maybe call her too. what a phone bill. I need that cellular if I want to call Liz lots. I hate typing cus I look at the keys a lot. my fingernail looks nasty. I remember that day still and how calm and quiet it was. I miss a lot of stuff. I need to stop being this way, get some sleep and then get up and go about my day. this weekend will be cool at the football game. I just need to be friendly and meet people and stuff. one more minute I guess till I can stop. well, I bet I can stop now.                           ",1

BUT UNTILL THEN, I MUST CONCENTRATE ON EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. ",0
"I really wish that I could get on to the psychology pretesting page to get it over with but I've tried three times and it won't let me on. It's really driving me crazy. I feel like I have so much stuff that I need to get done right know, but if I space it out I can get it done. I need to learn to manage my time a little better. It was easy to do everything at the last minute in high school, but I'm in college know and I need to keep up with my assignments. I'm sure other people are feeling the same as me. If I could get everything done in one day I would feel so relieved, but I have to much to do in one day. My two other friends, live in an apartment, and there so boring. All they do is  sit at home all day and watch TV. I wish that they would go and do something, but if I asked them to do something they would probably do it. But, I just haven't asked. I'm still adjusting to moving. I come from a really small town, of about 2600 people, and I am overwhelmed at the amount of people that are here. I don't know where anything is at and I need to get my driver's license renewed, it has been expired for almost 2 months. One of my other friends goes to Southwestern in Georgetown. She says it is really hard and maybe she will transfer to UT next semester or year. That would be great for me, then I would know someone else here at the school. The chairs in the compurter lab are to close together. You can't move without hitting another chair. They need to spread them out. I want to go out one weekend and do something but I don't know  very many people here and I don't want to impose on anyone and just ask them if I can tag along. They probably would'nt mind. I think I am going to go home this weekend. My mom really gets on my nerves, or she did this past weekend. I  think it was because I was really tired. I really don't like going home because it is really boring and everyone just sits at this store called short stop. What Fun!!!!  I would rather sit at home and watch TV. I want to go and get my hair cut and highlighted and start going to a tanning bed but it always feels like I don't have enough time in the day. I know that I really do I just don't go get it done. I am really tired right know. I went to bed really late last night and had to get up early but I can't take a nap because I need to finish my  homework that I should have already finished. I also have to do my laundry. This chair is really comfortable though. I could fall asleep just sitting here. I hate paying for the copies that I make. I wish I had my own computer in my dorm room so that I wouldn't have to pay for them at all. It's a pain not having your own computer. I had to leave my at home so that my sister could use it if she needed. My parents said I could bring it but I'm in a supplementary room right now and didn't want to. My mailbox doesn't work and neither does our phone jack. I have two roommated, Megan and Maggie. I am supposed to get a check in the mail but it is not here yet and it was mailed on the 23 of August. but I guess it really doesn't matter since I can't get teh mailbox open yeat. I hope that no one else got my check because that would really suck. I could really use the money being here in Austin there is a lot of stuff I could buy. Especialy with all teh stores around here. I really want some khaki pants without the creases in the front and some capri pants. I'm getting tired of doing this but since I have to do it I have to continue writing. Wait, my bad it has been over 20 minutes. I have been writing to long. About 3 minutes to long so I'll be going know. Bye!! ",1
"As I sit here trying to think of something to say, my mind is completely blank. This kind of thing always happens when I am trying to write. I guess the only thing on my mind right now is whether or not I am going to make it at such a big school like UT. I have to walk a lot and the studying is sometimes hard. I am a music major a the time, but I really hate it. I think it is a worthless major. It's too much work for nothing. Music majors don't make ANY money. I think that a big part of going to college is learning how to make money. I guess if I was really devoted to playing the piano money really wouldn't matter to me, but I couldn't see myself sitting on my ass playing the piano the rest of my life. I really want to do something exciting. Another thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that I go to school 16 hours a week and I am only getting credit for 12. That's four hours I am not getting credit for. All of which are of course music classes. I only get 3 hours for a 5 hour Musicianship class and I only get 1 hour for a 3 hour ensemble class. I really like it here, but I miss my friends back home. I think it is going to be weird seeing them again during thanksgiving and Christmas. I want to know how their schools are and if they have been to any good parities or if they have made many friends. One thing about going to UT is that it is hard to make friends here because there are so many people. I  have, though, made friends with many people that I live with along with some people in my classes. I went to a pretty cool concert this weekend. I went with some of my friends that are still in high school. I miss hanging out with them. It was like old times again. I went with my old boyfriend and all of his friends. I was the only girl as always but that's what I'm used to. I guess I have to keep my attention on what I am doing here though. So that I can survive through college. I think my mom is going to be mad because I may have maxed out my phone card, but that is kinda off the subject. My mind wanders like that sometimes. Tamesha is beating up her CD player. She is sitting next to my cursing at her portable CD player. Now she is blowing the dust out of it because she thinks that it might work better if she does that. well my time is up, and just in time too because my mind just went blank again. ",0
"At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, Milan, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows? School is stressful for me. There is so much studying to do and I feel like I have no time to do it. There is time though but I don't like to be alone. And to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. I guess I just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. Hopefully all will work out best. ",0
"Wow, this day has been hectic. I feel relieved that I got the math class I needed, finally. The people in the math dept. (at least sitting at the desk--- the ones I had, unfortunately, to deal with!)  They were so rude and just did things at their own pace as if the students don't have classes or things to do. It was so annoying that the lady wouldn't let me fill out the permission form myself. I mean, I'm in college for God's sake!  I can read and write and understand things pretty well. I think I can fill in the blanks for a unique # myself -- she wouldn't let me take it home since I hadn't decided which exact class of the 6 that I wanted. Then I had to come back the next day and wait in the long line again and deal with the same rude lady. I know their jobs are tedious and boring, but I don't like having to deal with adding and dropping either. You know, I just want to do it on Tex but I can't anymore!  The biggest pain was all the running around I had to do for this and the frustration it gave me!  I had to go to the professor's office find out his hours, then go to his hours the next day, sit in on class, find out that he doesn't accept late assignments and I've already missed 2 because of not being there, then trying to do the homework, getting the book, doing the homework, getting help from a friend, going back to the math dept. to find out if there was an opening in the class which there wasn't, going back at 8am to wait until they decided to open their doors around 8:45, find out the professor I wanted still doesn't have an opening and almost having to go through the whole process again, but the lady finally being nice to me and letting me go into another class and another professor without getting all the stuff signed. She said we were the last 5 people to get in and they had to take us so we didn't (thank G-d) have to go through it again. Now lets just hope I can understand this professor and that maybe he'll let me make up the assignments I've missed. I used to like math, but at the moment I am very ticked off at he entire idea of math because of this whole ordeal. In every other aspect of the university, or in many of them but not really all, I feel like I matter and I am not just my ssn. But dealing with this I feel like I am just being pushed around and can't get what I want. I know I won't always be able to get the classes I want or the times I want, I didn't get exactly what I wanted even registering in the first orientation this summer, but I am definitely lucky in that I got almost what I wanted it seems to work out. I just feel so unimportant because of this math dept. lady who could care less about me and my problem. I really expected her to tell me I had to go through the whole procedure again. Maybe she does have a heart since she didn't make me do it. I don't know. I just feel so, so small and belittled I guess. I don't know how to put it, I just feel bad in some strange way. Other than that problem and a few others that I need to take care of, I am really doing well here. I really feel at home and that I belong here. Coming from Atlanta, GA and moving, I know I'd love it, but I tried not to get my hopes up too high so that if things didn't work exactly as I planned I wouldn't be disappointed. I guess it worked because I do have to deal with these few problems and another big one, but I am still loving it!  I am so glad to be here!  I really feel like I mad the right decision. I'm meeting so many people and some of them I've already become great friends with because they are already caring and helping me with my problems and I'm helping them too. I'm really making some great bonds here!  I feel so loved!  And they don't call me to go out because they feel badly for me or anything, I feel that they genuinely want to hang out with me. Maybe that's just my perception but I really feel that way. and now I'm questioning myself, but I am serious and not just trying to make myself believe that. at least, I think so. But now I think I'm analyzing it all too deeply because I'm thinking -- but what if subconsciously I'm really just making myself believe that. I don't know. But I truly feel that it is a genuine feeling that I have that my friends are true friends for true reasons!  Ok. I think I'll stop here before I analyze every bit of this!   ",1
"     Hi, my name is Heather Hughes. I am 18 years old. I am Catholic, I   like to play the piano, I miss my family, I miss my friends. I do have   alot of friends that came to UT with me, but I didn't really hang out with   them much in high school because I had a boyfriend and seemed to live a   totally different life than they did. They were on the debate team, I was   on the dance team, I joined every organization there was in high school   because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great.  All my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten   percent of the class. My cell phone is ringing now. I really want to pick   it up, but I think it's just my cousin so I'll leave it alone. It kind of   gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my   room number when I told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's   long distance. I still have the same number from back home, so my mom can   call for free. I had a bad dream the other night about my mom. I dreamt   that she had done something really sweet for me,  and I didn't appreciate   it. All I could think about was being with my friends. When I came to   orientation this summer, I hated it! I called my mom every 20 minutes   telling her that I would rather go to Texas Tech or Midland College, the   community college in my hometown. But now that I'm here, I really like it.  I don't miss her as much as I thought I would. I really miss my   exboyfriend. I think I disliked orientation so much because we had just   broken up. We had gone out all through high school, and he's at Tech now.  That's where I really wanted to go. I got in, and into the business school   too, but I really wanted to be in the honors program. I guess I was a   little conceited and believed that I was smarter than the average student   at Tech. Anyway, I had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, I   waited and waited. I received my letter from UT but it didn't mean   anything to me, because I didn't know anything about this college, none of   my friends were going here, and Kit wouldn't be here. But my parents gave   me a deadline and said I had to decide on a college by March 26 or   something. So, I decided to come here. I think mostly because I was upset   that Tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and I also   thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make   it, surely Kit and I can. Well, prom rolled around about 2 to 3 weeks   later, and Kit made prom court. We were both amazed. Because he made   court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and   tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky   football player. So the day of prom rolls around, and Kit callls about 2   to say that the court got a limo. I thought   Great, now we don't have to   worry about transportation!   But then he said there wouldn't be enough   room for the dates, just the court. So I asked him, am I suppossed to go   to prom alone? And he told me to have my parents drive me! I was so upset   becuase later on I found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or   not, and Kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. I   don't know if I'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel.  Everytime I think of my prom, I'll always remember that. He also said   during prom , that I had been acting weird ever since I choose UT. That   made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had   always said, do what's best for you. I didn't know that he thought what   was best for me was him, and not a better education. I miss him so much. I   tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but   everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. That it would be too   hard to have a long distance relationship. I'm really disappointed in him,   this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that I dispise them, and   right before he left for Tech he didn't tell me about it. A week later, I   ran into his parents at Best Buy and his mother told me. Each time he does   something like this I vow this is the last time, I'm through with him, but   I keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and I fall in   love with his memory all over again. I wonder if he's dating anyone yet. I   d ",0
"As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. katie ",1
"I really don't have many thoughts right now, other than the fact that I get to go home this weekend. I really can't wait, and what is this song going on behind me?  Anyway, like I was saying, I get to see Jenny, she's my girlfriend. I miss her so much, but that's okay. I think about her constantly. For example, when I am in classes, I think about her all the time. No offense Dr. P. , but I do!  Anyway, I love this song that's on right now. I really wish these people would quit Instant Messaging me!  I get so tired of hearing my little ding in the back going off telling me someone is there!  Oh well, I guess it's my fault for being so damn friendly. That's okay though. I miss my little sister. I can't wait to see her. She is the most prescious thing to me right now, other than my studies. Who the heck is blaring their music. I am trying to do my work and they think everyone has to hear their damn music. That's okay though. I understand, I like music. Man, there isn't much room on this little space to write for twenty minutes. You should really reconsider and make us write for like ten minutes instead of twenty. That's okay though. I don't mind. It's not like I'm whining or something. Anyway, where is Russel?  He never has this late of a day. Hmm, I wonder. Wow, Britney Spears is so pretty. Just too bad everyone has to dog her because she's successful and they aren't. I hate it when people do that. Oh well, I guess it's what makes the world go round. I don't know, I don't have all of the answers. I guess really no one does. I wonder why Deena decided to talk to me of all people?  That was really weird. She's pretty though. I wouldn't mind getting to know her as a friend. She's really sweet, or so it seems. I love meeting new people. I guess that is why I chose this school, well at least one of my many reasons. I love college. So far, that is. I can't wait to meet more people. Wow, my twenty minutes is almost up. I can't believe it. I really can't wait to go home. I'm not homsick, but I am really wanting to see Jenny. See, there I go again, thinking about her. I can't stop thinking about her. I love her with all of my heart. I would never do anything to hurt her. I know that she knows that and I know that she wouldn't hurt me either. Man, these chairs hurt. I wish I had a cushion for it. That's okay though. I am thristy now. I need some lemonade. I guess I'll have to make some. I'm out. ",0
"ok, ummm, I'm hungry. just got out of psych class and I was hoping to go home, but must turn this writing assignment in before friday. the lie detector presentation was interesting. sadly I started nodding off around the part where dr. pennebaker was talking about dopamine and schizophrenia and parkinsons. I was never completely asleep, just in and out of consciousness. man, my typing skills are really sucky. anyway, ricky's in my head. he is turning 19 on september 24. I always think he and chelsea should be together because chelsea wants it that way. wanted. she says she is over him, but I don't know. I am excited about the garlic toast I'm going to make with andrea's tuna casserole. yes, my roommate is also andrea. she is the more prominent andrea. totally super smart, super pretty, super nice. I could totally jealous. no, envious because she has what I don't have, she is not taking what I used to have. yeah, I could totally envy her, but it's just not so. she is a blessing. so. I need to make a bracelet for jodi. hopefully she is doing ok. and why is kirk still in my head? we weren't even super friends, just very casual acquaintances, but he manages to pop back in my head after three years. great job kirk. actually, I think I like thinking about him. or the idea that I have of him. I don't really know him so I can only entertain the ideas that I have of the hypothetical kirk. and I feel old. and worn out. and everytime I'm close to the edge of the sidewalk and a big bus passes by, I somewhat regret that I didn't fall or stumble into its path. I'm not suicidal, but the drama that comes with saying or writing these things is fun. I could die so easily. if death came right now, I'd go with him. even more so if he was cute. but I have too many people to be responsible to. not just friends and family but everyone who I've told that life is good. where am I going with this? I don't know. but it's more interesting than an itchy foot, no? so biology is making me feel anxious. hard professor, dr. edmiston, but I like it that way because it's like a battle or a contest. you get through, if I get that A, then it's going to be so cool because it's such a hard-ass class. andrea's hardass class is physics, but hers is plan II so it's probably triple the intensity of my biology  class. I'm glad I have something to work for, something to worry about because it was too easy at uta (arligton). I was not' challenged so I slacked off. worked more and got more money, yeah, but wasted time and  money on classes that I liked but weren't going towards nursing. oh well. I tell andrea I feel like a gray crayon here in austin. but I don't feel that all the time, just when I realize how gray I am compared to others. I'm thinking of what to type so this is probably only partial stream-of-consciousness, and not because I have something to hide but I'm better at writing. my thinking and writing speeds are almost the same. or, that's not good, I can slow my thinking to my writing speed but not to my typing speed. and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. an eternal darkness, but I wouldn't know because I'd be asleep. but then if I ever wake up on the other side I'd feel guilty leaving people behind. so that was twenty minutes? yeah, if you want to see more stream-of-consciousness just ask to see my blue notebook. I usually sit front and center and no more than three rows back. but who would care? but it's there. ok, bye! ",1
"Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, Carl, Dylan, Kevin, Crystal, and I went to Lake Georgetown with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and Carl got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about Carl and I talked to Carl about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to Danielle about Buck. Danielle is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. Carl and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in Georgetown. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $9/hr. That should be 23 times more, but I only work 2 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in Georgetown. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. Robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. ",1
"As I sit here at my computer, I can't help but think about everything going on in my life right now. This year has been an incredible time in my life. My senior year in highschool, I was involved in many extracurricular activities. I was one of the head dance team captains, I was the Student Counsil spirit committee chairperson, and I was involved in Key club. I felt I had everything going for me. I had gotten into UT with my best friend. We couldn't believe both of us got in. I remember my best friend got in first and I didn't think I had gotten in. Every time I checked online it said I was still in review. A week later she calls me and says she has some good news. The first thing she said was,""""so what color bed spread do you want to get. """"  I knew right away what she was saying. I was so excited. After that there was no more pressure as to if I had gotten in or not. The pressure now was the fact that in a few months I was going to have to live on my own. It was weird because it would never hit me that I was really going to be in college. Even a week before I was going to leave I still couldn't tell myself I was leaving. The day I got up here was really hot and tiring. Moving stuff up and down the elevators from the parking garage to the dorm, then from the dorm up to my room. The halls were very hot and crowded. We had to wait in a line to even get into the elevator. Once I got all my stuff into my room I now had to unpack it all and organize it all. I remember feeling so disorganized. When I feel disorganized I begin to get upset. Well my parents were being very helpful and understanding. There was a point when I just wanted to cry. After an hour or two my parents left and it was just me and my best friend in our room. I had to move stuff around almost 5 times before I was happy, but even then I did not feel satisfied. Atleast right now I think I can say I am happy about my room. That is after a few shopping trips. This morning was the big football game against Stanford. We had tickets to go but it was just too hot. All I have to do though is look out my window and I can see the whole stadium full of screaming fans. I do have to say I have a wonderful view. While sitting here in my room after a week or two of classes gone by, I feel I am more comfortable. I feel a sense of pride, a sense of independance, and all in all I am now very happy. I have met many intersting people, I love all my classes, and most of all I love UT. The funny thing is that it has finally hit me that I am now in college. Being the oldest in the family made it a little harder leaving, but all my life I have been the one to do everything first. My parents are very proud of me and I can say that I am very proud of myself. ",1
"The first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. My gawd!  Now I am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. Oh, I guess I will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. Now my roommate Brandon is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. Maybe if I ignore him for long enough, he will go away. My glance has caught the sight of the Daily Texan. What a lousy newspaper. It is really short, and the best-written articles are from the Associated Press. That's really pitiful, because the Associated Press writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. But that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. I see that they (ah, the non-descript """"they"""") have created a virus that destroys the AIDS virus in at least some instances. Supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. That brings up the issue of testing on animals. I have mixed feelings about the issue. If only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. And if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. But that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. I saw a Twenty-Twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. They were so intelligent, and so smart. They were depressed, and so sad. Poor babies. Why do I call them babies?  Because that implies that they are poor and innocent. I hate the """"dart"""" board in our dorm room. It is not a true dart board, but one of those Velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. """"Bulls-eye!  Oh, dang it, it fell off. Never mind. """"  That is quite typical. I hate studying!  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I hate to puke!  Just kidding. It's just that I have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now I am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. Needless to say, I could use some improvement in my study habits. And the astronomy is so dry!  What up with that, G-dawg in da' house?  You ask any G-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what I'm sayin', fool?  School tomorrow!  I don't even want to think about it, so I won't. Church went well today. I played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 9:30 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. Oops!  Thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. No, actually, I usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. I must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. Especially since I had to hear three sermons. Two is my limit, and three is just too much. Now I am singing in my head. I cannot stopping """"playing"""" in my head the new version of """"Candle in the Wind"""" that Elton John wrote for Princess Di's funeral. """"It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. """"  I believe it has been twenty minutes, so I'm OUTTA HERE! ",1
"     College? I wonder how it will be? I just started it. It seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but I wonder is it something I will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         This is my first time living away from home and the ones I love and care about it. I feel the necessity to show to my peers that I'm not scared and do not miss home. But in fact i miss my home and my sister who I fought with all times. I don't know why I feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. I can't understand that part of my mind. Is it because I want to fit in the croud? Is it because I want to show others that I'm strong?           On the other hand - I love what I have been experiencing for the past week. I have experienced things I have never before. I never had to do mylaundry myself and now I do that and I find that I like doing it. I have to go to eat myself. At home the plate was always on the dinner. I feel as if I was spoiled at home and that I was given too much. Here I realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. And that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  I have learnt to handle things on my own. At home, if i met someone I didnt like, it was as if  I ignored them but here I realized that it is difficult to ignore 55000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . So far I can say that college has taught me more than I thought it would.          College is not the only thing on my mind. I think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? How will I manage to survive financially? If I will make a good living in the future? I question myself why I think so much about the future and so little about the present. I give undue importance to the future and not to the present. My thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. Things done turn out the way i want them to. I end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          But thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. I question myself if I really do believe in God. My faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. Losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but I coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. But when I lost when my father, I really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person I was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. I decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. But when i lost her at the age of 13, I thought forget God. He doesnt exist. However looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in God. I wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        I used to always think about eating food. But since the past year that it had changed. But i'm back to the way i was. I wonder if I'm a emotional eater? When i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. However when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. I would love to visit a shrink to get to know if I'm a emotional eater. ",1
"well here I am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. I don't like hearing music while I work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. I have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. I don't need music in there screwing things up while I'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as I do. I keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that I neeed or want or should do. but will I ever get to them?  sometimes I think I will never be bored. I would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, """"hey, I have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. """"  that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps I will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that I am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do SOMETHING that my mind tells me should be done. even if I had no school work, even if I finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then I'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated """"projects. """"  to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. I'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. I'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible?  that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streamS of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. I could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy I am, how stressed my life is right now. I could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. I could speak of the things I want in life -- the never ending flow of """"man I want to do that someday""""s. I could gripe. I could gripe about anything and everything. I could turn philosophical. I could question. I could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet I am thinking of them all at once. so how do I transcribe that?  and then I look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. I have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how I love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. I wish I had written more as a kid. I wish I had kept a journal. I did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. I can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why I find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. I wish I had more time. I wish I could make everyone happy. I think I could if I had the time. I'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and I wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. I never get anything done it seems when I start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. I guess I should; it's saturday night. but hell, I went out every night this week it seems. why should I go out this night as well just because it's saturday. I should stay and work. I guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and I said yes. if I hadn't of been waiting for him, then I wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that I need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  I can't stand not to proofread things. I'm such a perfectionist. I had to make sure that word was spelled right. I can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but I guess I will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but I will rebel; I will leave it be. I will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps I should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if I didn't worry so much things would be much easier. I stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until I thought about it again. I guess I should relax in life. I guess I should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. I guess I shouldn't proofread this. I guess I should just hit that submit button. ",1
"well its Sunday night and I'm just chilling in the room. I'm enjoying not having my roommate here. it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone. that's what my roommate does. instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day. I guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever. as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever I want then we have no problems. last night was pretty fun. I went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience. I kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he wasn't that good of a dancer because he couldn't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways. the funnest was on Friday when me and Kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party. we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that I met at camp Texas. he was a counselor that I had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever. I really didn't think anything of it at the time because I thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so I kind of kept my distance. I e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me. he did, which was good. I was hoping he would. I think I kind of like him but I have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so I'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it. and plus he is the guy and I grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so I'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started. maybe that's my problem. when I want something I tend to let it come to me and I just wait around till something happens. maybe I should go after the things I want. speaking of things that I want, I applied to be a Texas lasso. I got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview. I was so excited. I have wanted to join something like this ever since I got to campus. they do everything, from socials to community service. I heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past Friday. he is an iron spike and he suggested I look into it because he thought I would enjoy it. and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe I could be able to hang out with Joe a little more but whatever about that. I really hope I get in to this because I really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that I can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that. I have been recently hanging out with Kayla who is one of the girls I met at orientation. we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now. that's why I want to get involved in something of my own so I wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me. that's not what college is all about. its about having fun and enjoying yourself, not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate. she is trying to get involved though. she signed up for the rowing team so we'll see how that works out. it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat. I'm no one to judge. I have got the music on my computer going and the TV so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while I sit here and type for twenty minutes. I have like five minutes left so that's good because I'm kind of getting tired of typing. tomorrow me, Kayla, and her roommate sheik are going shopping at Barton creek mall! I am very excited about that because I love to shop and I want some big sunglasses. I have seen lots around campus and I want some of my own. I really don't want anything else but u never know once you get going. I'm  a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because I will buy them and add to the collection in my room. its going to be fun whether I get stuff or not because I just love shopping in general that's why my major is retail merchandising. I will get to shop for a major company like mace's or Nordstrom or even tiffany's. that is my dream. I want to have a base office in new York city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company. I want to eventually be head person because I don't like being under someone else's control. but I know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe I will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams. my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but I think not yet. I don't want to miss anything up here. it is so much fun at college!     ",0
"     ok im sitting on my bed. i kind of wish i was at home on my bed. i like my new room a lot, and i like my new bed a lot but i miss home. i am not sad here but i just miss my old way of life and my old setting. i wish i could go back to elementary school. those were the good old days. i love my old neighborhood. i definitely want to send my kids to my elementary school. i miss the scots football games the most. i have been going to them since 5th grade, maybe? i love the atmosphere. everyone is happy and excited it is friday and you get to talk to everyone and its so fun! i like watching my friends play football and the feeling after we won. after i made belles, the scots games became even more fun. i can't explain that feeling, waiting to line up and dance on the field. you are so nervous and anxious and shaking. then the lieutenants bow and you scream for them and then the music starts. we strut out and its such an out-of-body experience. you are standing before thousands of people, and you are smiling so big and bright. not because you have to, but because you want to and you can't help it. i don't think its possible to not smile. then you get ready to dance. and you start dancing and its the best feeling in the world. you feel so weird. and you don't want to mess up. and when the music stops you are so proud. of yourself and of your team. and you stand up and strut out towards the crowd and all the fans are standing and cheering and clapping and smiling and you can't help but smile too. because all the parents are truly amazed. and all the little girls, the little girls that you used to be, are staring at you in awe. they want to be you so badly. because everyone in the community looks up to you. and you represent so much positive energy in the community. and the little boys want your autograph. and they want to date you when they're in high school. you feel like a celebrity. its your moment to shine. your fifteen minutes of fame. its ineffable. i can't describe the feeling, but its the best. i miss those days so much. i would give anything to go back to that. but i cant, and thats what kills me. i can't wait to go back to the scots game in a few weeks. it will be so weird to see my younger friends dancing. to my favorite dance ever. to my first dance on the field. it was the best dance anyone had seen. and the sad thing is, i won't be a part of it. it will be one of those bittersweet moments. i love those moments. i live for those moments. they make you so happy and so sad at the same time. it makes me so happy to reminisce in my favorite days. i don't know how i will feel when i go back to that stadium because it will be so different. most of my friends will be gone. i like my new lifestyle in college. its fine. but i loved what i had. i don't like getting older. im fine with where i was. i feel like my life is going by so fast. i feel like my best days are behind me. i can't believe how fast high school went by. if i could, i would go back and do it all over again. exactly the same way. i would make the same mistakes and everything. just to relive those incredible four years. they werent always fun, but it was a good experience. instead of reliving them, i would like to just watch it all on video. watch everything I've ever done. i miss camp too. i learned everything about life at camp. it makes me so sad to think im not a camper anymore. thats how i know im old. thats how i know my life is going by so fast. camp is pure happiness. all of my favorite things in life are behind me and i don't know what to do about it. i am really enjoying school here. like the classes itself are so interesting and im really enjoying them. but the work is becoming overwhelming. and i don't like   going out   at night. i don't like socializing with superficial people. i feel surrounded by sin. by people who only care about being cool or something. i just love the days when everyone was innocent. and it didnt matter what you did on the weekend. it didnt matter who your friends were as long as you were happy with them. everyone was nice. and on friday nights we would eat dinner at jacks and then go to the scots game. when everything was perfect. and you didnt worry about anything. seriously, stress wasnt an issue. school work was nothing because it was so easy. everything was done for you. you went to soccer practice and you went to school. that was it. it was so simple. did i realize that then? did i thoroughly enjoy it while i was there? or do i just love it looking back on it? i don't know why i like living in the past. but i enjoy dwelling in it. it makes me happy and sad at the same time. my best friend is the same way. she is the best person i know. i don't know how i will survive the next four years without her physically by my side everyday. she is the only person that fully understands me because she is me. she feels the same way. and how many times have we talked about these good old days? the elementary school that we loved so much and the scots games that were the highlight of our weekend. every chance we got. and i could do it again and again with her. even if we repeated the same words. just as long as i got to relive it for those few minutes. i can't believe life in my community is going on without me. i know my home is much quieter now. and i know my mom is longing for the days she walked me to elementary school, probably as much as i am. i wonder if when i leave college in four years ill be longing to go back to the beginning. should i be spending these moments living in the excitement because soon these will be the good old days? i can't see how they are. i like my dorm a lot. i can smell all these flowers. i can't believe im a pi phi. thats how i know im old. if i had chosen anything else, i would be denying my past. my mom is a part of me so thats why i chose what i chose. i have been waiting to be a pi phi for as long as i can remember. only i assumed i would be at smu. did i choose the right school? i didnt really choose because i wasnt ready to go and i don't think im ready to be here ",1
"Boy am I hungry right about now. I sure do miss mom's cooking, even though the whole eighteen years I've been eating it, I thought it was gross. Computer are cool. Internet is awesome. I like being a guinea pig for psychology class. Jester food stinks. Man I really hate it. However, the pizzas okay. Wu tang is cool. I wish I hadn't lost the CD. Racquet ball looks interesting. I want to play intramural Basketball. I wish I had a Car. I wouldn't mind having an S-Class Benz. Is twenty minutes over yet?  Guess not. I love UT. I love                                        Bevo. I don't really miss Houston that much. I could live here forever. Man, I'm hungry. I could go for some fried chicken and biscuits with mashed potatoes and gravy. I wouldn't mind have some Cajun rice with that. I want to go  jogging,  but I have too much too read tonight. I should not have registered  for morning classes. It sucks having to wake up at eight in the morning and  dragging myself to class. Wow it has been exactly ten minutes. Apples are good when they are crunchy and sweet. I miss Houston Radio stations. I can't seem to find a good club station in Austin. I miss the clubs at Houston. However, the ones here in Austin Aren't that bad. Corn dogs at Jester are nasty. So far  my classes have been easy, but I haven't had an exam yet or even a quiz. I  don't know what to expect. I had a weird dream last night. I was at a party and every one who was there was a person I had met but not really was good  friends with. However I did not feel uncomfortable,  I even felt like I had  known them my whole life. I like Cajun rice. Red beans and rice is good too. I feel like getting something to eat. I'm starving. My stomach is telling me  to run to the fridge, but my mind is reminding me that it is just empty. All I have to eat is ice cubes I made last night. Man, I'm starving!!!   ",1
"I am an architecture major. Therefore I do not sleep. Last night I was able to sleep simple because I couldn't go any longer without closing my eyes. I wish that I had the choice to fall asleep and wake up at will. That time would simply stop when my head hit the pillow (or drafting table) so that I wouldn't lose any work time. If this were so, life would be much easier. Without taking time out of my life to shower, eat or sleep I could get everything done. What is the true purpose of bathing anyway? I mean, I do it for the simple fact that I'm told by society that it's necessary for me to be accepted by the general populous. But, in all reality, if we didn't shower none of us would know the difference. I think that's my main complaint about the world in which we live. There is too much US. Why can't it just be I, sometimes? Rather than worry constantly about what Sarah might wear or what Jessica might do with her hair, why can't we just live and experience and BE without the everpresent pressure of impression and attitude. When, I'm inclined to wonder, did everyone begin to care so much about TRYING so damn hard to lose their own individuality. What's the most disgusting, I believe, is that there are those out there who try so hard to find their own that, eventually, even THAT catches on, and then, once again, they become part of a click or group. Here in lies my love and passion for architecture. But, it will also be my crutch, and possibly my ultimate failure. With it I can create and design and people will experience what I'm feeling and they won't be able to say, """"Wow, that's cool, why don't I do that,"""" without enlisting my services. (In a perfect world) They will, however, be able to say """"Wow, that's cool (or awful as the case may be) I want to be in this space. """" On the opposite note, however, the only way I'll be able to express myself through my work will be to appeal to the masses or at least a mass large enough to want to pay me to build my building. So, in order for me to survive and be able to be different and interesting, I will have to find a group of people that are on the same wavelength as I am, which is essentially what I'm trying to avoid. It's a Catch22 and there's no way around it. I suppose I could step to the side and be a Howard Roark of the world and live day by day surviving off the few people who may honor my integrity and desire for design, but, just like everyone else, I crave human contact and acceptance. I am too afraid of myself to be myself. I am too afraid to find out that I don't know what I am or to realize that everything I thought was, I'm really the opposite of and have only been playing a game my entire life, just trying to make an impression. I am so scared that I really am a failure, but somehow I've been lucky. Somehow, I pulled off those SAT's and I pulled off those straight A's, but as soon as I find out who I really am, I'll fall off of this full speed train toward success and end up in a field somewhere surrounded by no one. I don't even want to be successful anymore. I don't even want to be anymore. I just want to experience. I just want to know and think without the pressure of success or failure. I'm not sure what we're all trying for, but I do know that whatever it is, can wait until we've died. ",0
"I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -100 to a 100 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  ",0
"I mean. like I am really burning up. I got this really huge headache. I need some medicine. I wonder what is going on in UT right now?  I wonder if the football team won. I think I am beginning to like it there. It's a lot better than being in Houston now. It's so humid. I enjoy the air in Austin. Well most of it. Like the smog is getting bad up there. Other than that I  like it. I wonder what I can do while I am here. There is like no one here anymore. My whole life is still in UT. Hmm. I wonder who I should go back to UT with? Tai or Paul?  As long as they can fit all my stuff it's all good. I hope I cam get my computer up there soon. I can finally feel I am back in contact with the rest of the world. I hope I get a really awesome computer. I can finally quit begging my roommate to use his computer. Just asking him to use is it is like a big master plan. He is so protective of his computer. But that's ok. once he sees this 'baby' that I got, it's going to be a whole different ball game! rrHahahah. Even though I had some problems with my roommate at first, now things are a little better. I can actually open the door wide open!! What a luxury!! Oh jeez I forgot to do my laundry!!  I better to do before I go back to UT. I'll have stinky clothes everywhere. I got to get some CDs from my friend before I go back to. Free games and software for my computer. Ultimate hook up!.  And food for when I get back to UT. That Jester food can really get to you. I swear sometimes I think they have fillers in there are something. Cause. I can usually eat like a lot. but at Jester. I can eat a hamburger and get full instantly!. But there food. I think is not too healthy. so I find myself going to Gregory gym more often now. I never used to workout in high school cause you had to pay membership just to get in. Good thing Gregory is free as long as you are a student there. I feel healthier now then when I was in high school. I played tennis for high school,  but. I get more satisfaction when I can workout when I want to than. continuously playing. I get burnt out easily that way. ",1
"the reason for that is because of this girl I'm interested in. this relationship has had a lot of problems, but nothing I can really do about it. this girl is someone that my roommate dated last semester. I was with her at the end of the semester and I felt that things were pretty good. now my roommate still likes her and tries to make moves on her. this guy is a real good friend of mine too. because of this I don't want to be serious about this girl. I think she really likes me, but then I feel guilty about what I'm doing. she's the kind of girl that has a lot of guy friends. I went to a club last night and she was there. I was dancing with her and felt bad because my roommate was there also. I felt so bad I sort of pushed her away whenever she got close. during that night she also danced with my roommate and other guys. all those guys danced real close to her which made me made me feel real sad. I don't have the right to be jealous because we really are not together, but emotions are too hard to control. I just wish I could hold her and be with her, but the situation is just too awkward. ",1
"A picture of my girlfriend Bri sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. She is beautiful in many ways. Her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. I'll tell her that next time I talk to her. My cousin Brandon is getting married in October. He is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. When I asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. It should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. It'll be awesome. The wedding will be a lot of fun. I'll dance with Bri and such. And I'll have all my family there. Well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. Too big. 44 first cousins, etc. I remember when my sister got married. Good times. I got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. My uncle (Brandon's dad) took a cool digital picture. My feet are cold. I'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because I don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. David, my roommate is playing guitar. He is playing a solo that we recorded on Trey Davis' recording. We recorded and collaborated with Trey. Good times. I hope he is happy with it. I'll ask him next time I'm in Lake Jackson. Bri is wonderful. I can't wait to see her next month. I hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. It should. And then I'll be able to embrace her like I did this past summer. What an amazing summer, all because I loved her like I should. Honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. We're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. Everything is willing. Everyday I see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. But Bri and I are so far past that. And we both know it. And we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. I love her. I'm proud of that because I know I love better than most if you even call what most do love. David and I are working on a new song. It's going to rock. David, you're distracting me. Half over. 1:19 am. I need to read, but I'll do that tomorrow. He is still playing the guitar. He is asking me musical questions but I am busy. Stream of Consciousness! Yay. Homework. Yahoo for school. Yahoo for me. *shrugs*"""" - billy madison. Great movie. I have it memorized and I recited it in front of Rommy in 7th grade when he challenged that I couldn't recite it. Good times. I wonder how Rommy's doing. He is probably smoking or drinking right now. What an admirable class president. Dustin was student body president. good guy. I'll see him on american idol one of these days. My neck itches and I scratched it. My calves are cold now. *stretching calves*  mmm. cow. Reminds me of steak. Yum. I could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools*  """"Mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime"""" - homer simpson. It would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if I wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. But if I were a local vigilante, I'd hang out on Speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and I'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. """"Bicycle dismount zone, punk!"""" heh. That's be cool. Then they would get up and beat me up. I remember when I use to spend the night at Scott's house back in 6th,7th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. I never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time I saw one of those. they were  ",1
"I have a horrible headache and I don't want to read for my other classes. My mind keeps wandering off into the conversations on the television. My head itches, so I am going to scratch it. I thing I am going to enjoy the business council . I am glad that I got on it I need to be on a organization. I wan to go to Cancun this spring break but my boyfriend wants me to meet his family in Chicago. I really would  rather go to the beach. I am listening to the television again, even though  it's in the other room, and I hate guys who date strippers and then they tell the girls to get out of it. Hey if you liked her as a stripper before then you need to like her the way she is. I am upset that I am missed the MTV music awards because I love music, if I could anything I wanted to I would quite school and pursue a career in the music business, even though it is so saturated. I just noticed that Victoria's Secret is having a huge sale on pajamas, I could really use some. I am noticing that my mind is shifting every direction. It is difficult to write about nothing and stay on a particular topic. If you gave me something to write about I would be able to concentrate, or maybe I just don't realize that my mind wanders so much. Isn't it like every three seconds. Oh this weekend was so cool I went to a foam party and I had a blast. I was up to my face in foam last night. I have never been to one of those before in my life. I probably would go again too. Because everyone was really mellow and just having a good time. Do Do, I am now singing a song in my head and kind of dancing. I was fascinated at dinner today because my roommate's father was telling all about his experiences with scorpions when her was a boy. I was pretty freaked out the whole way home. I kept feeling like something was crawling all over me. It was weird. I am so bored now, You said to be honest so sorry. I want to go shopping for some new winter clothes that always feels really good, I get so excited when I buy stuff and I look good. Well I need to workout first because I have become a little bit more flabby than I would like to be. My eyes are going blurry maybe I need glasses or else I am really tired. ",1
"Sitting here in front of my large window, I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room. Everything feels fresh and clean, except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed. I love warmth any form of it actually. Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold. Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough? My old special boyfriend used to tell me, """"cold hands, warm heart. """" That was something his mother used to say. I guess she had cold hands too. Right now, I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices. I am no way questioning my faith in God, but instead, how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing. For instance, ever since going through rush and pledging, I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to. Basically, my biggest concern is partying and or drinking. For me personally, I feel that alcohol is something that I really don't need to have fun. Then, why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway? After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy, I have done much better. Going to the parties, I merely say, """"No thanks, I'm fine"""" when offered the drink. I am so blessed to have the friendship of Jeff. It's funny how close or connected you can feel to somebody when you've only known them for a couple of months. Some of my friendships that have lasted for years are not nearly as close as the companionship that I am experiencing with Jeff right now. The only problem is that I feel myself really starting to like him. Actually, in reality, deep down I have what they call a """"crush"""" for him ever since we met at the Christian camp that we worked at together. I'm not sure what he thinks he is so incredibly complimentary to me, so I have the suspicion that he may reciprocate some of my feelings. All of our discussions circle around God and Jesus. I have never known anybody so passionate for their believes. Overall, it makes me feel like I should be moving in a different direction, a higher one with my relationship with Christ. This takes me back to the partying scene  What I see there is not glorifying God or His name. Yet, if I can, in some way, glorify His name while I am there, then my actions will coincide with my believes, right? In a way, the only thing I can count on is prayer and patience. It makes me think of Moses and his life in Egypt. By faith and trust in God, Moses and his people passed through the Red Sea. I have faith in my Lord that He will provide me with direction and strength, like he promised to Moses in the Bible. This leads me to think about my education. Sometimes I wonder what my future will be like  What am I going to major in? How many years of college will I attend? Will I have a good job? Will I be married? Will I have children?  the questions are endless and sometimes it can even be entertaining to imagine how things will be. I've noticed that when I think about things like this, I always see the fairy tale side of the story. I see myself with a wonderful education, a highpaying and fun job, an incredible husband, and three cute and perfect kids. This fairytale imagination of mine can lead to bad things or to a lost in the grasp of reality. I remember going into high school coming from a small, private middle school and thinking that I would be playing varsity everything, would have tons of new friends, and I even thought that I would be dating a cuter, older guy. Well, this was not the case. Things happened very differently. I ended up, by the end of my high school career having all of these things, but in a different way. I had six very close girl friends (not tons), I had a special guy in my life (actually a month younger than myself), and I made varsity softball (after two years of working really hard). Yet, looking back, I am so incredibly pleased as to how my life has traveled so far. So, looking ahead, I really must understand that as much as I want to pave the way for myself, that sometimes things happen differently than planned. Yet, there is a reason and there is a plan. Even when negative things occur, there is some kind of positive outcome, whether it's realized the next day or ten years down the road. Bad things are going to happen  it's inevitable, but it's essential to try to look at things in a different light, a ",1
"Hi my name is Brandi and I am writing this assignment, mainly cuz you told me too. Right now I am really tired and worried about my grandfather who happens to be in the hospital right now. I feel stupid writing about absolutely nothing just what I think about and since that is what I was thinking that is what I typed. I am really wondering when this line is going to end cuz it is pretty darn long. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing at the University of ATM right now. I wonder if he misses me or forgot about me. though I know that he didn't forget about me. I mean who would I am an unforgettable person. This apartment/dorm is so terribly hot. I haven't figured out how to work the air conditioner yet. I believe that it is broke, my room mate can't figure it out either. Let's see I have wrote for about 5 whole minutes so far, and this is a lot harder than it sounds. Let's see what can I do this weekend. Hummmm. there is the football game, a party I was invited too, go home (which I don�t see happening), go see my grandfather (which I am not real sure about doing), or study. I believe I will take options one, two, and four. I don�t want to see my grandfather because I hate to be around sad situations. they depress me and I hate to feel sad or depressed. I figure I can make myself that way why put myself into that situation. I love my grandfather but I don�t want to go there. There is also the fact that if I don�t acknowledge it then it might not be true. that is the way I think. If I don�t see it then it doesn't happen. illogical but it works for me. My friend just came over and I let her in she is now washing my dishes, she is one of my best friends and I have known her since kindergarten, but boy can we get on each others nerves. Not kidding because we really do. We have gotten to be like sisters almost especially this past summer and we just were around each other too much. And when we argue it is usually over irrelevant things, or really really stupid things. We also argue over the race issue. she is black and I am white, that is one issue that can really tick me off. I don�t understand how people can be so stupid and childish. Why should we look at race instead of the people. that issue really makes me mad. I really have completely nothing to say at all. I did receive a letter well email from my boyfriend today and it really made me happy. he told me that he missed me. It had been awhile since I have seen him but hopefully he will be able to come see me this weekend on Sunday since there is a STUPID football game on Saturday. I really miss him and wish he was coming here but it makes me happy when I hear from him and see him. I guess since I am a female one of the most lovable things I like to do is hug someone, but only at certain times. cuz when I am sad, it will make me cry in a heartbeat. kind of what happened yesterday. I told my room mate about my granddad and she gave me a hug and I wanted to just cry, but I hate to do that in front of people. Lord have mercy it is HOT. I am about to catch on flames I am soooooo hot. well I have typed for twenty minutes so I am leaving now. I sure am glad cause it is really hard to just wait until your mind has something to say. I mean when you aren't thinking about it you can think all day long but when you are trying to think of something to say you cant do it. never fails. happens to me every time. ",0
"Well right now I have to go to the bathroom but I can't because I'm doing my assignment. I am also very hungry I drank an orange juice for breakfast and I didn't eat much for lunch So now food is on my mind. I have to go to my dorm and read a lot because I haven't read anything for any of my classes including psy (oops! should I have written that!??) I also hope that I get a job at BEVO's on the drag. I would have to work early in the morning but I really need money right now because I am so broke. I feel awful because of all the expenses my mother has to pay. I just want to help out a bit. I need to go exercising I went to the gym yesterday for about 30 minutes and I went walking for about an hour. I am, trying to lose weight for this  dorm function on the 27th all these girls are going to be in these skimpy bathing suits and usually wear a T-shirt over mine. Not this time!! I'm gonna wear a bathing suit without a T-shirt what an accomplishment that will be!! I still have to go to the bathroom. Not real bad it's just  like this nagging pain in my bladder (sorry that's kinda gross!) But that's exactly what I'm thinking! My shoulder hurts. It feels sore, my right one. Not from typing I think It's from walking last night. It was really weird because my fingers got swollen from all the blood rushing into them while I was walking last night. I felt really good because I was getting lots of exercise. I'm also glad because I quit smoking I  never really started but I smoked 1 then 2,3,4,5,6,7!! and that's when I decided that It was a bad habit and  I didn't want to get addicted. There are some many wonderful things to look forward to lung cancer, smoker's hack, bad breath, smelly clothes and emphysema! Besides my mother would kill me before and of those other things got to. My dad smoked and he finally quit. But know he smokes cigars occasionally I told him to quit so now I'm taking my own advice. The minute I finish I going to the bathroom and after that I'm going to go EAT  I'm starving' food, food, I want food. After that I'll do my Lab, study, take a bath and go to bed. I can't wait!! Well I'm not really looking forward to the studying part but that's the reason  I'm here!! Well I've come to the end of my twenty minutes so I guess I'll have to say. . ADIOS!!!  ",1
Is Christina still on the phone? At 9:00 I can finish this and go to the grocery store. It's on. I wish I could have napster on Ethernet. I am really hungry. I wish I could have worked out more today. I should write what I'm talking about. I wish I could type with the right fingers. Why didn't I learn to do that? It was an important step I missed. I think the grocery store is on red river. I wish the door were shut. I wish somebody had emailed me today. Hopefully zac can help me with calculus. I can't remember anything. The teacher didn't even go over it with us. I'm really nervous about the quiz. Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. Wow this really sucks. I have so much to do. It seems like I do nothing during the day. Maybe I should have stayed at the dance thing. Now I'm getting in the flow of typing. This split keyboard sucks for pecking. I wish I knew what to do about track. The phone is ringing. I miss my sister. I am glad I went to the grocery store last night. I hope dad doesn't get mad about the money I'm spending. I can kind of hear Saturday night live. I don't know how Christina concentrates in front of the TV. I had an itch in my nose. I can't wait until after my quiz. The hamburgers will be good at the KA house. I hope I have time to work out today. I think I will never be the size I want to be. Why do I have a rash on my ass? Its good I took a shower last night. I like my tri delt shirt. It seems like the time is passing very slowly. Only seven more minutes. Should I take a nap after this or study math or eat lunch? Ill ask Christina. Maybe she'll eat with me. I like the cafeteria food. I wish everybody treated the help better. Word perfect sucks. I hate the little green and red squigglies. There are worse things I could do. Somebody's knocking at the door. It's probably Elaine. No it's Bita. Is she talking to Greg? Is Christina going to be hungry? Man I hate those squiggly lines! I wonder if I should call the ticket office. I wonder if I'll need to study hard for this class. So far I've only done the pretesting and the writing. It's not even sunny still! That's awesome. I hate the heat. I can't wait until its fall. I love wearing jeans and sweat pants. I can run outside. Maybe then I'll get skinny. Mariah Carrey has a good voice? Where is she? Jessica Simpson sucks. She's ugly too. Her boyfriend is gay. Their relationship seems fake. My relationship is good. Jorde is great. I'm glad he's doing a frat. I hope they don't be hard on him. That is so gay that they do that to guys. I don't get it. Only two more minutes. It doesn't seem like I've written all that much. How are they going to know anyway? I doubt they'll even read that much of it. Bita talks a lot. She always has. That reminds me of Miss A. She never calls me. Why do I have to call everyone? Nobody ever calls me. Juliana emails a lot. I should e mail everyone. I'm much too busy for that. I need to call Dad. I want him to call me right now. At least that guy fixed the Internet. I need to learn to type. Okay I think I can stop now. I still feel like I should write more. Am I a perfectionist? I wonder if we'll learn that in psychology. ,0
"Hello, well I'm writting my stream of consciuness at a friends room because the  ethernet at my room does not function as of yet. So here I am pondering as to what to say. It angers me that I have not been able to log online at my apapartment yet. i intead to call the ethernet people and ge the situtation rectified but as of yet I have not had ample enough time to properly do that. Well, school is pretty cool so far so I don;t have much to complain about, I just ate lunch and suprisingly the school cafeteria food isn't that bad, in fact it sort of is pretty good, they have nice burgers and I always pile on the tabasco like the bastard I am. Twenty minutes is quite a long time, I bet my response here would be more interresting if I was under the influence of some intoxicating something or other, not that I do that sort of thing, but who really cares right?  I seriously doubt anyone is reading this and if you are then I send out a hearty """"hey hey hey"""". Well hey, anyways,b back to the subject at hand wich is nothing except for the monotomous and endless stream of infinity that flows through my veins like a vapor of the serpent that eats tiny little fleas that impend on the consciouness of the letter better red little ant eater. Oh hey, are you following my consciouness?  Or are you thinking that I have lost my mind in the impending fires of infinity that ingulf the ebb and tide of an ocean tht haas not yet come to grips wit hthe reality that condesends to the vast pits of a sub-world burried in the truths of a mad man who has lost all sense of truth,  pity, and denial, opting aptly for the tools osf self destruction and the endless orgasm of the inevitable ghost. So we can fully understand our prophets. who cares?  who cares about the subtle truths that we seek to uncover in I various means of apathetic lethargy?  perhaps we schould quote some famous scholar and then abolish our reason with the tip of a hat a cigar made from banana leaves?  Where have our morals gone today?  Where is the profanity in a language that adulates the adoration of adulturation and the abominal abortion of the spirit of the infite wisdom burried in the truths of an incoharant lunatic rambling at the sppeed of a jack rabbit copulating wit hthe pourpouse of my reasoning. Well I ponder if it's been twent ymintues yet, and I think that it indeed has so I must depart with a hearty hand shake and in the words of the infinite wisdom of the great and all mighty pooh bear, say ta-ta for now. take it easy and such. where is the party in the silent room?  Indeed if you know won't you please come and joing me. All is ripe for the tacking. So long for now. ",1
"I'm sitting in the library at 4:45am once again. Now I'm wondering why it is that I insist on pulling these all nighters constantly, and doing it without proper sleep or rest. Oh well. It's really cold in here, but it always is. I really shouldn't be getting distracted by the temperature in here. I should be more worried about the EE test that I have to take this semester or the CS class that I have to pass, although neither of them are weighing on my mind with the magnitude that they should. I'm begging to miss surfing again. I thought that the three weeks home this summer would help cure me of my love of the ocean, but it didn't. It never does. I need to be playing guitar more also. I've let it slip quite a bit here lately. I know the reason for that, I've let myself get too distracted with the girls around me. I allow them too much power over my life, and my actions. But that's ok because I'm done with all of that. I'm really going to try to cut my ties to all of what is negative in my life. Well at least as far as my friends go. I've begun to realize more and more how much people use me. The funny part of it is they all think that they're getting away with something, when in fact I'm quite aware of what is going on around me and what is happening to me. I guess I just give people to much damn credit. That's another thing I'm over. Despite how much I say I don't want those people in my life I know that I crave them being there due to my own insecurities and my need to have other gay people around me. But why the hell to I feel the need to have those gay people around me? They end up making me feel more ostracized than accepted. I'll never become what they see as normal. For that matter, I don't want to become that. I don't want to go out and sleep around, and do the drugs and all that other crap. It just occurred to me that who ever reads this will think that I'm writing this solely to seem like some good kid, yeah right. I'm not, but then again, they'll never know that. I find this assignment odd. I'd love to read what other students write, and more importantly I'd love to know how much of it is truly stream of conscious writing and how much of it is just premeditated butt kissing. Once again something I'm sure I'll never know. But sure enough something I'll ponder for at least a little while. I'm sure I'll be able to use that as an intricate procrastination method when I should be studying for one of the many classes that I'm taking this semester which are surely going to kill me. Man, I meant to pay my phone bill today. I've got to do that tomorrow. My credit is going to be so screwed. I've screwed up so bad as far as money goes this past few years, well actually it's been this past year. I just don't even like to think about money. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I think about it. If I were the least bit intelligent I would learn to budget or even better yet keep a check book like a normal person but oh no. God, there's that damn word again, """"normal"""". I've come to despise that word. It seems like everywhere I turn I'm being bombarded with it, and what's worse is the fact that no matter who's throwing it at me I'm not fitting it. I just hate that word. Who's right is it to decided weather or not I'm normal. Who gets to decide what is normal. I think that's what I want to be when I grow up. the one who decides what's normal. No I don't want to do that, changed my mind. I don't want to put any more labels into this world than already exists. Speaking of things I've got to do soon, I need to change my oil. Since Chris and I drove to Dallas yesterday that put me nearly 200 miles where I was supposed to change it. I used to never let it get that far over. School has become such a distraction to my life. I know it's bad when my parents keep telling me that I'm working too hard and taking school too serious. I guess it all goes back to working hard at school as being a way of running away from everything else. It's just so much easier to come up to the library and work, and at least do something productive, rather than sitting around and dwelling over the drama and crap that exits in my life. Most of which I can't do a damn thing about. That's another thing I need to work on accepting what I can change and what I can't. I seem to get it in my mind that I solve the problems of the world. Before I do that I need to get my own life straightened out. I can't even get a date, and I think I can give the world leaders advice as to how to prevent war. Ok, sure Heidi, you can't even have a relationship with someone your own age who speaks you're language and you think you're going to go and create world peace with people who don't even speak English, sure. Talking about impossible problems I wonder when my new computer will get here. I really need to start on my program for my CS class. There's another thing that just makes me sick every time I think about. To think that I've got to get an A in that class to go to Germany next year just scares the crap out of me. Not much scares me. A lot of things will worry me. I worry too much. I try to deny it when other people tell me that, because common what the hell do they know about me? Well, Kid, a lot. I swear I get worried about the kid who's lonely their first year at college on the AT&T commercials. Alright that's a little overboard again, but oh well. I need to go buy some new study CD's this week. NO, NO. No more spending money. Where do I think I'm going to get this money from? DO I think it's just going to come to me when I'm not working or anything? And I know damn well that as soon as I get that new computer all I'm going to want to do is buy DVDs and programs for that crap. That's the last thing I needed to get on my laptop was a DVD player. That's just great. Now I can come to the Library to study and sit and watch a movie. And knowing me, that's something I would do just to show off my new toy. And I know that's part of the reason that I spent the extra money what to say that I've got a laptop with a DVD player on it. I say I'm not worried by what other people think, and I really don't think I am, but I sure as hell love it when they think I'm cool. Or even better yet, when they envy me. I think I get off on the whole envy thing because it makes me feel as though if there is a reason for people to envy me then my life isn't as messed up and pathetic as it seems most of the time. It's really not that bad, I just think I need to be on antidepressants. That's really common with the whole ADHD thing, but then again the whole ADHD thing brings in a whole new question of who has it, how to diagnose etc. It's really scary to see that these are the things that I think about when I've got free time to think. I really need to find a hobby of some sort. I mean I have one, I have several actually, but it's not really things I just sit and think about. Well music is, but I'm not going to sit here and write songs. I'm not in the songwriting mood. Although, if I didn't have so much work to do I wouldn't mind working on my comic book. I'm getting started on another character. I've got enough male characters the next one will be a female. Not quite sure any of the particulars yet. I'm sure it will be something along the line of goodlooking, selfsufficient, muscular, you know all of those things that most people don't relate to being in package deal with women. Ah, I like this song. It always reminds me of home. I miss my parents right now. I don't get home sick often but when I do it really hits me hard. It's hard to believe that I've been gone from home for two years now. It just doesn't seem real. So much has happened. This past year has changed my life without a doubt. I mean I never thought I would get the courage to tell my parents that I'm gay, or for that matter I never thought that I would get the courage to tell my sisters. What blows my mind is the fact that now I can sit and talk about it to my mom and dad more openly than I ever saw my sisters do with their straight relationships. Family, man. Another think that hurts to think about. I wish we could do with all the crap. I wish there wasn't the stupid petty shit that there is. I'd really love to know who is Waxahachie told my sisters that I'm gay. I mean someone else has to know from the way the whole town knows. I wish I knew that Sonja, my own flesh and blood would stand up for me, but then again I know that's never going to happen. I've sat though too many gaybashing sessions with her. That's another thing that just amazes me, how the same people can raise three kids, it what seems to be the exact same way, and they can turn out so different. Speaking of raising kids, I need to decide about grandpa's funeral. I really really don't want to give the eulogy. I had so much contempt for this man not 6 months ago, but then again I know that I should because it's one of his last wishes. Why should I honor his last wishes though? What has he done for me? That's wrong of me to say. I know that, and I know that in the end no matter how much I don't want to do it, I'll end up speaking at his funeral. That's right I need to call them tomorrow and see what the Dr. said, then I need to call the Dr. and see what they have to say. Never can get the same story from both. ",1
"This is a little confusing. I am not quite sure what I ahould be doing. Oh well I guess it really doesn't matter. I am glad I am going home this weekend. I really miss everyone. It will cool to just hang out at home and not have to worry about what I should be doing right now. College is a lot of reading. I am actually learning a lot more than I learned in a whole semester of high school. I enjoy that but it does get to be a bit tedious, expecially science. Well iguess it can only get better form here on. I was confused about a lot of stuff, like what to do with all of my spare time. I was going to have a job but then they took away my work study and now I have too much free time. That's okay because I didn't really want to work anyway. But I can't believe the lady never called be back. Tha t is just rude etiquette. Oh well. There's nothing I can do about it anyway. I wonder why we are shunned by our dorm mates. I guess we weren't social enough or something. We tried. But at least they aren't outright mean to us, they are just very cordial and you know what that means. Doh!  Oh well. It's fun rooming with Ashley, I just don't know why she chooses to bother me on purpose sometimes. I think she can be very immature at times. But I would rather put up with that than with someone who barely talks or just doesn't like me for whatever reason. I don't want to go to all those meetings tonight that sucks!  Maybe I just won't go. But I probably will. I can't shirk my responsibilites just because I don't want to. Maybe some people need to do that once in a while though. I wonder what Plato would have to say about that. His books are cool. I like the idea of Socrates just sitting around waiting to confuse people. If you make people question their own values, then what do you consider as your values?  I don't know. LThat's just odd. ",1
"Okay, here we go. I am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. I don't know how I can do this considering that I type pretty fast and also I am in the UGL and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that I type. Oh well, no one seems to be listening. I am really tired right now and all I can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE MINUTE! I can't do this for that long. I have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm I had a fun time last night. I got in at 6 in the morning. IF only my mother could see me now. that's the latest I've ever gotten in. am I typing loud? I don't want to do this anymore. I am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that I am typing. bored bored bored bored. I miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in Barnes and noble I was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and I really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow I held it back. hell right now I want to cry. I really miss all of my Dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. I guess it's inevitable, though. I mean I've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but I never thought that it really would be this hard. I'm living on my own. I am my own mother now. That's pretty damn scary! I think I'm responsible though. I've always been able to manage my time wisely. Even my mom agrees with that. IT'S ONLY BEEN 3 MINUTES. or 4 maybe. I really like this guy I met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. I'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. I hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. I'm really paranoid right now. I don't want him to see that I'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks I'm stalking him anyway. I'm really not. I think I am inventing things in my head. I do that a lot. I can't believe I'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. Well, hopefully not. I mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. YIKES! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least I am assuming that it is. So, with that in mind I really am open to write whatever the hell I want to write. This is for my benefit, in essence. Like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. Not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! I really like that guy. I hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe Tuesday. Hell, I'm sick of waiting around for this guy. I always do this. I cling on so fast to people I'm interested in even after just meeting them. It's like I have a onetrack mind and it's all I can think about. That's pretty scary, huh? Wow I just scrolled up and I've written a lot. A lot of really boring stuff too. He probably won't call tomorrow. Who am I kidding? I can't keep doing this to myself. It's really unhealthy. I just want to cry after realizing this. It's such a horrible thing. I am putting this guy up on a pedestal  is that how you spell it?  and like if he messes up just a little bit, then I think that he hates me and I'm just this horrible person. God I say the stupidest things around him sometimes. I'm so concerned with trying to impress him that I just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but I am again blowing it out of proportion. Who am I kidding, I need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. Like everyone I meet, I hold off on just for that rare chance that I might get to date this guy. I am a weird person. I am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. It feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. Whoa that's scary. I love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. NOT REALLY. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. I feel like each letter I type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. Wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. How did that go so fast? What did I write about? I can't even remember. I really don't want to look back at what I wrote either because I'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but I'm sure I will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, I envy your patience. until next time. That is all. ",1
" The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss Richie so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.   ",0
"I really wish I didn't have to do this. Actually I don't want to do homework at all. I don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing. I actually didn't even start reading any of my books until I knew I had to for an Economics quiz. This weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and I really didn't. I did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class I'm taking. I am really disappointed that I didn't get to see my friends in Arlington, but I did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice. I miss them but I love college and Austin. I also hope that I get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better. Unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so I don't mind that. Cat's here and she's talking. Jessica is here and she's messing with channels. Earlier we watched the U. S Open after she got home and we watched Justine Henin-Hardenne lose. Yay. Oh, I really have to sneeze and I'm kind of thirsty. I really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco. One time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke. Today I talked to Alicia's mom more that I talked to her. I actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on. I hope she is doing ok at UNT because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when I have talked to her. I talked to Amanda today too and now I'm so frazzled and distracted. Cat and Jessica are loud and I can't even complete a train of thought. It's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer. Is William Faulkner the dean? I don't know but I'm so excited about UT. Jessica has a lot of clothes, food, and books and I think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff. Today I bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to Kinsolving. Later, I tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and Jess made fun of me because I couldn't put it on. I just told Cat that she couldn't have a Kleenex and it was pretty funny. I really like college and all the people I have met so far. They are so nice and I love them.  ",1
"Right now at this moment I am feeling a little anxiety. I tell myself that this is normal, being a first year student I should feel this way. But the thought does not comfort me. For some reason I feel I am the only one who is going through this right now. I don't feel anxiety all the time though, when I run into friends or go to class it all disappears. My only explanation is that I am comfortable with routine. I hate routine. There is nothing exciting about it, it's just boring. There's no risk in routine or adventure, only security. Maybe that's why I feel so much better when I have work to do or a class to catch. I hope I grow out of this and become more relaxed. The way I see it is that the only way I'm ever going to grow out of this is to get use to the different lifestyle by gaining confidence over time. You can only gain courage towards something as you do it. All I have to do is get over that first hurdle, just do it and not think about the situation for too long. That's my problem; I worry about the future way too much. Worrying is a waste of time and I know that from experience. Half the things I have worried about here at school have turned out to be nothing. But for some reason I still worry, I worry a lot. I have noticed that nothing ever turns out the way you plan in your head. So if I plan on worrying, why do I actually worry? I know there's a good chance it won't happen because I thought of it. I will never enjoy life like this. If this keeps up I'm going to have a problem. I want to go out into the world and totally change something. But I know for sure that won't happen if I don't grow up!. ",1
"I am so stressed out right now with all these school stuff. Today I was so frustrated with my course schedule because I needed a fine arts credit. At the beginning, I signed up for art history, but I just found out that the class didn't work out for me. I didn't want something that hard to deal with since I am not even majoring in art. Therefore, I decided to try the music department. I called in, and the lady who worked at the office told me that the music appreciation class was still opened. She told me to go all the way to the building MRH just to fill out the green card in order to add the class. So, I decided to drop my art history class right away. In the afternoon, I rushed over there. By the time when I got there, one of the lady told me that I needed to talk to the professor first before I could fill out the green card. Plus, the time of the class she offered me interfered with my original schedule. I was so upset about this when I left the building because I really needed one more class in order to be fill up my hours. When I got back to my dorm, I immediately called my college of education for help. The guy told me to go to see the advisors in the next morning. He also told me not to worry too much today about it. I knew I shouldn't drop my art history class that quickly. I should have waited to see if I could be added to another class. Right now, I consider to take piano as my fine arts credit during the next semester because I have a little knowledge with piano but I am required to sign up on the waiting list first. The class can only fill up 15 students. Instead of taking the fine art class in this semester, I decided to take chinese instead. Besides, I need a foreign language credit. Tomorrow I will need to see that professor to see if I am allowed to be in that class. Hopefully, I can. I have been worried about this over the whole day. I wish everything can work out fine tomorrow. ",0
"Alright, this is going to be pretty random, so whomever may be reading this should be pretty amused. Hmmm. . i had my audition for the """"Madrigal Dinner"""" tonight. I think it went pretty well. I sang a song that I wrote. He seemed pretty impressed. I find out Monday morning if I made it or not. I think until then I am going to have a nervous tick thing happening. I broke up with my boyfriend this weekend. He is really stupid, """"dumber than a box of hair"""" as I like to say. That sounds pretty mean, but he really is. He isn't going anywhere. He is a 5th year high school student. If you carry on a conversation with him that involves a word with more than 5 letters, he is lost. Unless it is about auto mechanics. Then he will talk your ear off. Or if it is about drugs, he can talk 499000 miles an hour on that subject. We were just too different. I'm not into drugs and stuff and I am 17 and already in college. He is a pot head (along with other things) and he's 19 and still in high school. He is going nowhere. He wrote me a really shitty letter today. It made me feel like crap. It was along the lines of """"I am nothing. You are too good for me. I should have known that the second I got something good I would lose it. """"  How am I supposed to respond to somthing like that?????  My friends said it was his feeble attempt to win me back. A very feeble attempt. I am not conned into taking someone back because they make me feel guilty for ruining their life. I feel really bad though, because his parents absolutely adored me. I was everything they wanted him to be. I am fairly intelligent, Christian, drug-free, etc. I feel kinda like I let them down. But I wasn't getting to him. I couldn't change him. It's not my fault right??  What could I do?  I can lead him to the right path, but I can't force him to change. I showed him what Christianity did for my life, did in my life, what influence God had over me. But he was so stuck on his paegan ways. He told me he was going to quit drugs for me, but he never did. I can't be with someone for the sole reason of trying to change them. I don't know. I miss my ex-boyfriend. Not the same guy. A different one. We went out for 3 years, then he slept with my best friend. On that ridiculously long survey that we had to do for this class, that """"worst depression"""" stuff was caused by him. 3 years!!!  And then he just threw it all away. Gosh, I miss him terribly. Sometimes I still cry at night thinking about him. I have yet to find a love so strong like I had with him. Have you ever felt that?  That feeling like you know, I don't know exactly what you know. You just know something. That feeling deep inside. That feeling noone else can give you. I had that with him. We were even engaged. Engaged!!  He made me feel like I was something worth having. Well, until he screwed my EX best friend. Stupid whore!  I'm not bitter. Hehehe, anyway. I don't know. Sometimes he is all I can think of. I'll catch myself comparing other guys to him. Every other guy I have dated has been compared to him. Should I put a name to """"him""""?  His name is J. J. Anyway, I always have this emptiness inside me. I didn't feel empty with him. It was like he made me complete. And when he left, he took a big part with him. I know that sounds trite, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. Just pure emptiness. I got so depressed after the """"incident""""  that I didn't have the will to do anything. Nothing. I just laid there in bed. I would be in a trance through school just to come home and lay there. didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, didn't sleep. I never slept, but I was never awake either. It was like I was one of those vegetable people who was purely living because of the machines they are hooked up to. There was this invisible machine keeping me alive, and that was it. I was just existing. That's the word I was looking for. Existing. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried to make it less. Have the scars to prove it. Nothing I'm proud of. I had just reached the lowest I have ever felt. I'm sure it will happen again. I'm only 17. I'm sure I will find another guy that will fill the void JJ left, but then he will leave me too. So what's the use anyway?  Dating is just a vicious circle. Someone is bound to get hurt. If not you, then the other person. Unless of course you find that one person that doesn't have the urge to bang one of your friends. But shit, that even happens in marriages. You think you found that one person that won't screw you over, and what happens? They screw some younger, prettier girl. Gosh, I'm really bitter. When did I get this bitter??  Is it bitterness or cynicism?  I can never tell the difference. Maybe I'm a little (or a lot) of both. <Deep sigh>  One minute left. Okay, now I'm depressed. I was in a good mood after my audition. Then I get to thinking. Damn thinking. It never does me any good. I always seem to think about things that depress me. I think it is because all of my good memories are linked to painful ones. So I try to think of good ones, but it just takes a turn for the worse. Adios! ",1
"So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to Simon and Garfunkle I love them, one of my best friends, Hilary and I used to always sing to """"Cecilia"""". Hilary goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on Friday. Monday I have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to Gregory but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 2 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 1� hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie """"Bring it On"""" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 22 minutes! Bye ",1
"Start 12:10 I should be eating right now, the hypo campus must be acting up. But this is due manana so better keep it going, a lot of thoughts flash through my mind, but only a few really become selected and sorted out, odd, what tells the brain which are important Music is cool, it's my life I live for it, random yeah maybe it's not so much a stream as it is jumping around, could you fail if your thoughts don't follow a pattern, that be kind of funny. I'm in the computer lab in Welch and I wonder if the clackity clack of the keyboard is starting to get on people's nerves. Why did I pick the keyboard with the loudest keys, oh well can't stop now, There are layers of thought purple dragons just popped into my head when I tried to clear my mind and let the next new fresh thought come in why there are purple dragons lurking in my sub consciousness? I'm not sure maybe it has something to do with the little dragon on my amp, I named him puff, he sits up their and guards the amp, this is sad just looked up and realized how little I've typed, even though it's been constant typing, I had a thought when I was typing that but it got lost when I was typing it, no just remembered, it's that thought are so heavily influenced by environment. and yet they aren't, so many times your thought return to a constant theme that is prominent in your life, for me mainly my music, some other more personal things too, but they are usually shorter term. so many people walk in and out of this lab, probably not the best place to write this but who cares yay, Creed concert in Alamo dome October 5th, Thursday, hmm let's see today is also Thursday I get off at 3:00, it starts at 7:30, sweet, won't have to skip class to go, good thing to cause the class I'd have to skip would be a fish seminar with like 15 people in it and attendance is mandatory. Got to get more people for the geology study group, I just told that girl I was starting one so I could meet her, so I better get one together quick, probably shouldn't tell you that but hey, it's one of the blessings of confidentiality right, ok started at 12:10 it's now lets see (glances at watch) 12:24, six more minutes hmm goes pretty quickly I should do this more, actually I do this just in a different form, Writing lyrics so that they tell a story and yet still rhyme but aren't in a meter but are musical is cool, think third eye blind the last tracks on the first cd, I can actually just get pages and pages of lyrical content that's singable by writing shorthand and tracking emotions pretty nifty stuff, I haven't slipped into that mode in this twenty minutes yet, usually it's when I feeling something or am just pondering something like why something is what it is, mmm want food ok 3 more minutes, whoa the person next to me is a really friggin fast typist the real way to do this would be just to write for 20 minutes down on paper shorthand, you can actually record the thoughts better, how boring can it be to read all of these, actually I wouldn't mind reading a couple, just see what people think and stuff, but I wouldn't want to do 540 of them, yucky. ulp, my time is up, wonder what the next writing assignment is, oh well got to go eat. 12:30 ",0
"MY eyes are closed right now and I'm wondering if I'm doing things correctly. I just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. I wish I was there with her right now to talk everything out. Its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. I am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. I want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. I'm just very exhausted. I've been going nonstop this entire weekend. Just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as I type words on this keyboard. I feel it in my neck and the back. I just want to go to sleep. . but I must go on if I'm going to finish all my assignments. I'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. I think I'm going to do my psychology tonight.   and here I am. I'm tired but I don't want to sleep. I don't want my weekend to end. It's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . If I don't sleep yet, maybe I could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. I've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. Now I am wondering whether I'm doing this right. How can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. Right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. I'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think I'm insane after reading this. I rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. How can we truly define that word?  I think everyone has a little insanity in them. Just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term   insane   pretty difficult and complicated. It's not like there is a standard of being sane. Everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? I think its amazing how I wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. I have another thought. My uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. Are they insane?  How could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them?  I wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the   ideal normal    I don't think they do because Schizophrenia is their normal. Besides, who is to judge the   ideal normal?    I read a book by Timothy Findley about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. Basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. Who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own?  I guess this question is a double edged sword. Take from it what you will. I still have no idea. Anyway, Am I doing this correctly?  Oh here's another thought. . How do you know if I'm doing this correctly. it's MY stream of consciousness. Whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. For me I think it's normal. I write these kind of thoughts in a journal. I think the only reason why I'm sort of unsure is that I'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment.  I am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. I'm actually kind of relaxed now. More sleepy. I think my 20 minutes is up. ",0
"Well, I'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that I know I have to do this. Just got back from school and had lunch. My whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy. I cooked it last night, ah. the life of a college student. I've left the TV on. I always like to watch something as I eat. Something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind. It's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast. I've always wondered about the concept of time. How it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time. I have the worst memory. but it wasn't always the case. I'm not getting old so much as I had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago. Headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars. I was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to San Marcos to do some shopping. My boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind. What a nasty shock!. At least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident. I left the TV on way too loud. Funny how I sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others I love background noises. Leave the TV on just for """"company"""". Talk about true desperation. CSI is on. Love the show. Absolutely fascinating. I am such a TV addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom. Got an exam coming up on Monday, got to start studying for that. Hope it's not too tough. Gosh, I really miss home and family. It's tough being away in a foreign land. I can't wait to get back to Sydney and Singapore. I am so looking forward to my trip in Europe at the end of the year. I am so excited about Vienna and Italy. I love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country. It was hot out today. I'll need to buy a fan for my apartment. The ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. I'm glad I missed most of summer, can't stand the heat. Like winter so much better. I'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in Europe. Have to admit that I don't really know what else to talk about. I just know that I want to shower after this but knowing me, I'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the CSI marathon. have to go pack my stuff later so I can continue the moving process. My new apartment needs a lot of TLC before it will be in tip top shape. Then again, only about three more months till I leave the states and am back on the road to Canada, Europe, Asia then Australia. This year has been a most trying one. But I know that I am a stronger and wiser person for it. I've been through so much in life, but I know there's so much more. I'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in Harvard before I leave and a family friend in New York. My body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now. Maybe I won't need/want that fan after all. There's no need for it. but wants are the way the world works. I am almost there, just 2 more minutes left. I really need to focus my time and attention on what I'm doing because of all the surrounding noises. I'm actually speaking as I type. Is that normal? Or more precisely, that's normal for me. I wonder what Professor Pennebaker would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud. Ok. back to CSI. ",0
"     I FEEL REALLY TIRED NOW. I JUST COMPLETED MY PRE TESTING NOW,. THE TIME IS SO LATE NOW, I WONDER IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK TODAY. THERE IS NOBODY IN THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY. I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A HEADACHE. I HAVE SO MANY STUDYING TO DO THIS WEEKEND. I HAVE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK TO DEAL WITH, MY CALCULUS 3 HOMEWORK TO WORK OUT, MY BIOCHEMISTRY HOMEWORK TO DO. GEES THAT SOUDS LIKE A WHOLE LOT TO DO. TODAY HAS BEING HELL FOR ME. TO START OFF, I LOST MY CREDIT CARD. I WISH I WAS AT HOME RIGHT NOW. I COULD WEAR I SMELL SOETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I WONDER WHAT MY SISTERS ARE DOING NOW. I AM SURE THEY WANT ME HOME. BHUT I HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE STUDYING. I HAVE TO DO EXCELLENTLY WELL THIS SEMESTER, TO BRING UP MY GPA AVERAGE. SO FAR I THINK MY CALCULUS CLASS IS GOING ON FINE. My PHYSICS CLASS IS ALSO GOING ON FINE. I WONDER HOW MY LAB WOULD BE LIKE. I HOPE I DO VERY WELL IN THE CLASS. I JUST HAVE FAITH THAT THIS SEMESTER IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I KNOW IT IS. I AM GOING TO TRY AND DO MY BEST. I NEED A GIRL IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER GET A GIRL, WHEN I AM JUST TO PICKY. WHY NOSA WHY?I JUST CAN HELP THE WAY I FEEL. I MEAN IT IS ME, I CAN'T HELP IT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT GIRL, NOT A SUPERFICIAL GIRL, NOT A FAKE GIRL, A REAL, BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY GIRL. SOMEBODY THAT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, SOMEBODY THAT COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM. SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MORE THANANYTHING IN THE WORLD, SOMEONE THAT WOULD DIE FOR ME. SOMEONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GROW OLD WITH ME AND STILL LOVE ME THEN. IF I COULD JUST FIND THAT SPECIAL PERSON, I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN OF ALL. IS IT TOO MUSH TO ASK FOR. I MEAN I AM A GOOG LOOKING GUY AND QUITE A NICE GUY TOO. WHAT MORE COULD A WOMAN NEED. I AM SWEET. SWEET AS AN APPLE PIE. I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR ME. MY SOUL IS SEARCHING TO FIND YOU. I JUST HOPE HER SOUL IS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WELL BACK TO REALITY. STUDYING. I GOT TO GO STUDY. I FEEL HUNGRY AND SLEEPY. ",1
"our world is pretty fucked up. I've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with. well not the only thing, but almost the only thing. the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves. between hurricane Frances and soon to be hurricane Ivan, why do we need Chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse. why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right. be it a Christian, a Muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong. so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too?  """"they're religious. they're unstable. they're on medication. they've had a hard life. man fuck that. people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong. I don't understand this blur of morals and truth. how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong?  I suppose I'll get off my soap box now, I just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet I know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today. the only thing I can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example. so I was just reading bush has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president. ha. that makes me laugh, I say more power to bush, he says he's clean, I believe him, I don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john Kerry. I don't even want to vote, but I feel its my duty. so who am I going to vote for?  its like picking the lesser of two evils?  and which one is lesser of a SOB than the other one?  man I don't know. I suppose I'll vote for bush, being that this is Texas. but I don't know if I'd feel right about that. maybe I'll just write in a vote. I mean I know all of Texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter?  maybe I'll run for president one day?  naw, I doubt it, I'm not moderate enough. not that I'm a radical, just that I don't think I could say things to appease one person or another. I have my beliefs and damn it, I'm sticking to 'them. that doesn't mean I'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but I'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business. this feels good by the way. I'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying. I kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since I'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me. so I'll just let them be. my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently. they're a couple years older than me, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her. she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together. I can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it. anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, I can tell things are getting intense. I didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically I was here first so I suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal. she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do. man, I feel sorry for them both. he just wants to love her, be there for her. and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is. love is a funny thing. love is a fucked up thing too. I've only been in love once. and I've fallen out of love once. its a painful process. but then again, I wouldn't replace it. it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that I can completely support. so why is it that humans love?  or choose to love?  or choose not to love?  I'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling. to be able to call someone and just talk to them. see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things. I wonder what my wife will be like?  I wonder when I'll meet her. my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married I think. I may be wrong, but I doubt it. I think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul. that's kind of scary. hey, my brother is going to be married forever. I'm going to have a sister in law. maybe I'll be an aunt or uncle soon. now that is really weird. its crazy how time moves. I feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time I feel like I still think and act like a 6th grader. oh 6th grade, those were good days. I thought I was the coolest kid in the world. and at the time, I may have been right. I was one cool 6th grader. it rained today. I love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure. it makes me appreciate the day that much more. I've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today. reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things I can support 100% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least. I ate at freebirds today too, that was so good. I'd say the feeling I have after I eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings I'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world. because when I've finished freebirds, I don't even desire love, because I am so full and content I don't need anything else. its a good feeling. I'm thinking about what I'm thinking about writing. if that makes sense. it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and I'm working on that, but I think that I'm thinking too much about it. I've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now I'm thinking too hard about writing something. its ok though, because I only have like 15 seconds left. maybe I'll eat cookies later tonight, I bet those will good ",1
"Wrecks. They are the worst things ever. I can't believe princess Diana died  yesterday. It shows that anyone can die at any moment. Of all people, a  princess, a mother, an internationally known woman, a philanthropical figure  in this world. It's sad. Yesterday I was running down the street to pick up  an anklet for a friend and I saw a wreck happen. it is scary. luckily no one  was hurt but it could've been alot worse. The anklet was awesome though. I  kind of wish that the one I bought was like hers but that�s okay because I got  an even better one later on in the day. I had to sit for almost an hour to  wait for the police to come because I witnessed that stupid wreck. and then  they didn't show so I just gave the girl my name and phone number and then I  left. I have better things to do, like eat. The food here really isn't that  bad. I haven't been eating from much of a variety though. Everyday I eat  from a choice of about four meals. I can live like that though. My roommate  is really starting to bother me. I should have known this would happen , but  everyone always thinks """"that will never happen to me"""". Just like getting in  a car wreck, getting pregnant, or getting a disease like aids or something. I hope I never get any of those things. I don't know what I would do. I'd  feel like such a failure. It does happen to so many people though. And  everyone deals with it in a different way. to each his own. And everything is  just fine to me just now. no need for me to change my life,  I have my friends , my boy, my studies, my sorority, and my own life here in college. Being away  from the parents is such an amazing feeling. just the fact that we are proving  to ourselves that we can do it on our own. feed ourselves, discipline  ourselves, control ourselves, wash our laundry and all that stuff. I�m doing  okay. but I know for a fact that not everyone has been handling themselves as  well as I have. I am me and I am okay. ",1

"I don't know what just happened, but all that I just wrote for the last 10 minutes just got erased. This makes me a little perturbed, but I don't really care. This just allows me to write even more interesting things. Maybe this time I'll talk about movies. Yeah those bad ass little things that I l0ove ohhhhh sooo much. In fact I'm hoping to film a movie by this years Oklahoma game. that way I can show my best friend who will join us from K. C. Together we made 6 movies. 4 movies for English and two for our own enjoyment. Okay the preview for Scream2 is on the tv behind me and its a little hard to pay attention to this assignment, but I guess this is also part of the assignment. How many people does it take to rip off a football from the bumper a of a frog. jello. jello. retard. Bug women can kick my friend's ass. At least that is what he always says. He says that he is going to start going after those women who could actually kick his ass. Me I'm just going after the beautiful intelligent type. It seems like it is working out thus far, but not from m shoes. 4 women are in my life right now. One is an ex-girlfriend who I was very attracted to, but broke up with me for seemingly no reason whatsoever. I think it was because I became too attached, whatever that means. I guess loving someone too much is not a good thing. That was sarcasm. I really don't think there is such thing as loving someone too much. I do sometimes watch myself when I'm trying to meet a girl. Now I wonder if they think I'm trying too hard. Anyway,  my ex gave me a call and we talked for 2 hours. In the talk I felt like going over there and hugging her right there, but she would be missing out on sleep for her next day. I think she valued her sleep more than me. Well no not really, I think we just weren't mature enough to know how we really felt. I still can't really say whether it was true love since I have never had any other taste of love that I could compare it to. Al I know is that I miss what we had, and I want it back. I thought I was over it. He's 30. I am over it. Today I realized that life is not as complicated as we all make it out to be. It this """"real world"""" that we have made up that keeps us under constant stress. The mind analyzes everything and tries to figure out the real world. It is the heart that I try to follow. The heart  gets past all that which seems and goes straight to what feels right. I believe in that feeling over the appearance of a situation. I have led a very happy life and I think I am doing things right. I jus t recently had to decide whether or not I wanted to be a frat guy. Isn�t it funny that I brought this up right after I mentioned I think I�m doing things right. I take that as a good sign. But now I�m hesitating so I take that as a bad sign. Basically I�m still trying to figure out whether I turned down the frat for personal reason or to please other people. When I did decide to quit the frat I became extremely happy, almost to the point of crying in my car. This was when I came up with this decision on my own outside the influence of the other people I know. Then the damn frat got me to come into their house and talk to me one on one. This showed me all the people that I would be letting down by not joining the frat. I can't stand letting people down. I try so hard to help everyone, but its just impossible. I think the reason I felt like an asshole yesterday was because I have let a lot of people down the beginning of this year. Namely the frat and my brother for not joining the frat like he did. He is trying to live vicariously through me and it is a little annoying. I think I first showed interest in the frat just for his sake. I would like to explain to my brother that we are not alike and that my whole life is not revolved around women and beer, but anytime you talk to m brother he just makes you look stupid and I hate that. I don�t feel like I can explain anything to him unless he already believed it to begin with. I think this is why he became a lawyer. ",1
"Well, I don't know where to begin. I guess it started when she came over for lunch. I never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. She swooped in and plopped herself on my new Pappason chair. She was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. As she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the Hit or Miss store I noticed it. How her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. I mean, don't get me wrong Randy is the best friend I have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. As she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. It was barely noticeable that my over grown Lab  Dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. Then the words just fell out of her mouth. """"He's come to rescue me, and I'm going to go. """" I have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. I was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. My best friend was on her way to her life long dream. All I could do was cry and hug her. Then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. There was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and CELEBRATE! Wow. She's gone. What is left of me? I sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. I mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. I don't know how long. It seems like a whole season passed. Then one day, I got tired of crying. I knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and I'd be darned if I was going to let it rot inside of me. So, I did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. I joined a club. I went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. But you know what, I didn't find it. So, I began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. I left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. But, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to meet myself a man. I will find out what love is all about, and I mean real love. So, take that! Thus, my Man Hunt began. I browsed the Video Dating services, the internet (big mistake, HUGE), I scoped men at the grocery store, I bought some roller blades and tried out Hike and Bike trails, but nope, nothing'. Oh, I met men all right, but the kind of guys I met made me want to swear off of them forever. Yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. He's out there, my Prince is going to come rescue me, I just have to have faith in real love. After some serious time had passed, I stepped out of my life and looked at what I had, and noticed that my Many Hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. So I just plum gave up. I was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. And that was it. So, I dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then I began to pray. It helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when I shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? My heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. How in the world can the words I choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the Lord? He is the absolute perfect gentleman. I began to talk with Him every day. I began to listen for His voice and I began to find Him everywhere I went. I realized, I was never alone. I was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. The lord God in Heaven loves me, and I love Him. And you know what else, after I gave my heart to Jesus, I met Mark. Would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 Great Danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as Dixie bolted out my front door. We met, just that simply. He has arrived at my front door now, so I better go. We are on our way to Jamaica oh how I love to be rescued! ",1
"This is a very interesting homework assignment. I wish the rest of my assignments were this interesting. I am a home right now. I can home for the weekend. It has been two weeks since I left for college and I came home. I know it is not recommended to do this but I did. I don't think it will affect me. The only thing is that I don't want to see my mom cry again. That is the worst part. I love typing, it is so much easier than writing by hand. I have not spoken to my two best friends. One of them I am kind of upset at because she is so infatuated with a guy that she blew her two best friends off. That really hurt my feelings. Wow, only two minutes have gone by. I wonder if I am going to have enough things to write about for twenty minutes. Doing the assignment for this class reminds of the class and the cute guys in the class. I have so much homework and I started to work on it at noon, but it is chemistry and it was difficult. I got very frustrated. I also had a lot of distractions. For example, I brought home two weeks worth of laundry and I have been doing all the loads since I woke up and had breakfast. That was about ten this morning. I wonder what is happening down in Austin. It feels weird not to be there, and when I am there, it feels weird not to be there. I wonder what is happening at the Castilian. What is laundry boy doing?  Is he doing his laundry again. It feels so good to be close to my mom and getting her cooking. She is the best cook in the world. My sister's birthday is tomorrow and I am glad I got her her present early. My mom and dad came home with her presents today and she is really excited. My mom gave her her present and it was what she wanted. She was given the chance to get dad's present early too, but she decided to wait. The big game is about to start and I am contemplating about watching it. I really wish I would get around to doing my homework. I have been really bad at managing my time lately. I checked my loan status and everything has been approved. Thank God. Yes I will be in debt forever, but right now the important thing is to get an education at the place of my choice. I have to pay off debts that are roaming around. If I have money left over, I want to buy myself a lap top computer. It is so different how everything at UT is so technologically advanced. Is that how it is on other campuses. The big game is tonight. I wonder if I will ever get around to going to a football game. I think maybe for the experience. I sister was disgusted by something on TV. I can hear the dryer. It has been going almost all day. I had a lot of clothes to wash. How am I going to make time to do laundry. I think since I was instructed by mom to wait until I came home, that is why it piled up. I think I will do it weekly in Austin. I wonder what Jessica is doing right now?  What is she thinking about the issue?  Does she know what is going on?  I really want to talk to her, but I will not look for her. I think it is her responsibility to see what made us feel bad. I think I have justifiable reasons to be mad at her. Wow, the time is almost up. I thought I was going to be dragging this on and on. I was just thinking of the ride home yesterday. I almost made a driving mistake that could have cost me. There were so many cars. Since I have not been driving in Austin, it was weird. I tried leaving Austin right as the schools had let out and there was a big traffic jam on I-35. I was crazy. I was just inching along. It took me about an hour to make it out of Austin. My dad is such a goof ball. He was telling me how things are just not the same without me here at home. Everyone is really emotional. My text books were so expensive. I am still blown away by the prices. Then yesterday I had to buy a stupid calculator. I had a quiz and could not use a graphing one. ",0

"This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask Kristen if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be Kristen or Catherine. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 15 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the Caribbean. It was good. Jonny Depp looked really crazy in the movie. Orlando Bloom is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  ",1
"     what classes do i take next semester?  i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it?  is it too much for me?  i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what God has in store for me, and what he thinks I should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children I will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that God has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that God has blessed me with several things and I am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, I may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason God has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.

"12:58 whoa. Audrey's mom died?  Is that what she just told me?  WHAT? Oh my gosh?  How?  when?  WHY?  Audrey. She's so cute, she's so sweet. she's so smart. number one in her class and this happends to HER. why?  I really don't get it now I feel like I am never going to fight with my parents again. never. did she now that this morning was the last time she'd ever see her mom again?  what if her mom knew that today would be the day she died. how did she die?  in her office!?  they found her in her office at SMU?  I cannot believe this. There is no way I could ever handle this. But I would have to, wouldn't I?  Audrey is, and this is giong to change everything that will ever happen to her. It's just her and her dad now. How would it feel to get a phone call telling me that my mom was found dead?  what is it like to die?  what was she thiking, did she feel and how she'd never see them again?  did she even know she was dieing?  what happens now?  Audrey. I'm so sorry. I really am. I'm sorry that it takes this tragedy to make me realize that I'm not ready for anything. I'm ready for college, I'm not ready for independence, I'm not ready for the """"real world"""", and I don't think I'll ever be ready for death. how does it feel to be ready for death?  I read somewhere that maturity means the ability to accept the concept of death. no. I don't think so, because that scares me more that I ever knew until now. now audrey has to say that her mom died when she was 17. NO!  I feel so horible, I wish I could make her feel better. and those three teenagers that died while mobing down here to UT. How does their family feel?  Thyey wree probably upset enough that they were saying bye to their children, not knowing that'd be the last time Ever. I'm so scared. I want to go home and build a big box and live there forever with my mom, and dad, and brother. when am I going to die?  I don't want to think about it. I'd rather die than anyone in my family. but if I'm not scared of it, then why should they be. wait, but I am scared. but I fear it more for others than I do myself. if everyone thinks that way, then maaybe it is okay. I don't think that death will ever be okay, but I'll hope and I'll pray that maybe someday I'll be able to understand I. I'll have to wake up tomorrow and realize that there is nothing that cannot happen. ",0
" I hope I'm doing this right because I'm not sure. I feel so tired and I have so many things to do in such short time. I wonder if I'll pass all my classes. I'm afraid that I won't make A's and not make it into Medical school. I can imagine how my dad's sisters will laugh at him and tell him that they knew I wasn't going to make it. I feel lost, depressed, and anxious. Who should I talk to, well mayb nobody because what if people think I'm crazy or stupid or something. Everyone else seems relaxed and having a great time. I can't even walk out of my room because I either have homework or some quiz to study. I can't believe I froze today on my quiz and miss two simple questions. What's wrong with me? I used to take pressure fine now I feel like some crazy person. I miss Peter, my boyfriend. He understands me. The good thing is that he's coming down and if my dad brings my truck up here, I can go and pick him up at the airport. I want to bring him back to UT and show him around. It's going to be nice to walk with him down the Drag and just showing him the campus. I can't wait to see him. I hope everything goes well since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth. I don't want anything to happen to him while he's flying over here. If anything happens to him, I'll feel terrible because I'm the only reason he's coming down. I hope I can have a good weekend with him. I want to spend as much time as possible with him. But with my parents, God, I can imagine them. They take things so seriously. I wish they weren't so strict and understand that me and Peter are serious about each other. I guess that's why I'm so shy. I could never go out or do anything. Now I can't keep a conversation with anyone because I think that they don't like me but oh, well I don't need them. I have such a headache. It's just all these thoughts I have in my head. I wonder who's going to read this. They're going to think I'm some kind of psycho, however you spell that. Life is so crazy for me. I can never relax or kick back. I hope to God that in the end this will pay off. I wish I was already in med school but hey it all takes time. Now I understand what Dr. Sladek said. That man is so brillant. I hope to be just like him. He does surgeries like nothing. And to think that he didn't make it to med school here in the US and had to go to Mexico. If he didn't make it with straight a's here at UT, what makes me think that I will. What did I get myself into? But this is my dream and I'm afraid to disappoint my family. I've always told them I was going to be a Doctor and if I don't they're going to ask me why, some will laugh at me, others will disapprove of me like Mr. Matthews, others will rub it in my face. How embarrassing? Agh! I even got voted most successful in high school. I can imagine everyone talking about me and how I thought I was so smart. If only they knew I had to work really hard for my grades. I was just like them. I want my mom to be proud of me and I want her to know that when she's old I'll take good care of her. I don't want to see her working hard anymore. Well this felt a little better taking everything out but now I feel like crying. Maybe that will help as well.    ",0
"All I can really think about is how incredibly tired I am. My sleeping schedule has been severely altered. I stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 every night studying, then to get up at 7:00 or so to go to class. Surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, I am not especially stressed although I never seem to be. The only thing I ever stress about in Jason, Mandi, and some of my other troubled friends. Jason really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). I worry about him all the time. Not that I don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. I just think that maybe if I worry about it, it will do some good. There's my logic as usual it's very skewed. I am so incredibly tired. I can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that I lead the most unproductive life at UT. This really isn't the case. I just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness I suppose not necessarily unproductive. People can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. This difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, I am not capable of articulating it. I can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. I have Biology in an hourI don't want to go, but I know I will. I haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. The one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. I suppose this is a good thing though. I am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. There is something strangely humorous about it again; I can't even begin to articulate what it is. Just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. My sense of humor is rather odd. I have gathered this from several sources: the fact that Monty Python is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that I can laugh at anything without having any real reason. Random laughter. It's good in some ways. This doesn't look like twenty minutes of writing, but I suppose that if I have been typing for twenty minutes, then this is twenty minutes worth of writing. I am so smart I amaze others and myself. ",1
"     I am really hungry right now. I think I'll go eat lunch in about twenty minutes or so since that's how long I have to sit here. I hope my classes this year won't be so hard. I want to be somewhere tropical maybe Cozumel or Aruba. The weather here is ok but it's so hot. Like the other day I think I was going to pass out because I had to walk like 2 miles across campus and then I found out I was in the wrong building. Some of the people who work here are real jerks. The girl at the library was no help and she was rude to top it off. She told me to go to the help desk when I asked her how I got an IF account. I dont' miss that many people in Baytown. I do miss my parents and my dog Frida. I wonder how tommorow will go since it's Sept. 11. i hope no one pulls any stupid pranks or anything like that. I really wish I could be with my family but thats no possible since they live 3 hours away and I have classes. My cousins are so cute. I am looking at t picture of them right now. Lauren is a so elegant looking and Suzanne's the quirky one. I feel bad for Nicole becau se she is losing her job. Dynegy was bound to go under once ENgron did. I never kep up with that guy Kenneth Lay, the CEO for ENgron, or I think thats what he was. I miss seeing my dad and visiting him at his work. I wonder if I am depressed. Sometimes it's hard for me to sleep at night, but who knows. I have one, two three four, five six pictures in frrames in my room. My roommate just left for class. SHe is cool, but We have some conflicting religious beliefs. Being a mormon must be hard. I know the are ostracized alot. I justdon't get the spirit child thing about how we were spirit children in heaven with God before we were born. . or the part I read somewhere about how you have to wear holy underwear and things of that nature. TO me,that's just crazy,but I have to respect other people's religions and beliefs because that's what I expect from them in return. I am so hungry. I want to go eat. I wonder if I have gained any weight since I've been here. When I played soccer in highschool I was so much more muscular and toned. Now I have to find time to work out. Where is Sarah? I think is in her room or doing laundry. Her room mate is so nice, but I feel bad for her because of that Nick guy she dated who just broke up with her. SHe is too nice. SHe's to pretty for him anyways. Some of the food inthe cafeteria scares me. I always hear horror stories about people eating food and finding things in what they are eating. Ughhhh. Now I'm not going to be hungry anymore. I don't have anything in here to eat except for fruit. I am sick of getting up at 8 in the morning to go to Spanish. My professor is ok, but he can be too sarcastic at times and I just want to yell. Yeah. so I am debating on whether I should do the Diamond Dolls. Jenny is in it and she said it was fun. Chris would get mad though. I don't know. He may play baseball here next year, or thats what I think now. but I hope he does. My cold is annoying. What time does the mean lady at the front desk work? SHe is gripey. Jessica and her boyfriend fight alot. Kalie shouldn't tell them what to do but Ithink she just feels authoritative because that's how her stepdad seemed when I met him. Where am I going to eat tonight? Is Uncle Phil back in town. That birthday card Kara sent me was really sweet. I'm glad we have become closer than we used to be. I used to think we would never be close because we don't have that many of the same interests. SHe has lost weight. I wish I could lose 10 lbs. I am going to work out at 3. Then I will be back here at 4. take a shower, call Aunt Beth and see when we are going to eat tonight. Mimi and Poppa are coming. that's good since I never see them . How far is Granger from here? There is a really loud annoying girl who lives in my hall. She talks about crude things. I wonder if you can tell how smart I am by reading what I'm writing. I hope I don't sound like a fool. Who reads these things anyways. I like listening to Enrique. where is he? When is lunch over? Gosh I need to stop thinkng about food. That's not good. I don't want to be fat when I get olded. How many students does UT's law school take every year. I wonder if I could get in. I need to send those checks off so they don't expire. I am so wasteful sometimes. I need to get a book rack so my books and folders aren't thrown all over the floor. How fast does the fastest typer in the world type? I think I type like 60 words a minute. maybe I'm off. that was like years ago in BCIS. Tomorrow better be safe for everyone. I am cold. THe ac is on high. . yeas ",0
"I have been asked to do similar exercises in the past in which I was supposed to just write nonstop and track my thoughts or create a story, a cell phone is going off right now but it is not mine, I just got a brand new phone, it is a really cool camera phone, sometimes I hate having my cell phone because people just won't stop calling me and it gets really irritating, especially if you don't want to speak to the person who keeps calling you. I met this one girl Amy, and she called me so many times but the problem was I was trying to avoid her because I was not' really interested in her. But I didn't want to hurt her feelings because I know there are times when I have felt lonely or hurt myself. Anyways I would rather too many people call me then nobody call me. Last year I didn't have a cell phone and I wasn't really as socially active as much as people expected me to be or as much as my friends were. I really hate the keyboard that I am typing on. I am in the library right now, in the RLM building, I came here to come to a spanish class to see if I could get into a class I wasn't registered for. I promised my mom I would come and check this class out because most of my classes right now are not to difficult and I have a lot of time. Something I am not really used to. Anyways my mom has been bugging me about taking a foreign language for some time now because she desperately wants me to learn something. she owns a translation company and thinks it is vital that I be able to communicate at least in Spanish if I am going to live in texas. I really do agree with her but I don't really want to learn a foreign language. I took french in high school and it was really tough. but maybe that was because I didn't really work hard my first two years of high school and I never really paid attention in class. Maybe I will be better now. Anyways before when I was asked to do similar assignments I never was really able to write anything down. I remember one time I was asked to just write nonstop and then later what ever I wrote about I would use later for the topic of a story. The problem is that I really wasn't able to write anything down at all. Usually when I write something I like to think long and hard about what I am writing about and then phrase whatever I am writing in a very articulate and cleaver way. I am really hungry right now, I never ate breakfast. I usually don't eat breakfast but I usually don't' get up this late on the weekdays. I had a rough night last night. couldn't fall asleep and I didn't wake up till 12:25. I had a class at one otherwise I might have slept later. There are some people passing by me and I keep looking over wishing for some reason that I recognized them or that they went to my high school. my eating pattern since I got to college has taken a weird pattern-back to my no breakfast-I have 14 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times I will only use 5-10 of my meals a week and that is being generous. the first week I had 10 meals left, last week I had 6 or 7 meals left. I am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me, he can use one of my tickets but he won't come because 2 years ago he got kicked out of towers and I guess he is afraid of going back. somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward's way. he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time. He is by no means a bad person, he just doesn't like to be told what he can and can't do if he doesn't agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else's time schedule. He use to be different, he use to be such a little goody good, he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp, I use to hate him when we were little and then other times I would love him but mostly I would hate him. Now I think he is one of my best friends-I think that this is because ever since I have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me, he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel welcome and special, my parents will say the exact opposite about him, they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate-they fight a lot-and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they don't see things that I see. I am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since I have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time. My parents will say that this is his specialty-relaxing and having a good time-they think he is really lazy and can't    be bothered to ever move, but actually I have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task, since I've been in Austin it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis, and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women-this is not by chance. well my 20 minutes already passed ",0
"Today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? It's only the 4th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. I stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at Jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. It's awful. I've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. I wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool I guess. I got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. I'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. This oatmeal cream pie is great, I'm so hungry because I haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. I hate when I don't know everything. well I don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. I hate when I can't understand something right away, probably because I know that means I have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. I swear that when I used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. I wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now I'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when I used to eat them years ago. Who knows? or actually who cares. Kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means I'm going to the chem. review at 5. It'll probably be really good for me so I shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. I can't believe that I'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but I kind of feel like I'm missing out on so much in San Antonio, even though I'm not. I can't wait to get some good Mexican food. it's been too long. What a horrible affect working at a Mexican restaurant all summer had on me. Oh well. The football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! I'm so excited, my first UT football games as a STUDENT in the STUDENT section. ha-ha. and actually I think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool. I saw something on Austin's news talking about ordering the games on PPV. that's crazy. I really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and I can't watch them. like the away games for example. That'd be so cool if I could get tickets to the OU game. I hear that there's nothing like it, and I'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but I guess if all else fails I can order ir PPV for 40 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on ABC or something. I actually called Kenny today, after my first Biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. I don't know why but for some reason I really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before I went down to San Antonio this past weekend. it's cool I guess. since I'm here and he's there, but I don't know. I wish that we wouldn't of met, so that I wouldn't have to deal with it. But then again I don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. I wish that I could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that I wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. I like that boy. dang I just admitted it. I don't like him actually. I just don't know. I definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy """"Karla"""" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. Sounds like a challenge. I'm pretty hungry for like some real food, I guess I'll go down to JCL in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and I'm exceptionally tired too. I ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and I don't think it even helped me that much since I barely got a B on the homework. Man, I miss high school math classes. Everything was definitely explained SO much better, so yeah needless to say I'm pretty freaked out about that, I'm actually freaked out about all my classes. Oh well. ",0
"I'm not so sure how I felt about it yet. Not that it was bad or anything, but I'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. It seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. Mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. But than again, I guess the experiments that I did this for will probably deal with those issues. I really don't know why I tried to do that survey right when I got up this morning, I just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, I finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 4 times. That was a little frustrating. There is something else that's really bothering me right now also. Nothing to do with school, but socially. I live in California, and hate to say it, but I am a pretty stereotypical Californian kid. I mention this because I have this burning passion for the ocean. Even most people who live in California don't feel as deeply about it as I do. I knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when I came to school, but I didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. Well anyway, I really miss the ocean. Every night I try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. When I walk to class I even feel it in my feet and legs. Just on their own my legs begin to surf. The same muscle motions, I guess they call it muscle memory. I can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. Or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. That's all I live for. or lived for. Texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while. No I take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, I guess Texas just got in the way for a little while. That's where my problem comes up socially. I now realize that if you're not in California, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. I feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. Like I said, the perfect stereotype. I guess I wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how I felt. How the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. It's a way of life, not just a social activity. It's a culture, and it's become who I am. Not just surfing. I love it but that is only one small facet of why I love the ocean. I just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times I've had there. Whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. Skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. Just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. The ocean can do all of that. But people don't seem to realize that. I love Texas, well I don't know if I love Texas. but I definitely love UT, it's just that I have to sacrifice so much more that I realized that I would have to do. I came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. That's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. It's not that I feel like I'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. But I just wish people would have the same opportunities as I did, or have. I want them to fall in love as I did. But that's impossible if you stay in Texas for a lifetime. Come to think of it, I really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, I think I'm going to do that today. I've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that I lost sight of the one back in SD. I'm going to make a promise to myself that I will never lose touch of what I left back home, or the people that I left. Just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as I continue to grow, and add to those memories here. ",0
"        Lately, I have been having all sorts of feelings. All my life I have lived in San Antonio, TX and now moving to Austin feels so different. I feel so lonely because I barely have any friends in Austin and I am to shy to approach people. Hopefully my year will get better. I don't think that my roomate is too fond of me. I don't understand why she barely talks to me? I try to be friendly. All I do all day is read or call my friends back in San Antonio so that I don't feel lonely. It's odd really that I talk to my mom quite often on the phone.    On top of that I have problems with my boyfriend. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I am having serious trust issuses. I have been with him for four years and I should be able to trust him, but he lives so far away and i don't get to see him much. How do I know if he's doing any thing behind my back? Should I even think like this? Does he trust me? I really do love him. Only recently did I discover that I love him. I wonder if the two of us will ever be together in the future. I really hate my culture when it comes to this kind of stuff. Why do we have to have arranged marriages? What is the point in that?       I hope I do well in school this year. Last year I got good grades, but i really want to make my parent sproud. I feel bad fo rthem really. They pay so much money for my education and living. I feel as though I owe it to them to make them proud after all that they do for me. I really should get a job, but my schedule really doesn't allow me to. I'm not done with class till 5 everyday and I start the day as early as 8. Hopefully next year my schedule will be better and I can get a job and take on some responsibilities for myself.    Living away from home is so different. It's strange really. I didn't think that I would miss home so much. I was so glad to finally leave and be on my own and have freedom. I don't even know where anything is in Austin and I hate bothering the people that I do know in Austin for directions. I don't know if it bothers them that I keep calling.     Maybe I should join a sorority or something so that I can meet more people. I wonder if I can even handle being in a sorority with school work though.      I can't believe I actually decided to change my major. From computer science to nursing, wow that's a big change. Well all I know is that I want to do something dealing with kids because I love kids and they usually love me. I don't want to be a teacher and not a doctor because that is way to much schooling for me. I think being a pediatric nurse will give me the oppurtunity to interact with children and help them. If only my mom would be happy with the decision I made. I don't know what her problem is anyways. It's my life, I should be able to do what I want and what make me happy.     To tell you the truth about what i am thinking at the moment right now, I am really scared about this writing assignment my hands are shaking and I have no idea why. It should be easy for me like writing in my diary . I guess it's because of the fact that I am going to be graded on it. O well, hopefully I do well.     I'm really tired and my back is hurting me and my time is almost up, so goodbye i'm going to sleep.           ",1
"I am residing at Castillian for my freshman year. I have my own personal room, which is more than I can say for others. It is very nicely furnished with all of my personal possessions from home. The entire back wall is a large window with a beautiful view of the hills. All the lights can be seen twinkling, which causes a serene atmosphere and a pleasant way to relax. My parents are paying a small fortune for my to stay here as well as for all of the other things I'd like to do. They try so hard to make me happy, but I'm not. I feel a sense of debt to them to succeed in college. I also believe that this was their full intention. We'll call it a bribe. They spit out money as long as I do well. This shouldn't be a problem for me considering grades have always been important to me, and I myself would like to succeed as best I can. The bribe, however, is the problem. I'm cracking, although that term doesn't quite seem to fit my feelings. Dissolving in a container of sulfur dioxide seems to better fit the description. Everything engulfs you at once and slowly eats you away. Your struck with shock and you can no longer feel the pain. You can always try and get out, but since you are dissolving, everything you aim for slips through your fingertips. I have studied numerous hours to ensure myself the proper background for each of my subjects. I go to every discussion session and can explain anything that has been taught in class or the first chapter of each book. When it actually comes to turning something in, however, minute mistakes always seem to add up. Already after the first day of class, I have messed up terribly on homework. I am incredibly stressed out and seeing the results of this assignment (though it's not for a grade nor does the professor use it for anything) made me more miserable. In fact, it actually brought me to tears. An assignment that means nothing to anyone (except obviously me) brought me to a ranting rage and then tears. I see myself as pathetic because I failed myself and because I can crack so easily. I can't say that my classes are overwhelming, though they take up from 9  7 with a one hour lunch break each day. If I had to guess, I would say that I was unsure of everything. I'm unsure of friends, family, boyfriend, classes, grades, time, money, and so much more. On top of this, I'm left for the first time in my life to attempt at juggling all of these things around at once. I'm sure it will all level out in the end and that I'll eventually get the swing of things. As of now, however, I feel like a mere speck amongst better people who are sure of so many things. I only wish I wasn't born with the disease of being manic depressive (and that my grandmother in France hadn't died last week). It only seems to complicate things. Also, as we said in class, stress can bring about depression and visaversa. Perhaps that is playing a slight role in my emotions. All I know is that it seems so much right now. ",1
"     I am excited about being a columnist, not because I like the daily texan particularly, although I do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since I can go on to write for the DMN or the statesman once I am out of college and I can get internships at newspapers during the summer so It will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, I'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, I don't know if I can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, I don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but I obviously can't leave them behind and I think I want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean I actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but I still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but I can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all I can do is leave my options open so I can make good decisions later, so basically all I can do is write as well as I can and make good grades, I don't know exactly how to do either but I do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means I need to go to the UTLC finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well I can do on my own, I'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, I'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as I love going to UT home games, an away game means that I can eat while I'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, I can watch it with whoever I want and I don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, I would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, I don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so I don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, I'm a little worried about what I look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot I can do about that before the next game but I'll do what I can, I'm bored with classes already, I havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since I am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so I can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more I do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, I've never lived by myself before and I havent lived away from home for that long, I've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since I don't live in a dorm anymore, I miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so I guess the solution to that is to get things done while I'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, I need to get some groceries, I don't think I know how to shop yet, I still havent made a grocery list longer than 12 items and that's not enough when I go to the store once a week at most, I'm sure things will get easier once I get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but I'm anxious to get to the point where I am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management ",1
"     Ok, I'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I've been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of Mark's mind. I hope that no one reads this seriously at all. Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. That was fast, I'm telling you this is a waste of time and I'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. I'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. I miss my wife. Yeah that's right my wife. We aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do. I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously. I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. Now I'll write about pizza hut. They got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this. I love my wife so much. I miss her terribly. There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will. How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth. But since I couldn't choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information. I am a Catholic. This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven. Bad people go to hell. Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs. But wait, the plot thickens. I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. I am almost always right in this aspect. Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. I am not proud of all that I've done in my life. The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. One of the worst days of my life. There is no reason I can use to explain my actions. But I did it to end the relationship. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Good job huh?  Well she didn't want to leave anyway. At least that was what I thought. I was so damn confused. I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend. And I did. I disgraced myself and I hate. Er hated myself for it. I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. I don't know if I'm wrong. But I could be. Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. Now I'm listening to Damien Rice. The little known writer of some of the best music I've ever heard. I think he's great. It's kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but I do. I also like this guy Joseph Arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. I love the way I can relate to it. I recently read """"A streetcar named desire"""". The female role of blanche. She is like my ex. She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they """"want""""  NEVER tell me what I want. Only I know that and I don't appreciate being told. If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them. I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok. You. For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life. Both times by a girlfriends family. I have an extraordinarily pale complexion. The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican. Heh what can I say. ",0
"Okay. this keyboard is weird. the buttons are all flat and wide and the mouse is part of the laptop. ergh this is going to be hard to get used to. why does Dell make their E crooked? Does it make it look cool to them?  Ugh. I have to stop backspacing that's not the point of this thing. ooh. someone's on their I'M. I haven't talked to Radhika in about 4 days. I wonder if she is annoyed that I still call at least twice a week. I need to get out more . I've only made 2 friends since I've been here. well not really, I guess Jaime and that weird girl across the hall from Michelle count. I haven't started getting friendly with anyone in any of my classes and that's going to bad when, my foot is asleep. studying crap needs to get done. Why does Brynn always sleep. I have to walk on eggshells if she is constantly napping. isn't the 20 minutes up yet?  This is taking forever and my hands are colder I wonder if that saying about guys being turned on when their hands are cold is true. This chair's uncomfortable. At least I organized my junk some. I need to buy paper towels next time I go to the store. I'm kind of hungry but I've already had about 700 calories today. these keys are so weird. I keep missing letters because they're not where they're supposed to be. good I wrote the right type of they're and not their. I hate when people mix up their spellings. I probably did in this thing. I hope no one reads it. I have nothing of substance ever going on in my head. I like the clicky noises the laptop makes. I wonder if I'll be able to connect wirelessly now that I bought that card thing. I'll have to find those place things where wireless can be used. I bet the school lied about them being almost everywhere. wankers. ugh I keep hitting the mouse thing. it'll take forever to get used to this thing. 9 and a half minutes to go. come oonnnnn. I don't want to do this anymore. at least I won't have to do a research paper for this class. and the writing seems to be easy so far. My shoulders hurt and my fingers are still cold. Will these people please stop loitering in front of our door. so freaking rude. Now the pain's spreading to my neck. I need a break . wonder if I'm getting carpel tunnel Not again. Damn computer. why did I want a laptop so much. not worth it. stupid Dell . need to stretch. 7 minutes. I have to do French after this. why is that class taking up so much of my time. I need more free time. why can't it be like it was the first week that was nice. Why does. oh crap this is showing up on-line. people are going to read this. What kind of loser would waste their time doing that. I sure as hell don't have time for anything much more than homework and trying to get in a nap somewhere. How can people sleep on the grass? Don't bugs fly in their ears and noses. don't they worry about the sun damage they're. am I the only one around here who uses sun block. why am I only writing in question form?  stop. stop. thinking about my fingers which are still cold and pretty dry looking. Now what was that? What are you doing computer don't disconnect my I'M! Damn you, I didn't tell you to do that. piece of crap. Still hungry maybe I can type and reach over for a granola bar at once. Do circus people ever get bored entertaining ungrateful idiots?  Do PeTA and those SpCA people check up on them to make sure they don't mistreat the tigers and elephants and stuff. Oh almost done thank you. woohooo!  Continue writing my butt! ",0
"hmmmm, I wonder how many people I a m going to meet , some persons painting her toe nails, what color? red I think not looking     I'm hearing this guy and girl talk about classes. I thought all my classes seemed pretty hard but there not. so I think I have back problems. used to wrestle, do weights now, can't squat though, back hurts to much, these beds suck ass, jesters at least. I just got a blanket, a feathered blanket, its pretty nice. Oh, and I also got some new blue sheets, I think I want to go to sleep, but I can't cause I can't go to sleep. Woah! I'm so glad I only need to do this for twenty minutes, these are all random sentences and the punctuation all wrong and I am so behind on my readings for your class. Cedric Bensons in my first class. I have noticed I don't like raising my hand because I'm afraid of being wrong. Making out in public, that is just bad karma. I met these real pretty girls but for some reasons I only want to be everyone's friend. I need an envelope, I need to pay rent wow I like nintendo, the games, how simple they are. I'm going to join the HBSA. it seems pretty interesting but I don't know about 60 bucks. COLLEGE IS SO COOL, some of these dorms smell bad though. Not as bad as my house though cause I left the stove on overnight and the whole apartment smelt like burnt pizza. I'm so tired of working. I want to stop this timer right now though. I need to pay rent. wondering if my breath smells. posters, I need a poster. something blue. laredo. I hate girls, sometimes, I guess really I'm just jealous cause they get a lot of stuff handed to them just because they are women. I want to go to the beach again, or at least move back to california. sometimes I think I am losing my mind, but then I take a few breathes. I also want to join wrestling, maybe rugby when I am older. I need to clean my room. I bought candles and I think I need the buy some more things. I have enough food though. hungry, hungry, hungry. Apartments are awesome. mannnnnnnnn. twenty minutes, this stuffs easy when you have something to write about or not when you have nothing to write. (sigh) ",1
"By back hurts when I sit like this and I can feel the little tendon that is inflamed. I don't really have to think about each letter that I type on the keyboard I just think about what I want to say and it goes from my mind through the fingers and into the computer. I just stopped to think about what to write about next but I don't know exactly what I'm thinking so I'll write about what I just thought. my mind is telling me that it is lunch time and my stomach is agreeing. I think that I am going to eat healthy today because I have been slacking off pretty bad. I should probably eat some of the food that my parents gave me this weekend so that my roommate doesn't eat it all. Gosh my back hurts. Damn rain. Houston has a lot of rain, probably more than Austin I think I like usstin a lot better than Houston, it is cooler here to there is not nearly as much humidity, Gosh I have a bad cough, why do I get depressed so easily I  think my problem is that I am always trying to please everybody else and not myself. I guess that is good because it is unselfish but it is my life and everybody says that life is short but see there I go listening to everybody else again. Goodness I have a cough a headache and my back is so screwed up , it sucks to go from being very active to nearly useless . My whole life has been about having fun and playing sports and now it hurts to bad just sitting here. it is amazing that I was not paralyzed, I could not imagine what it must feel like to know that you will never stand up strait or run or even walk again. that suck but I see now that my situation is not as bad as many peoples. what do I write now I wonder. I wonder how many people will be on sixth street I wonder why my nose is itching and I haven't stopped typing to scratch it . it must be a zit trying to emerge. Janel if you read this you probably think that last statement is gross but I am very frank. I wonder if I am going to do good here at UT. I wonder what song that is being played down the hall so loud. I wonder if that is. Oh well the reptilian part of my brain is telling me that I have written for twenty minutes and that I should do something else. ",0
"This is one of the most interesting assignments to date in my educational career. Never before have I submitted my work over the computer. I pretty much knew what  I was going to write about when I got down here. my ex-girlfriend. She brings out a lot of sensations and feelings, and I can say most have been pleasant, but not lately. The guy next to me seems pretty cool. Some guy just sat down by me. looked like he was lost or maybe self-conscious because he didn't sit long. I guess this place isn't so bad. I've got a hangover. which isn't too bad, considering me excessive intoxication the night before. What a bitch. People type too damn loud!! The guy running this place seems somewhat dorkey. may that be an understatement. Ryan will be happy to know that I am finally going to break it off with her. It's what he wanted, and I too, but I couldn't do it myself. she's too damn manipulating and she's a bad, bad person. Who the hell is she to think that I'll always be here to pick her ass off the ground like some sort of surrogate mother. Last time I checked I don't have any breasts to breast-feed her. But I'll tell you who does. Tiffany Amber Thiessen (also known as val on 90210). They can't be real, say the girls I was watching the show with. what makes them experts on breasts, maybe the fact that they've had them for a long time. But every damn time a girl seems some guy with a ripped ass body they never take in to consideration that that shit could very well be fake, too. I wonder what that loud noise was. I think I curse to damn much. oh well. Yes that would be a cute chick next to me. but she doesn't look all that good. I don't see  any fine girls in here. people talk too much. there are a lot of fine girls here but not as many as were anticipated. now sixth street is where you'll find a lot of honnies. Sixth street is where you'll find a lot of stuff, that's where I got my tattoo, which everyone has said they liked it except the artist(known as forest) who tattooed it on my back. Probably because there's too much detail and his lazy  ass didn't want to do it all. I've got four more minutes left to this assignment  and some guy just dropped his calculator. dumbass. I'm thirsty . und ein bischen hungry, that was a little German for those wondering(hope I spelled it right). It's odd as soon as we see someone or meet someone we immediately pass judgment on  them, we don't know these people but we judge them one first impressions. which can be positive or bad. my first impressions come off better when I've had a little  to drink, not that my sober impressions come off as bad, I can always entertain  people better when I've had a little to drink. . gotta go ",1
"     No what do I write about?I'm typing in a computer lab,and I'm surprised there are only a few people in here. It is cold in this computer lab. It has gotten a lot colder in the past few days. I have a quiz in chemistry and I need to study. My roommate must be wondering where I am. Its really different in college. I have a meeting at   7 tongiht, I need to study for my quiz. THere is a bunch of paper next to my desk, I wonder who left it. The girl next to me is typing a paper, and another girl just walked in the computer lab. She is wearing a red shirt. I need to eat before the cafeteria closes. It closes really early. The computer next to me keeps turning on and off by itself. Someone else walked into the computer lab. He is wearing a blue shirt and jeans. The screen of the computer to my right is green. The room is starting to feel colder. I need to get my jacket. There are noises outside the lab, it sounds like a bunch of girls. I just submitted my math homework and made a 100. I wonder  if I misspelled any words in this. I am feeling overwhelmed as I think about all the quizzes I have thursday and friday, and I still haven't gotten my calculus book. I started to feel sick today, maybe because of the change in weather. I need to get some sleep. This room is really quiet. I see people walking outside of the computer lab. I wish I could go home this weekend. I kind of miss my family, but it is nice here too. I really like my apartment, I need to wash dishes. Someone left the computer lab and knocked something over. Someone walked in with a green shirt. I wonder how to drop this yoga class I was put in. Maybe I could stay in it. It might be easy. I feel really stressed about school, I hope I can get a 4. 0, I really like my biology and chemistry and psychology classes,they are interesting. Only 5 more minutes. I need to run tonight. Its getting darker outside. Its almost 6. THe cafeteria closes at 7:30. I'm feeling tired, but I have so many things to do. and I need to get some medicine. I wonder what my roommates doing, probably watching tv. Real Worlds on tonight. I wonder what my quiz will be like tomorrow. I hear people talking outside. ",0
"Well. hmmm I'm not sure whtat to wirte here to monitor the mind I suppose  ihahve always been fascinated that the mind is the only organ that wants to study its'elf. i am a horrible typer . i'd like to think I'm fast but as what cost of accuracty. uhhhh. this is strange I'm trying to monitor my stream of consciousness but I am so aware of it as I perform this assignment that it does not seam to want to flow. i don't want to write down anything too embarrasing but why should that matter?  I'm in college not high school anymore. Social status amongst my peers really doesn't have any more bearing here. It doesn't matter what people think of me now. I don't have to worry about my appearanc all the time. though I still do. I suppose that's how shallow I am. I have to always know that I am looking good so that way I can feel good about myself. that helps me exude confidence. and that's attractive to women. But I'm not here to get a mate I'm here to get an education a degree so that way  I can be financially secure for the rest of my life but is that what the ultimate goal in life is. I think about this. is the ultimate goal in life to  make money, settle down, and start a family. to break this down means to say that we are to reproduce. buy why?  What is this necessary drive in humans and all creatures to propegate and keep the species going. basic nature to survive sure but then again why??  It seems like there should be other goals and other things to achieve in life. not necessarily to have children. will having children when I am older make me happy. i suppose so. I mean am I exactly like my father as he is exactly like his father before him. after all I'm already on the right track they both went to UT. but as much as I have fought with my dad in the past I think that I have done most everything in my life to please him and make him proud of me. I'm pretty sure that I have done that as he tells me that he is proud of me. i sure saw it in his face the day that I got my acceptance letter. i've never really seen my father cry before. but I think he  almost did when I yelled out that I'm going to be a Longhorn!!  That's something that I will never forget. the look on his face and the look on mom's. It makes me feel good to know that they are proud of me. but I have often wondered whether or not the things that I have accomplished in my life I did for myself or I did for them. i mean I have never regreted getting good grades or being in band and learning to play the trumpet. but did I do it all for myself or did I do it partly because I wanted mom and dad to be proud of me and to not have to be worried about me. hoping I won't turn out like Adam. It's not that my brother is a bad person. it's his mind right. Manic-depressive with bi-polar and narcisstic tendencies. and his refusal to take his medication. why??  I never understood what was so hard about taking his meds. he'd be fine but instead he chose drugs and alcohol. it's so weird I felt so bad like it was something that I could have fixed. something that was a problem that I had the answer to but it just wouldn't come out of my brain. consciously  I know that's not true. but deep down I still wish that there was something that I could have done. to keep him from hurting mom and dad and the rest of the family like he did. i never saw someone breakdown as much as my mother did. but Adam is better now I don't know if he's taking his med. but he. time's up ",0
"Humm. This is very different from anything I've had to do before. My finger really hurts right now because I cut it last weekend, pretty deep too, I probably should have had stitches but I didn't. Now I'm going to have a scar on my finger tip and it really hurts to type anything, especially on this keyboard because I'm in a computer lab. I'm not used to this keyboard, I like the one on my laptop but my room mate is asleep so I can't really hook it up right now. I wanted to just plug the internet into my laptop somewhere else, but I couldn't find anyplace, I tried the port in the study lounge but it's disabled. Then I had trouble getting on a computer here. I don't have an IF account because I'm in the business school, they just gave us the logins for that and I've never needed anything else. I'm just glad my friend came along because he logged on and let me submit this. I'm kind of tired. I haven't been sleeping well, I'm used to sleeping from like 8:00 in the morning until like twelve or one in the afternoon. This weekend I didn't sleep Friday night, and I partied Saturday night and didn't go to bed until like six in the morning on Sunday. I slept like nine hours then though because I had been up for forty-six. This week has been weird hours too. Sunday night I slept for like two hours, that wasn't bad, my body only needs like five hours of sleep or so before I wake up and can't go back to sleep. Anyways, two hours sunday night, then I got four on Monday night, none on Tuesday night, and then about three and a half last night. Now is like 4:30 I think, the clock on the computer says 3:39 but I think it's wrong because I thought the clock on the wall said like 4:15 when I came in from smoking a cigarette. MMM. cigarette sounds like a good idea but I have to study some more after this. The sleep schedule that I have is kind of weird with classes in the morning, but I've been doing a lot of studying lately. I hang out with my friends during the day and then study with a few of them at night. Tonight it was me and my friend Cimu and Kenchi studying, Cimu went to bed at like 3:30 or so. Kenchi is here now thank god or I wouldn't have been able to do this until the morning when my roommate wakes up. She goes to bed at like 11:30 and sleeps until like 10:00 in the morning. I don't understand how a person can sleep that long, I can try to go to sleep at a decent hour but it doesn't matter because I have to lay there for like an hour and a half before I fall asleep. Then once I finally do get to sleep I only sleep for like four or five hours, I just wake up, not to go to the bathroom or anything but I can't ever go back to sleep. I hate it when my alarm clock hasn't gone off yet and I wake up. If it's just like ten minutes before its set to go off, I don't mind. But when I wake up and there's an hour and a half or two hours left to sleep and I can't go back to sleep it sucks. Then I just have to lay there and be board when I could be studying. At least I found some other people that like to stay up all night though. Shaun is really cool, the other night we stayed up the whole night because we weren't really tired. He likes to sleep during the day but I just don't like to try to sleep. We hung out earlier in the day and then studied all night in the lounge beside the jester desk. We could have gone to a study lounge I guess, but we both have laptops and         ",0
"When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was """"What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?""""  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like """"What song best describes you?"""" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by Mariah Carey. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 8 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel. ",0
"     I always pride myself on my ability to be creative but lately i feel restricted. I am spending more time absorbing everything around me than actually reflecting. I also feel lonelier than usual. I know this is normal, so I don't feel strange for the feelings. I am used to being surrounded by chaos and people  I know. All of a sudden, I'm in a school more than twice as big as my town and a dorm more than twice as big as my high school. I am deep down enjoying the experience. On the surface, I am just caught up in reorganizing everything. I am also still recovering from last year. I keep thinking that things will pick up and that I will meet people. I don't know if it is just a slower process than I expect or if I have high expectaions. All I know is that I love Austin as much as I miss New Mexico. I miss the scenery and the openess but now I get to enjoy a more vibrant and colorful scene. More than anything, I am excited to be around new music. I am listening to Grateful Dead right now- as I have for the last year. Right now, I feel that my scene suits the music more. I also am excited to be around live music. It has a better taste. I think I miss good New Mexican food (burritos) almost as much as I miss my old room. I miss being able to walk down the street without running into another person if I feel like it.  I miss my friends. I miss being able to have inside jokes and laugh without even talking. I think I have more potential for good friends because Austin appeals to a particular crowd including myself. In NM, I made friends with the peop[le that were available. In Austin I will make friend with people that I hve common interests with. That is why it takes more time. I am not used to the freedom that I have recently obtained. I want to experiment with the limits of my freedom, but I just haven't found good opportunies. I haven't done much since I've been here. I can't tell if I'm lazy, timid, or just in the process of figuring out my niche. Education is more interesting when it is by willpower. I like learning when I have the choice to go to class. I also get the idea the teachers in college enjoy teaching more. That may be a generalization. I'm a bit scared aobut tests. I don't know how to study yet. I actually was scared yesterday, but not today. I bought a   to-do   list yesterday and wrote down everything that I need to do. Even though I haven't checked off much, I feel so much more organized knowing that it's written down. I actually fell more compelled to check stuff off (that's why i'm writing this now). I hope I don't fall victim to my lack of self dicipline and poor study habits. I truly enjoy being disorganized and careless. I think it gives me more personality and a more colorful life. A reckless and wild life has its o elegant motion. More than anything, I think having careless adcventures (i. e. hitchiking home from a party) makes me more creative. All I want to do in life is to write. Well, I want to do more, but that's my main ambition and source of happiness. I think adventures inspire what I write just as much as education builds a foundation. All of my college experience will be relevant. I get excited writing about what I want, but I then look back at the time I've been here and feel a bit unaccomplished. My wrist keeps popping when I type, and it really hurts. I have to slow down. I should probably start working out again if typeing at my computer is strenuous. My roommate is cleaning our room right now. She is a bit cumpolsive, but I'm glad that it inspires me to stay organized. Well, I'm organized on the surface. My closet and drawers are a different story. I love how I decorated my room. I think interior design is next on the list to writing. I wish I could study it, but I don't think I could make it into the school of architecture ",1
"Today was a very hard day at school. After my first class, M408D, I read my Economics book for what seemed like forever. My friend Chris can be a bit pushy sometimes and it makes me pissed off. He is one of those, Everything has to my my way"""" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in """"Spanglish"""" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. Kramer is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with Jim Carrey's. The timer says 3 minutes 20 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do. Put up our sheep, clean the pool. My mom is going to kill me if I do not get those done. I guess I can tell her a was busy typing a psychology paper but that will never fly. I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 15 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on USA. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 3 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $5 off a bag that I could get at Wal-Mart for about $2. I did not get one. but if I had a quarter on me at the time I would have. I need to turn on my light as I can only see my keyboard's keys from the light my monitor is putting off. It is too dreary outside and my window is proving useless right now. I needs to rain. They say it will here soon in the next two or three days but you can never trust that. Those weather guys try there hardest and use computer models to """"predict"""" the forecast but when you get down to it, they are really just making educated guesses. But a weatherman does seem like a cool job. You can basically lie to people every night and get away with it by saying """"Well we try to predict the weather the best we can but Mother Nature does what she wants sometimes. """"  Alright, I only have 8 minutes left to write. My the time goes by fast when you are actually thinking about stuff to write. My computer is getting old and I need a replacement. I have pop-ups bad. Somehow, somewhere, I got a file on my hard drive that contacts pop-up servers and brings them to my machine. In doing this, it wins because firewalls are useless against programs that contact other servers from inside your machine. Basically a firewall prevents incoming signals from a machine that you did not originally contact first. User-initiated contact goes through unmolested. So by masking it self as a program, the file is able to bypass the firewall by making contact with the pop-up servers. I only have 5 minutes left to write now. That is good. Man, this is a sweet part of The Rock. This is the scene in which Nicholas Cage is in a yellow Ferarri and is chasing Sean Connery, who is in a black Hummer. This scene has a lot of good action. I like action movies. I guess as I guy I find them more appealing than drama or suspense movies. My belief is that in order to make a good movie, a director has to have lots of guns, explosions, and really hot girls. Without these elements, the movie will not appeal to guys my age. I still need to get my Economics book. I got the main one but the second one is still at the Co-Op. My luck they will run out of it by the time I remember to go by and pick it up. My dog needs to stop scratching. And my other dog needs to stop bothering my oldest dog while he is scratching. I would find that annoying. Man I could really use that drink now. Good thing I have less than a minute left to type. In the words of Homer Simpson. """"WooHoo!""""  This has been fun. I actually wish I could've had more time because there are more interesting things going on in my mind but oh well. Hope this is a good paper. Oh, it says if I want I can still keep on typing. In that case I think I will. Where did my remote go?. HAHA. got ya. you thought I was going to type more didn't ya?  Well ok I am done now. I can finally un-mute my TV and go get that Coke. ",1
"     Okay, I thought right now would be the best time to do this. I'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. This is all that keeps playing over and over right now. Where did we mess up? Well the past is the past and you can't change it. My dad came down and was very disappointed. He didn't know I had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and I don't evne get drunk. I get a buzz and I'm good. I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. For some reason he doesn't beleive it. He was furious. He's always trusted me for everything and never thought I'd mess up like this. I do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. So they would think of me as they saw me everyday. This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people. I'm a real easy going person. The way I think is that I don't care aobut anything. I let things happen. I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen. I like to make people happy. I'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win. If they think they are right than they feel good. As for me I don't care. I know I'm right or wrong and I let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it. I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly. I hate no one, I think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. Once someone screws me over than I don't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone. Well I guess that's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. Very bad excuse, I know. My dad thinks it's peer pressure. Peer pressure has never gotten to me I odn't think. I have a strong will about serious things. If I think it's bad and will do something to me I don't like than I won't do it. I tried weed too because I wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. I tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and I have astma so I decdie that wasn't for me. I never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. So so I decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times I liked the feeling. It was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. My mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. My mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. I would hate that. My dad I don't know. As I sit here thikngi aobut him I feel more and mroe sorry. He came yesterday and gave me a lecture and I said I wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because I couldn't be sincere I thought it was bullshit. A few drinks every now and then can't hurt. Well I know it can but still it's weird I don't know how to explain. Well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. Me and my dad rarely talk I talk to my mom aobut my problems, so I got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if I was still going to dirnk and if I had done any other drugs. He doesn't trust me me anymore. That hurts the worst. I'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because I l;iek to think things thorugh. Right now I feel very guilty. I totally blew my dad off this afternoon and I saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. I guess I get it from him. It's weird. So now I'mthinkngi aobut how I can make it up. I got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. We tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. But somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. My dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. She said I sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. For some reason I still lsiten ot her so I'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that I'm going to stop drinknig. I really do want to stop now. I know I can stop if I put my mind to it. I don't need alcohol anymore. One night can ruin the next 6 years haha. It's crazy ",1
"I've never really thought about what I'm thinking before, there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket. That's OK though because this is a dorm. They are talking now, wait I can't here them anymore, wait they just started talking again. I wonder what they are talkig about, probably something unimportant. I really need to find out where the Fine Arts library is so I can do this gay reading list. I don't even have a clear understanding of what I'm supposed to do. I assume I just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something. It is really annoying becuase the class is already 4 hours long. There should not be any outside work, but I guess it's not too hard, and if there are not any set boundaries there isn't any set grading material, this means that it is basically completion, much like this assignment. I really want to go to the Texas Ski Ranch tommorrow but I can't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time I could leave would be around 5:30. I hope they have put up some pimp sliders and kickers out there. If anyone reads this and you wakeboard/wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pimp ass Supra Launch SSV and your willing to pay gas money contact me. Because I'm always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself. My roomate is sleeping right now. I can't decide if I like him or not. I don't dislike him, but I can't imagine myself being a really good friend of his. It seem our only link is that we are roomates. He seem like a little bit of a Jesus freak and a dork. That would suck if he was reading this right now, it's Ok, he's not. But you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them, that you can talk to them. You know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable. You can never tell that when you just look at a person. It seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with, that you feel completly comfortable with. You feel you can be yourself, act stupid, laugh, you become a different person when you are around those people. I only noticed that fact this year. This year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me. I don't think I have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other. I don't know what spurred it, but I think I know. I know I know. It was a girl I just got to know this year, but when I realized how important she was to me and how much I liked her she was taken. In my self pity I couldn't find the strength to tell her how I felt. I think I was scared of losing the friendship we already had. I didn't want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual. I should have just told her and gotten it out in the open. She changed my life. I got the idea in my mind that to be with her I would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship. She was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape. I still think about her and I know in my heart I will pursue her the next oppurtunity. The weight loss brings to mind another point that I have noticed about people. For as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit, It's bullshit general (bulshi         ",0
"I am thinking about why exactly I am writing this. I am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys. Roseanne is on and it is starting to distract me. I really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me. The show is talking about feminism, which brings up an interesting point. I really don't like women who are amazingly feministic. I just forgot what my next thought was. Oh well, I feel kinda of hungry. Maybe I should get something to eat. But instead I have this laptop sitting on me while I try to type my steam of consciousness. Speaking of stream of consciousness, which I spelled wrong above. The stream of consciousness is something that I read in the textbook. Some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves. Roseanne just made a joke and it is funny. But as I was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses. Before I digress, or maybe I will or maybe I won't. Now that I choose to reflect on my day I realize that I didn't get that much accomplished, but there is still a lot of the day left. I am really not sure where I am going from here. There was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah. boy I sure do love hi I just answered my phone and it is Kristi my friend she is also in psychology. we are talking about this assignment. she is walking back from the dobie center. I am supposed to meet her and her friend Richard. I am going to play Richard in football on the video game. Boy I really like football. Like I was saying I love football and I can't wait till the game against Arkansas. Boy that is sure going to be a good game. I just happened to notice that I only have six minutes left to write. I really like this assignment it is really fun. My hands are getting tired of typing and I just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny. I really don't like Roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention. I am really trying to concentrate on what I am thinking but I believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more, because I am thinking so hard. My computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot. But in here it is actually cool. Speaking of my dorm room, I really like it. Well my 20 minutes is up but I am just going to finish writing this last line right here. ",0
"Wow, that psychology chapter is really long. I am so mad at myself for letting myself get so far behind already. Hello, it's only my third week of school and I am already more behind than I ever want to be. I wonder if typing on my computer bothers Gina as much as it bothers me when she does it. Do I have enough selfdiscipline to make myself catch up on all this stuff or am I just going to keep procrastinating until I absolutely have to get it done, like the night before a test. I really hope I can make myself catch up because then I can go out and have fun and not have to worry about what I have to do when I get home. I don't know why I let that bother me so much. Last night, I wasn't really having any fun at all and they all said it was the funnest party of the year. I wonder if it's because I didn't get completely wasted or if it's because I don't like their idea of fun, or if I was just in a bad mood. And why would they think there's something going on between me and Gerardo. EWW! I mean he's nice, but come on. I thought this wasn't going to be like high school. Shouldn't I be able to be friends with a guy without everyone thinking there's something going on between us? Eww! Oh, well. I hope I have more fun with them soon. I would hate to have just joined this organization that they all seen to be totally into and me just not like it at all. I want to be able to gush about how much I love it to all of my friends and family back home and the ones here. What if it turns out I hate Longhorn Singers? That would really be a shame. What if I can't find any organizations I can really get into here? Like the whole dance thing. I looked at UT Dance Team and they looked like a drill team trying to dance with really bad choreography. And the Roustabouts just seems a little too provocative for me even though I think jazz is so fun. Why does it have to be all about sex (as Bryanne says) I really want to take some kind of jazz class because I need to expand my horizons so I can move to New York or Los Angeles and be a dancer on Broadway or a backup dancer for some music artist or in someone's music video. Would it be great if I could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that I could live comfortably? If that was guaranteed, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wonder if this is what I'm really passionate about. All the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do. I mean I have so much fun when I dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me. It would just be fun a job of pure fun. But, come on, who really gets to do what they really want to do. Who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man? People do what they do to make money and I think that's so sad, but I'm one of those people, too. Money is important to me. It doesn't rule my life but it is definitely a factor. I don't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what I deserve or what I've earned for it. And our society is just completely out of whack. Why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws? Why are teachers so underpaid? They should be some of the highest paid people in the world, I think. Because of them, we are able to learn. We would be nowhere without our teachers. That's such a shame. It pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality. Just look at Hollywood. What a mixed up place that is, yet it looks like so much fin to me. I would love to be famous. To have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them. That would be a blast. All you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines. Go to awards shows, and travel. I want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages. But I don't want to learn them part way. I want to be fluent in the way that I don't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think I'm stupid like we do when someone can't speak our language correctly. I wonder what that would be like to change cultures. No one would know anything about you or your past. Like Ludwig. You could be a total loser/reject in our society and be a heartthrob/most popular kid in school in another country. And you're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you. ",0
"I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 8 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 3 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 2 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years, Phillip, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to UT because he was supposed to follow me here and live in Austin too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics. I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester. I worked 6 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working. My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money. I received some scholarship money from Dobie, UT from my home town. We have community scholarship that they give out every year. There was a scholarship made in Phillips name this year. I got that one. That made me feel good I guess. I like being here but it is just really weird. I hope I adjust to Austin soon. I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 2 weeks ago. My best friend Stephanie helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home, but I am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy ",1
"I figured that I would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but I now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. I think about all that I have to do, assignments in school mostly, but I am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. I suppose I'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. Then there's that person I mentioned. I am confused about a certain guy that I really like. Sounds so tyipical, right? I will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. I am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that I have met at U. t. They are so interested in having a good time, all the time. Drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. I ate lunch with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. I don't drink, because of the law (I'm 18), and I don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the Bible says. Life seems so messed up. I'm not depressed about it, but I am bothered by what I see in the world. I feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and I know where it is coming from. It started with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. God has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless God sends revival, things will continue to get worse. Also, I have been reading about the Clinton administration in a book entitled Unlimited Acess, and I think, """"If this is what our president is getting away with who CAN we trust?!"""" Of course, I don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. God is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of His people. Some day, all of this--including the computer that I'm typing on---will burn up. God will come back to gather His elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. God's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. He doesn't have to save anyone. We all deserve damnation because of our sin. We sinned in Adam. But in God's incredible mercy and love he sent Christ as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, that I might be found among those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. I struggle with the same problems that everyone does. But I keep coming back to the cross and pleading the blood of Jesus. I have no inate merit. My righteousness are as filthy rags. It is insane to think that one can somehow work their way into heaven. The Bible says """"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy He has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. """" Jesus is our only way to the Father. Not our pitiful attempts to earn our salvation. Jesus said, """"I am the Way the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me. """" You have to come to God (it is clearly taught in the Bible), but you can't unless God makes you come(also a clear teaching. """"No man comes to Me except the Father drag him. """") That leaves you in a particularly strange situation. You have to come, but you can't. I pray about that one a lot. Well, those really are the things I think about. I'm a Christian, and I live in constant awareness of my Creator. ",1
"Must I write for 20 minutes? Why? What exactly does writing as I think, called my """"stream of consciousness"""" prove? I suppose magical thoughts that exploit my deepest darkest secrets will arise or something. Of course they could if I really got bored because my mind does jump sporadically from idea to idea but who knows? It never stops and I can never focus on one thing for very long before I get bored. I think I have ADD or something because it is hard for me to focus for extended periods of time which I'm sure if that's a fault of mine or genetic or experience because of TV and how American society has raised me. American society is crap. Everyone blames violence on TV as the problem with the current """"violent"""" America. Kids watching violent shows does not make a kid violent. Rather parents not telling their kids that violent shows are fake or parents that are violent or parents that tell kids violence is ok is what makes kids violent. It's stupid to blame entertainment, of course there are some cases where the TV is too blame. We cannot simply say it never does but we also cannot say that it's the root of the problem. The problem is parents and society today. 40 years ago parents would never let kids do the things kids do nowadays. Drugs, alcohol, sex and everything else has become much more liberal. Lets face it, all these things sell and so now we have corporate America where only the strong survive, or get rich, whichever. How the hell can you call this country so great when there jobless, starving and homeless people everyone, including children. Yeah sure for the 95% of people with jobs, even then I'm sure a good % of those people with jobs still struggle to make it. They bust their butts day in and day out to get what they can for themselves and their family yet we're experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in however many years like it matters to those people who are still unemployed or working crappy minimal wage jobs. Yeah, great country America is. I'm listening to this nice piano soloist on cd on my computer as I type for this long 20 minutes and it's quite pleasant. Whenever I listen to this I think about the girl who gave it to me, Marie Tesi. Even though she's getting kind of fat, I still find her attractive. It's very unusual for me to find an asian attractive, well at least in the past. I find a lot more attractive here at UT nowadays because I think I just had a town full of ugly asians or something, who knows eh? Well anyway, I was so """"in"""" to her, never could get her off my mind. I think I have a problem with obsessing over people, well girls, when I like them. I've never had a girlfriend and I've never even had the courage to ask a girl out. I'm so insecure it's not even funny. I wish I could suddenly build up courage and ask a girl out or even get a little kiss or sex or something. I'm no different than any other guy and one good thing is I rarely masturbate so luckily sex doesn't drive my mind and life. I can focus on other things such as watching tv, playing video games and talking to people. I think I want to be a psychologist, the PhD level, so I can do research or get paid lots of money to advise people. People and their pasts interest me a lot, it's freaking amazing what you learn about people when they actually open up to you. You hear about traumatizing experiences and good experiences and stories of best friends and family and deaths and everything else you can imagine. It's all fascinating to me, I love to hear about it and try to piece together how these experiences have made the person the way they are. It's pretty cool to also, for me because I keep being told I'm really easy to talk too. Be it guys or girls, I hear the same thing. So I feel as if I have some sort of gift or something that allows people to talk to me and sometimes that's all a person needs is someone to sit there and listen to another person talk and they will feel so much better. Given I don't know what to say many times but I know how to empathize and sympathize with people because I feel that I've experienced enough pain, hurts, injustices throughout my life so I'm not totally oblivious to everything. I, for the most part, understand that not everything is black and white, there is always a gray area that cannot have a simple answer. There must always be a compromise that comes from both sides or else it will be black and white and life would be boring. Life is boring as it is, why make it more so? A few thrills here and there but life usually is one big long path to death. How you live your life makes who you are and how you are in the end. Is there an end? Well there could be but that depends on what you believe in. Whether it be christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism or any of the ism's, you know where you're going or think you know where your going. So what about atheists?. Well you simply cease to exist. Isn't that a scary thought? You die and that's it, the void. You don't exist anymore. You are no longer conscious and it's like you were never alive. People remember you but you are forgotten once they die unless your a martyr or a hero or king or anything of that sort, but for the most part you are forgotten within 23 generations. And my 20 minutes is up so I'm done. ",0
"I can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course I let him in anyway. What is this control he has over me? I can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. All I see are blue eyes and red hair. Deep, deep blueness. There I get lost into submission. Is it me? Is it all just something I do to myself? Where are the lines I should be drawing. Why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? I wonder if he's sleeping right now? I know he's home. Maybe I should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? His room is so close just right down stairs. I know he look up at me every night through his window. He's sees everybody I let in. I'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? It will be an interesting year. I wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. Although, it's hard sometimes. Especially with the angel downstairs. Ha! no pun intended. I just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. We're so different. I'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. Maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. I think that might be part of it. I read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! He asked me when I met him if I thought we'd be dangerous together and I said, """"I'm not dangerous with anybody,"""" but I'm begging to change my mind. I wish I could see inside him. Usually I can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. I guess I'll just start looking harder. If I go down there right now I know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. I'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. Why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. Then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. Who casts the spells on us? Who laughs at our bumbling confusion? Is it all a matter of having the ideal children? Are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? If so, how does my body know? Do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs? ",1
"I have just gotten off the phone with brady. I'm trying to decide what exacly we will do  this weekend. he wants to go to a hotel, but I know I have to babysit and I'm not sure exactly  how I will tell my dad to pick us up from here. My birthday is this weekend, and it doesn't really  even feel like it. I don't really mind, but I have a feeling Brady probably won't do much for it. I  almost feel like I'm always doing something for him. I should, I really care about him. He says  he will pay for the hotel, but I don't really want that for my birthday. I'ts just not htat important  to me. I feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the TIP program. I know that  sometimes I have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand. I haven't heard  from my mom so I'm not sure if she's mad at me or not. She probably doesn't care, but when  she does find out she will freak. I wish Brady would pay more attention. He tries so hard, but it  doesn't seem like he has the chance to do so. I need to work out. I'm feeling that although I  don't weigh that much my weight is getting out of control. Perhaps I'm overreacting. Kristen  and I went shopping yesterday. I really don't plan on shopping anymore. Yikes. We don't really  need anything anyways. I need a strapless bra though. I'm surprised I didn't get one. oh well. I wish I could figure out what to do on Friday with Brady. I want Kristen to be able to hang out  with us too. He's concerned that I tell her too mucha bout our personal life, but I really don't. Dana kind of pisses me off. Why is everyone so negative about a caring relationship?  She's  probably just jealous, she hasn't been able to keep a guy at all for a long time. I'm concerned  for her because I don't want her to be doing drugs anymore, but she probably is. She has too much  sex too. lol. It's hard to not be concerned with what your friends are doing. Kristen is  surprisingly very understanding to everything that's going on in my life. She's caring and funny  to be around. I wasn't sure what to expect since she's friends with Kristin, Hayley etc. They  apparently aren't waht I expected them to be. They play if off to be all God-like, when in all  realtiy they judge pretty much everyone. I don't think that is right. Although I'm not that  religious, I do care about God and don't think that those kinds of behavior are fair. I'm looking  att he picture of Brady and me. Kris was kind of weird about the whole boyfriend thing. I hope  that brady and I last. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with him. I care about  him so much, and the distance hurts. I think it isi probably for the best though. I can't imagine  having to go to school with him. His roommates aren't as crazy as I thought, but bad enough. I  jut hope that he doesn't get heavy into drinking,a nd I don't assume he will. Sarah is a bitch, I  can't believe she comes off like taht. ugh, it really bothers me. I wonder what it's like at home  without me there. My mom is making a big deal about me not calling, but in all honesty I just  don't care. I don't know why I'm so unfeeling lately. It's probably because I'm about to start my  period. maybe I'll skip it this month, in fact I probably will. I don't usually have allergies, but for  some reason my eyes keep tearing. It's either my contacts or allergies. I just changed my  contacts though. I really have to pee. The eyes watering is a little embarrassing. Sometimes I  wish I coiuld do more. I kind of wish I woul dhave rushed to be in a sorority. I feel as though I  ahve no friends because I have lost them to brady. Should I go to florida with my parents during  spring break or should I spend time with Brady instead?  Maybe I could make money  babysitting. That would be nice. I hope my parents aren't mad because I want to babysit on  Saturday instead ofdoing my birthday thing. I don't see why it would be that big of a deal, but  apparently it is. I kind of want to go tanning, but it's not good with my current skin situation and  whatnot. that reminds me of richard rush. I wonder how he is doing. Spoiled brat. I'm really  hungry too. I'm not sure what I'm going to eat, but I wish Kristen would get here so taht we can  go eat. That would be really good. lol. I'm hoping that I won't look old when I'm 25 or so. Heck, I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I almost feel as though if I marry Brady  will accomplish everything. I want so badly to be with him forever. NO one understand me like  he does. I wish I had saved myself for him, like he did for me. How is he able to only commit  to me?  I must care about him so much that he feels like he should. I'm glad that I've gotten to  know hhis family a lot better. his mom is honestly really nice to me, and I don't ahve a problem  with her anymore. It would be awesome to be ilke paris hilton. She's has it really good. I  wonder what it would be like if my parents lived more like they should. They are always trying  to save money when in reality being multi-millionaires does not mean that you should only do  that. Perhaps it's a shock from the inheritance or something. I don't know. It's confusing to  me. Ok, this is getting old. I'm a little tired of writing. It's probably because I'm hungry. I'm a little  confused as to what I should study here at school. I've had an interst in psychology, but do I  really want to do that for the rest of my life. I know it doesn't just end here, but I feel as though  there aren't many options when it comes to what I can do with my life. yay, kristen got back and  we can go eat now. My time is almost over. I'm about to pee in my pants too. AHHHHH!!!!! some people try to hard ",1
"ok, I guess I really don't know where to start. I just got out of my BA101 class, which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began. I guess maybe I should have stayed longer, but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open, and trying to make friends with everyone around them, that I couldn't stand it for very much longer. this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though I�m writing all of this on one very long  line, I'm wondering if there is some way I can go about fixing it after this is all over, because it is really annoying and it seems as though I'm not writing anything. I don't know what I'm going to do tonight, it's too late to call my boyfriend, he lives overseas, and there is a seven hour time change. I hope everything is going well with him, because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it. If only I was still in France that way I would know that everything was going well with him. this is a really huge box that I'm writing in because the wrap around just came into affect. very strange, very very strange. I guess I'm at a point where I don't exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank. My friend once told me that he never stops thinking, that at all times he is thinking about something, and when you are talking to him, that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with him. that worries me, because sometimes I see I�m smile for no apparent reason when we are talking, and I just know that the last thirty words that I have just said, he is paying absolutely no attention to. my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds, that's not saying that I'm not. But my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in. Maybe that's why I'm taking psych instead of sociology, it's because I�m trying to figure out who these people are and why I chose them as my friends. It could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat I've recently gotten into. My boyfriend is really into existentialism, and so the only thing I've been reading as of late has been Kundera and Sartre. But then of course I must be honest, I'm taking this course because it is located close to my other class on Tuesday Thursday, and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well. Not to mention my friends who have taken soc, told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take. I  hope I get a good grade in this class, after this last semester, my grades are suffering, I literally dropped my GPA by . 4 over this last summer semester, which should indicate that I really didn't do very well. But I only have 35 hours, so if I do well this semester, I can bring my GPA back up over 3. 5 and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again. It's not like they aren't nice now, but they are """"really disappointed how I handled last semester""""  that is """"considering that we sent you to France last you, you could at least try a little harder""""  this would all be said in the James Earl Jones low god-like voice that I always get in my head whenever my Dad is yelling at me. I probably get that in my head, because my Dad yelling at me reminds me of Darth Vader when he's mad at the corporals, and James Earl Jones is the voice of Darth Vader, do you see the connection?  Anyway, so I'm trying to make my grades appear somewhat better, because if I do, they  will probably let me go on the intensive French study program I want to go to next summer. and then I can see my boyfriend he is so cute. I miss him a lot. I tend to think about him most when I'm either lonely or bored in class. That only either maker me more distracted from the work I should be doing, or even sadder about being all alone. If only he could be American, my life would be so much simpler. Have I been writing for twenty minutes yet, I swear I've been writing for decades, and my hands are starting to get lazy, and tired, and I really don't want all these people around me in the computer room, and I wish that I had had the time to take a shower this morning, because I think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell. I have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now, because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving, granted they were here before I even started this little assignment, into the mind of the student at the University of Texas. I'm starting to think I'm going to end this pretty soon, because that is the only thing I can think of right now, is when am I going to end this assignment. I think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant. But you said that it didn't matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes. so here I am my twenty minutes complete, and I am saying good bye and thank god this is over. only one more to go.

"Ok, well here we are. Typing away at our writing assignment. YAY! I hope I'm doing this right. The TV. is really distracting me right now. Not so much that I can't type, but I keep thinking about Abe Lincoln. I love that guy. He's tall. Tall I sure as hell am not tall. That's a shame too, I could have a good tall guy. GEEZE, it's only been two minutes. This sucks. Now, now, give it a chance. I hate you. Shut up. Ok so lets see here. I like apple sauce. Definitely going to have me some apple sauce as soon as am done with this assignment. I have a giant jar of apple sauce sitting in my frig. Hate people. They're so stupid. I hate the way they act and treat others. Ah. I'm rambling, stop it. Ok lets see, I like toys. Toys are fun. I remember the good old days when Christmas was all about the toys. Now Christmas sucks. I hate Christmas so much. I hate the way we have to spend time with the family, I hate all the cheery people, and I hate how everyone is happier than me. I mean if people would just concentrate on . I hate my roommate. Always drinking my water. Why must he touch my stuff without asking. Sorry he just walked in and I remembered that he took my water bottle. Crap, where was I, Christmas blows! It's just I think people have forgot the real me, I just saw some breast on the TV. and now I've lost tract of what I was saying. Ah yes, Christmas angers me. It's just that people, I think, celebrate jolly old saint Nicholas and the bright lights and trees, more than the birth of Jesus. I'm sorry know I'm watching ROCKY IV on TV. I love rocky, he's amazing. I even named my dog Rocky in honor of Sly. Wow not even ten minutes. Well I'm just saying I'd be happier with Christmas if people just went to church all day on Christmas than celebrate Santa Crap. Oh no, I'm talking to myself again, blast I hate when I do that. DING DING, sorry, it's a line in Rocky IV. Favorite line in ROCKY IV, """"Age before beauty,"""" as Apollo Creed lets Rocky, fucking roommate took my boxers. Sorry I just pressed enter as if I was sending a message on instant messi, how do you spell messenger, oh there we go. It's just he was shopping for boxers, and I found a pair that I liked and then. we weren't shopping alone, we had to girls with us, (just for the record. ) anyways, what, ah I liked a pair and. wait, I think I'm screwing up the assignment. QUICK ding dong the witch is dead, the witch is dead. I'm tired and I'm really really dumb. Hi my name is the undead and I like sleeping. ok lost train of thought there. hmmmmmmm, pizza rolls. I smell pizza rolls because my roommate just made some, probably mine that he stole, fucking ass. I want to be an actor. I love that they made five Rockys, I wish I had an accent, like a scottish or german one. The word Finish looks German. I tried learning German, FOR THAT FUCKING WHORE!!!!!!! I hate everything. Especially her. Not really, I actually love her(possibly), I just grrr. , hate that time of my life. I wish I was six feet tall, that would be badass. Hot, now there's a funny word, sorry I just heard the word hot on TV. Now Lacrosse, there's a fun sport. I hope I get to play sometime , fucking roommate always distracting me. NO NO, he cool, it's just I. Get back on tract. School is very educational to me. I like it. Now drugs are bad, very very bad. I got to start eating better, much better. YAHOOO, almost done. I'm not even sure what I've written about, but you know what, it doesn't matter, because I own shit and I run shit. Peace ",0
"There are mostly worries and fear traveling through my mind at the moment. The college stress has really kicked in now that classes have started and much work is to be done. The work is really bothering me in that the level of it is so high. There are many other factors in my stress including being away from home. In the whole 18 years of my life I have never been away from home without my family for this long amount of time. I guess I just miss all the little things about being at home-the comfort, luxery, friends, family, and not to exlude food!  I have eaten Chinese food most of my life and I can say that the dorm food I do not find to satisfying. And the life of college is so different from my previous school experience. UT is so big and so diverse that it's kind of difficult to adjust to. Some people are friendly whiles others may not be. Failure is also a concern for me. I have always done well in school and my parents have high expectations for me to succeed here in college. I miss all my friends and always think about the past and all the good times. I guess I must start all over here and make new friends and continue all the good times. After all, college is supposes to be the best time of one's life. I also think about what I will end up after college-where I'll work and who I will hang out with and if I will graduate here in Austin. My past two weeks here in Austin have been decent. I have been doing many different things like shooting pool or just hanging out with friends or going clubbin in 6th ST. Also I have been busy I might add. The people I have met are very similar to me personality wise. And most of them are from my home town of Houston. I have noticed that there are many different groups of poeple here. I guess the homework load is as much as I expected before I started coollege but there are so many activites to attend to that I find it hard to complete all the work. That is when stress kicks in again and I end up just trying to rush through it. The class sizes are amazing larger than I expected them to be although I knew that UT is the largest school int he nation population wise. I fear that I will not perform as well in school due to all the distractions that goes on like friends wanting to go out and the many places to go to like 6th ST for example. I guess I will adjust to this environment eventually but when I will I am not sure. Rest has also been an issue in my mind as I have trouble sleeping at night when I have early classes the next morning. I am very tired the next day having to walk so much during each school day. But the next night I will find it hard to sleep again. I hope that ends very soon also. ",0
"It all of a sudden becomes hard to think when you are instructed to. haha. I am so overwhelmed with everything I have to do this weekend. I have so much reading to catch up on in all my classes and I am going to have to do it this weekend or I will never get caught up. I hate biology, I'm so lost, maybe I should drop it before it's too late. But that would be kind of dumb. I don't know how I'm going to pass the first test. I wonder if anyone else is as lost as I am. At least I'll be done with this pretty soon and I will have one less thing to think about. Maybe I can get Houston to drive on the way home for Ashton's birthday. I really don't feel like driving all the way back but I guess I have no choice. Wow, I really need to get her something. maybe a she would like a shirt from the co-op. My phone is ringing but it is across the room and I guess since I am being timed it wouldn't be smart to answer it. I wonder who it is. hope it's not too important. I guess I'll just call the number back when I am done with this. I'm really hungry, maybe when I finish this I'll go eat at the cafeteria. Hopefully they will have something good because Jester City Limits is too expensive and not that great either. I doubt they will though, a peanut butter sandwich doesn't sound that bad. My room is so quiet right now, I wish Erin would get back so we could go eat. I hate the annoying sound of fans which is the only sound I hear, but our room is too hot without it. I doubt they will ever fix the air conditioner. I really need to order some concert tickets online before it is too late. Taking Back Sunday and Saves the Day, Panic, and so many more I wish I could get but I'm poor. I guess I'll only go to two nights of Panic too. I wish I was in a band, then I wouldn't have to be in biology. Yay!  Erin's back and the T. V. is on. I would rather be listening to music but I figured I should do this in silence because if I was listening to music I would just sing in my head the whole time. I can't stand dumb commercials or long ones. Erin just reminded me I have to fill out that application. one more thing out of a million. I really need to get on top of things. Too bad I'm not more creative or that application would be easier. Hmmm only a few more minutes to think. I'm tired too bad I have too much to do or I would take a nap. A shower would be nice as well. I also need to go check my mail. I guess I'll do that when we got eat or something. 5,4,3,2,1. finish!   ",1
"     I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet. It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do. I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. I've never felt so busy in my life. Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out Austin, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about. It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary. We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be. At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus. Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation. It was a great detour. Wow, 20 minutes is a long time, I just realized that. I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. So yea, back to the stressed out business. I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 1 at a community college, then I went to Clinton, Oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. I worked and got paid. Good stuff. A few days after I got home from Clinton, I made my way to Austin. My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. And I think we all know how busy things are around here. I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken. For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 15, the weekend before classes start. This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful. And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people. Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in New Mexico, and the reception is in Houston a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in Austin, followed by who knows how long of being in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My home is in Lufkin, a little town of pop. 35,000 in East Texas, just two hours north of Houston, 3 hours south of Dallas, and four hours east of Austin. Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. I guess we'll see. Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.        ",0
"I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at UT because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to CBS and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at UT so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 30 more sec. blah blah    20 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. ",1
"Right now, I am trying to figure out how I can sign up to volunteer at the Metz Elementary reading program because I cannot get in touch with the coordinator. Anyway, I think that something must have happened to her because she has not responded to me. Now I am wooried about where I am going to volunteer and get my hours by the due date. I am watching TV and thinking about the studying that I have to do for my classes. I am trying to find a way to feel involved in this university and make my mom think that I am doing okay so that she will not worry. I am worried about my mom, sisters, and brother because I miss them terribly. I do not want to wish away the time that I have here but I think that I am feeling like there is nothing familiar around me that I can recognize. I feel a lot more calm these days, and I think that since the long session has started I feel a lot more useful and busy. Mostly, I am worried about making good friends because I feel like the friends that I left are still my real friends and that I am on some sort of vacation. I want to have a good future at this University with good classes and good friends but I think that I am doubting my ability to succeed. I wish that I could bring the people that I care about around me every once and a while because I did not realize that they were part of the strength that I had to live my life. I think about my grandmothers a lot lately, what they would have said about me being in college, and how they would have wanted me to enjoy myself and not to worry. I think that I am in a constant state of speeding up and slowing down because I do not want to get too excited about something because I may become dissapointed or upset. I think about potential disasters that could occur in my life and am always second guessing the decisions that I make. How can I be the best person that I can be without scaring myself into anxiety. I wonder about all of my friends, and what they feel like, and how they are doing and if they feel the same way. I worry that I will not feel as secure as I did at home in this big place, but I know that if I just give it time, I will feel like I belong. I am constantly aware that God is in control of my life and that I need to learn what God is trying to teach me and lean not on my own understanding of my life. I worry that I sleep to much, but I do not feel tired in the daytime, however I guess that it is necessary to get enough rest. Mostly, I feel void of emotion because I miss my mom so much. I do not feel that I took her for granted when I lived in her house but I miss seeing her persistance, and love and support. I am learning to be my own support. I wonder if she is as lonely without me as I am without her. It was a comfort to be in the house with her at the end because she was feeling much calmer and in control of ther life. I am excited to be here, and I want to count the blessings that I have because of the many people that want to be here. I want to learn to depend on myself, and not feel like the things that I want are not right for me because I am trying to learn that what I want is right for myself. Oftem throughout the day I doubt the things that I do or the feeings that I have,  ",0
"My mind is wandering back and forth between what I want to do and what I need to do. I need to study, read about a dozen chapters out of my textbooks and learn the material inside and out, but I don't want to. I want to just remain calm and lie down on my bed with no worries and no setting of the alarm clock. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I'm actually in a rather uncomfortable state of mind right now, or in reality, I've been in that state of mind since the first day of school. It seems I have lost a lot of my drive and motivation, but I'm trying to gain it back. I want it BACK! Anyway, I am somewhat depressed and sad and I just feel uneasy. I want to be able to give my emotions freely, love in particular, but something always holds me back. Maybe I'm scared, I don't know. What am I going to do with my life? Now that's a question which really needs an answer, but do I have oneno, not me! I am currently a biology major, but I don't know if that is what I want to do. I don't want to go to medical school, but I don't know what else would be really interesting for me. I am very scared that I'm not going to find out what I want to be or should be and then I'm just going to be stuck. Competition is awful, especially between siblings. My brother knows what he wants to do, and I am 100% certain that he will be successful, in fact I know that he would be great at anything he decided to do. That's what I wantI want to know that I'm going to make it without a doubt or hesitation. This is the lack of motivation, inspiration, confidence, or whatever, I was referring to earlier. I use to be very strongwilled and I always set my mind to something and did it. Now, I know I still do that to a certain degree, but not as much, I WANT IT BACKNOW! I'm lonely and tired. I want to find some really good people who I can become really good friends with, but for some reason, I'm really not looking that hard. My social skills have also decided to go into hibernation for a while. Consequently, its my first year at The University of Texas, surrounded by 50,000 people, and I don't even go out of my way to meet new people. That is something that is really starting to bother me, but hopefully as I get more familiar and comfortable with the system and environment everything will end up working out by itself. See normally, my thought would be that I would change and rise to the challenge because that's me, but not now, now I am depending on a nonexistent entity to """"work out by itself. """" Oh well, something needs to change. ",0
"    Sleep! That's what I need to do. I stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on Bond- Born an electric quartet. I asked my roommate that I was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 40 minutes later. I wasn't late. Thank GOD! I'm really stressed out, I have so many things to do this weekend. Why is college so easy yet so hard to manage. Management, I believe, is the biggest thing in college. I miss my family so much. I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and I'm pressing the wrong keys. Grrr! My roommate is leaving today to see her family. Good for her. We were both crying, actually I was the only one come to think of it. She said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever. How can you not cry. I guess I'm very emotional and sensitive. I was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried. I hope they are healthy and son't worry so much. I want to see them and my brothers so bad. I'm done with classes and I'm free!! I love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness. It is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music. I really want to be super good on my electric violin. After writing my paper about the electric quartet, I realized that I wanted to be like them. I actually miss my quartet. They all went to the University of Chicago and are sophomores there. I'm always the youngest in everything. youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at UT. I feel so old yet so young compared to others here. I can't believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class. I was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture. They are older than my professor and TA's. What are they doing here at such a old age, I wonder. Did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! I was walking out of PCL after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money. I ignored him because I was creeped out. It is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he/she should. However, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, I would definetly give them some change. I feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them. Last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that I later found was gay. I really don't mind gay guys although I find it sad, I DO MIND if they are lesbians!! YUCK! I'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things. I am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence. I really want to keep writing on and on but I have 2 minutes left. I love to write especially poems. I like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings. I guess it is because I play classical music and only listen to classical music. Classical music, I think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created. I would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs. I better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go. I'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more. Whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing. Well, I got to head off to my Biology study group. Toodles! ",1
"Right now I'm sitting here at my brothers house. I'm very tired and wish I was in my bed. We had a Tri-Delt meeting tonight and I'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. It just seems like their is something everyday. I wish I could just do some stuff and not all of it. I hate other people having control over me and telling how I have to spend my afternoon. I just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. Maybe I shouldn�t have joined a sorority. Oh well!  I just need a break everything is happening so fast and I'm having second thoughts about the whole Tri-Delt thing because I really don't know anybody yet. Maybe once I start to meet people I feel more comfortable. I'm very excited because my dad is coming to Austin thurs-sunday. He is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. I haven't talked to my dad in awhile so I can't wait to see him. I guess I'm a little homesick or at least more than I let show. I just worry that I/m the only one feeling this way and I don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. But I don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. She is not interested in the same stuff I am and just sits around and plays on the computer. Well enough about that. I'm really hungry but I don�t want to eat anything because I worry about gaining the freshman 15. All my roommate eats is fat fat FAT. So their is all kinds of junk food in my room and I get tempted to eat it. She isn't worried about her weight. I very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. She is real nice and I was surprised that she asked me to live with her. I said yes but I will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. Last night was the weirdest thing I set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. This was the first time that I had the chance since I've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. I even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that I was with them. It was just two months ago. I wish I was back their right now because I had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. Well it has been 20 min. so I guess I'll let you go. Got to go study!!!!! ",1
"I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if I�m just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because Austin is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate Texas. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 7 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 65 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell can�t I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think I�ll just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. ",1
"I have done this twice now and erased it both times. I wish I could do it on a different program but my computer is broken and I don't exactly know how to use my neighbors that is letting me borrow hers. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately. I guess I'm finally realizing that I'm here for good. I'm used to going on long trips in the summer so I know what it's like to be away from home and my mom and dad but this is so different. It feels like it's a point with no return. Even if I live with them during the summer which is a possibility it won't ever be the same. The days of grade school at home are over. I really miss my mom. She is my best friend. Really though so is my dad and my brother Seth. It is amazing how close we are. I feel so fortunate. In my marriage and family class we talked about a healthy and strong family and I feel like my family met most all of the items on the list. We have so many memories together. I'm so lucky to have my brother. My brother's good friend died when they were in 10th grade. It was the hardest thing ever for our youth group at church. I miss my church so much. It is such a home to me. My best friends are from my church. It is so sad that I will never be in a youth group again as a youth. I ay end up going on trips as a sponsor or something but it will never be the same. I'm at somewhat of peace with the change but it still makes me sad when I realize the little things like not having to rush around on Sundays in order to be back for choir, supper, and bible study. The things that can drive you crazy are the things you miss. I miss my cat. He is so old. I remember when he was a tiny baby in 1988. He find us and adopted us. We named him Kitty Duke after Michael Dukakis' wife who we were voting for that year (it was Election time) but soon found that he was a he so we changed it to Duke. Everyone says that it sounds like a big dog's name but oh well. He is an orange tabby cat. It seems like he used to be fatter but maybe I've just gotten bigger. We've been through a lot. W e used to play together all the time. I'd sing to him when he was a baby. Without my brother I would be such a different person. He has helped form me in so many ways. He is my hero. I think the world of him. I didn't always though, like when he would hit me on the head or do """"gross"""" things in my face as a normal big brother should do. But I'm very lucky to be so close to him. I try not to talk about him around Caitlyn, Jake's little sister. When he died she was in 4th grade. They were so close. I remember it all like it was yesterday. Getting the call at 6 the next morning. I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group. I talked to Catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade. She broke down one night in Montana when we were on mission tour. We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings. She just broke down which was a first. I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about Seth around her because Jake and him were the same age. She said that she loved hearing about Seth but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly. She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it. My brother is getting married this summer. It is so strange. I love Lauren. She is already just like my sister. They have been together for four years now. At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother's best friend. I soon realized that we had very different places in Seth's life and that there is room for both of us. I have Seth' past and we both have his future. My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east Texas and have the best time. Seth and I would play so hard. On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream. Seth would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods. It's funny what a family thinks is so humorous that would mean nothing to others. On the way down he would always try to explain the wonders of the earth to my mom and me like the stars and solar system and physics and things that Ginny and Anne Claire Hickman would probably never grasp. That's one thing I adore about my family. We all contribute different things. We are so different but so alike. I miss days of being with just us. We always traveled a lot. I think I'm just trying to let go of that time in my life right now. With me leaving for college and Seth getting married, it's a whole new chapter. We have the best traditions. Even food traditions like Chicken and Cheese soup on Christmas Eve and Asparagus on Easter. I hope to start traditions with my own family. I miss my room, my bed, my church, the familiarity of Ft. Worth roads, my boyfriend Blake and his house and my best friends from church. Blake would be a fantastic husband and father. I always say that if I don't marry him than I'll marry someone just like him. I wonder how my parents came up with our traditions. Like every Christmas Eve, Seth and I open one present, an ornament. Mine are always angels and his are always bears. Eventually we added my mom and dad with cats and Santa's. My mom doesn't even like cats. When she was little her dad expected her to like the animals and be near them so I think that's why she doesn't like them. They had a farm. She hated her dad. I can't imagine. When we drive to Oklahoma to see my grandmother, we always have very soul bearing conversations, some of our best in fact. She would always tell me about her childhood because I was so interested. Her dad was so difficult. In two weekends we're all going to Duncan, Ok. My uncle is coming in from Florida so we all are driving in. It will be great. I'm very close to my cousins and I really don't see them that often at all. At Thanksgiving when we were little we used to all cram into my Grandmother's house and each get one kernel of corn at our place which represented one thing we were thankful for. We each said it aloud before we ate. Another great tradition. ",1
"I'm writing a stream of consciousness paper, yeah! well, my friend John is sitting next to me submitting his calculus homework. I'm wondering if I will have more success when I submit mine. John's a good guy but never helps out with calculus. some friend. I wish that this thing was over. 20 minutes is looking like a long time. I didn't think twenty minutes could be so long. I guess it's all relativity. If I was on a beach in cancun 20 minutes would go by in the blink of an eye. but here, no. I'm hear for eternity, or twenty minutes whichever comes first. the internet is down in my room so I have to use this damn facility at the base of my dorm, man this sucks. the damn airwave guy was supposed to come down and take care of the internet problem but it turns out he doesn't give a rat's ass about the internet or my calculus or my stream of consciousness, man he sucks big time. keep thinking about Trina wonder what she is doing. wonder how many guys she is been with since rejecting me. damn, stay positive, it's the only way to get through boring times. shouldn't smoke anymore either. smoking's bad and yet it's so damn good. man good thing I don't smoke or I might be enjoying a good nicotine buzz right now. what's the deal with hannah anyway? I mean I'm not attracted to her anymore because she reaks of desperation I mean that bugs me. why does she always have to guilt trip me, fooling around with her is like a full time job. wish I could have gone to jack in the box even though that food will make me fat. hannah said that food would make her fat. maybe we're both right. I hate the cafeteria food here. today I couldn't stomach any of it. got to make a check out to tom for 25 dollars for the ceiling fans that weren't even put in the right way. that dude with the messed up teeth installed the improperly  the first time anyway, they almost crushed john and marissa. what a shit weekend, john had someone to do and I didn't haha. clever pun. clever reminds me of that one girl I met at the ATO house and we talked macbeth and I got her number but that didn't stop her from not returning my calls, I need to find some way to get a flask into the football games that way the buzz doesn't wear off and I can keep on buzzing baby. yeah I remember the time on this very computer I walked by and some Australian dude was looking at the most obscene porn I've ever seen in my life. I wonder what everyone else's stream of consciousness papers look like. I wonder if mine is ore or less neurotic than everyone else. I really should get a girlfriend like my sweet mate tom the golden boy. he is the golden boy because he wins at fucking everything. smart, good looking, athletic, in a word I hate his guts. but I don't really he is my friend I just wish the playing field was a little more even so that I could get some females for whatever reason. the guy is so lucky, he is rich and he doesn't really have to make grades in college and he has enough money to join a fucking frat and it pisses me off because the frat guys wanted me too but I have neither the money nor the time with school because some of us have to make the grade just to get a decent job and make a little money. I thought college would be so cool, but it absolutely sucks. I mean, why did I have this delusion that college would be so damn great, it's just like high school. which was just like middle school with cars. man, life is truly what you make of it. On the one hand you got fewer people hassling you, on the other hand you have a lack of support. man I wish we hadn't got cable in our room, now I especially don't want to study, I need mary jus t called me. better not answer. she is kinda weird, maybe she got an OU UT wristband, yeah well, sorry I didn't get you your I'D mary, you shouldn't have left it over here. I wish I had a car and also some more socks because when you've got socks you don't have to do as much laundry. Jessica simpson is such a bitch, all through middle school me and my friends would have killed to get some"""" from her. but now that she has that new show on mtv that's all reality and stuff I realize what an absolute hose beast she is, man she sucks big time well its getting near the end of this I wonder where the research page is so I can get some credit hours and not fail the damn class. I suppose that 's it 3 v sorry dude I only signed up for twenty. ",0
"I am so pissed right now because I was almost done and then my sweetmate's phone rang and I got disconnected and now I am just hoping that the phone doesn't ring again, I would like to get this done before the weekend begins. I am very excited about this weekend I think that it is going to be alot of fun. We are doing many things, let's see. Tonight we are going to Hillele first, which is a religious service (Jewish). Those are always nice,. Hillel reminds me of camp which I love. I go to a religious overnight camp in Wisconsin, Ramah. In my last letter I was wondering if anyone is even reading this, maybe you are just checking that we did this and that's it. I mean, it has to be incredibly boring to read 500 of these. although, as a psychologist maybe it is totally interesting, you get to analyze all of us. Those surveys well, I thought they were sort of pointless, just because as the teacher said (or you said if you are reading it), the research is meaningless if the patient knows what is being tested. It's not that I knew the hypothesis for all the surveys but they were pretty obvious and I could tell what the researchers were looking for. I like psychology so far though, I don't know if I am going to agree with everything though. I will have to see, but a friend of mine told me that it gets very logical and I am not the biggest supporter of logic. That must sound very stupid, well, that's not exactly what I mean, but I read this book, actually a short story, Teddy by JD Salinger, who I love and Teddy said you have to look at the world without logic to understand things better. He said that when Eve bit in the apple, she was really biting into logic. This seems very long, I have been writing for a while I also think I should stop because I am very nervous that the phone ",1
"Okay, I'm starting. I did assignments like this in freshman English back in high school. It was pretty cool. Mrs. Johnson was a great English teacher, but she scared me sometimes, like when she would yell at one of the kids in class to prove a point about what we were learning in class. I really liked that class. I liked the books we read. We were reading Huckleberry Finn, and one of her points she made was over censorship, she took the book away from us. We couldn't even go to the school library to finish it. I guess she got her point across. Another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment, you can get it done. Before we read Animal Farm, she split us up into groups, sheep, pigs, dogs, chicken, and we had to have a campaign. This just wasn't any campaign, we really had to work for it. Make up slogans, flyers, songs, costumes, bribes. you name, we were graded on it. We were allowed to decorate all the halls with our flyers. It became really big, Mrs. Johnson and her campaigns. It just kept getting bigger every year. I guess you could say the incoming freshman were getting crazier each year. I didn't really care, each year that went by was closer to me getting away from there. I can't stand it back home. I knew everybody in my school, and they all knew me, so tell my how I ended up with only a handful of people who would talk with me during lunch. I wasn't rude to people. least I don't think I was. Oh, well, I'll never see most of those people again in my life. Yippee! No, that's not the least bit sarcastic. I think sarcasm is a certain type of humor. Only certain people can do it, and only certain people think it's funny. I had to deal with sarcasm all the time in my family. I don't understand how some people say they come from a broken family. Your family doesn't necessarily have to be split up to feel like you've come from a dysfunctional family. I have to live with what my father does, and so does my mom and brother. Big deal, we make it through one day at a time. Like today, I just stopped worrying and went to a concert. It was pretty cool, although I wish I'd gone with someone who wanted to go up into the mosh pits. I know they're dangerous, but, come one, they're fun and you get to get close to the bands. I also went to a concert on Friday night. That one was cooler. The lead band was so cool. The singer was dancing around stage so crazily. It was a really neat experience for me. Only seven more minutes to go. No, I'm not counting. There goes that sarcasm again. Once, for junior English, my teacher had us try what Benjamin Franklin did to better himself, keep a record of all our vises and try to improve upon them. Guess which one was my weak point? Yep, sarcasm and meanness. I can't help it, it's in my nature. I'm not a mean person, I just see things sometimes in a mean way. And you have to voice it, otherwise it just stays inside and festers and then you do become mean. Right? At least that's my superstition. I don't normally go in for superstitions, but this one sounds good for me. Oh, and I say 'Bless you' when someone sneezes, I think it's just polite, I don't believe in the scaring the demons away. I think that's a bunch of bullshit. Man, I can't wait to graduate. I really want to fly helicopters. That's what I'm going to do when I get out of college. Go into the Navy and fly helicopters. It should be really neat. I know neat isn't quite the word I'm looking for, but somehow, I don't think awesome would be appropriate in a paper I'm turning in for a grade, even though you're not going to read it. ",0
"I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. Alessandra, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. Shelley and Liz are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see Jordan, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where Benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where Kevin Costner's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with Shelley, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to Shelley and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 3rd floor. We started talking about Alex's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw Alex's ring (which is her grandmothers, Joe did not buy it), Shelley told me that it was 1. 7 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose Alex either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. Jordan just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, Alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 30,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with Joe for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with Jordan now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in New York, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   ",1
"I don't have to right in paragraph form or write any sentence structures or even spell right. I don't have to put any grammar or punctuation on this assignment and I can talk about anything. I don't understand what the point of this assignment is and I don't care as long as I finish it. So I guess I'll just keep typing and typing and typing. Right now, I feel an itch so I'll scratch my arm. I'm typing on my friends computer, so he can't use it for at least another seventeen minutes. I don't think understand the point of this assignment. I could do this: and nobody would care. This assignment is just to type for twenty minutes about whatever I think and I keep thinking this over and over again. I don't know what I'm doing and I don't care as long as I finish. I started at 2:28p. M so I'll stop at 2:48p. M. Man it's another fifteen minutes until I finish. I'm tired and I want to go back to sleep. I need to do my laundry, clean the bathroom, do my homework. That reminds me I have so much homework to do. I don't understand anything in calculus and I'm worried about that class. My final is fifty percent of my grade!!!!  I don't understand why some teachers would do that. It's like the semester grade depends on this one test. If you were making an A in the class, before the final, you could end up failing if you really screw up on the final. What kind of class is that???  I don't know but I'm scared. I have to study hard for that final, but first I have to understand the material we're covering right now. I'm so behind. But the good thing about the final is that it's my only final and I have a week to study for it so I should do O. K. I hope I get a B in this class. I don't want to do any homework, and that reminds me that I'm behind in all of my classes!!!!  I have to read so much and I don't like to read. I think I'm going crazy. I need to write this assignment do the second writing assignment, read for Theatre, do Calculus homework, read for this class, do a peer review sheet for English, and chores around the house. So much to do, so little time. Only 9 more minutes to go. Oh, and the pretest survey to see what surveys I will be used in, was messed up. I didn't start reading the top of the survey which tells you what answers to fill in until the middle. So I think the survey thinks I'm a girl, since I answered some FEMALE ONLY questions. Except I checked the male box when it asked whether I was male or female. But it kept on asking me questions that were very feminine. I hope I don't get in trouble for that. But I doubt it, since there will probably be other people who will do the exact same thing I did. There's always somebody else. I hope I don't get put into some strange category or something. What I didn't understand about the survey was that why did it ask some of the same questions over again. I think it had to do something with me answering FEMALE ONLY questions. I don't know if that's why but I answered most all of them except this one question that asked if I was more guilty about eating than most girls. I was like: """"Hold up, what's going on?  This survey thinks I'm a girl!""""  Damn, well whatever it's O. K. everybody makes mistakes and I'm not going to come down on myself because of that. My friends staring at my assignment right now and saying this is an easy assignment. Well I guess it is, it's just that my fingers are tired. I don't want to type anymore, and I have 2 more minutes left. Yippee!!!!  After this I'm going to take a break and then do writing assignment number 2. After I finish that I'll take a nap and start on Calculus. Oh man, so much work to do!!! I should have started earlier instead of playing these first few weeks of school. Well my time's up. So goodbye!!! ",1
"For some reason I am very tired. Ever since I have been up here I always feel tired. Some days I don't do very much so it does not make sense for me to be very tired. I also get very bored sometimes. I can think of absolutely nothing to do. I wish I had my computer so I could save this so later I can see what I wrote. I thought I would be doing more and going more places when I got up here. My friends that I am always with up here are not very active and exciting. I miss my best friend a lot. I don't miss home, just the people there. I also miss my very, very good friend who goes to school in Indiana. I miss him so much. I think about him all of the time. I miss him more and more each day. He is just my friend, so I don't know what is wrong with me. We became a little closer over the summer. Some people that I know think that we should date. I don't know. I think I might like him, but I sometimes feel that I shouldn't. I don't know. I miss him so much. I worry about him all the time. I also worry about my brother and my sister very much. Hopefully, I will get to visit Justin in Indiana for Thanksgiving. However, he might come home. I really hope that he does come home. If I go up there I will get to see real snow. I like it up there very much. I don't know why. I have been twice. I really like his friends up there. They are great guys. We have lots of fun together. All the guys who go to his school are gentlemen. I have told myself that if I don't like it here this year that I will transfer next year. But, I love it here, even though I get bored sometimes. I love Texas. Justin hates it for some reason. He thinks I should transfer to a college near Indiana. I have thought about it. The only thing is that I like it here. If something goes wrong I might transfer. I would love to be closer to him, but anything I have ever done for a guy has turned out bad. One should only do things for oneself and one should only listen to their own heart. I'm not sure what my heart is telling me to do, yet. See, I need to quit thinking about him so much and concentrate more on school and studying. This is what I came to college for. To study and learn, not in search of a relationship. I need to remember to go to Mezes and sign up for experiments. I wish we didn't have to do that, but it is much better than writing a 5 page paper. I have never been able to write research papers well. I can write stories and essays well. Oh! I just finished the best book ever. It is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I love it so much. I think Jane Austen is my new favorite author. I am now reading Emma by Jane Austen. It seems like it will be a great book, also. I think 20 minutes are over. It sure did go by rather quickly. Bye!

"okay I�m writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if I�ll get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope I�m not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 12:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I don�t want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school I�m looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that I�m in a sorority, not that I�m not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean I�m no longer Lindsey (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so I�d rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 12:07 boy I�ve never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if I�ll be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still haven�t attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 12 and I�m not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because I�ve risen before 10:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 8 hours of sleep I�m one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if I�m wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, I�m so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that I�m off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and I�m signing off!

"I am beginning to write this assignment and I'm thinking that is a pretty big waste of time. I'm already bored and I don't like it. I can smell the bread I got at la madelines and it smells pretty good. I don't normally eat there so it was a treat and I was there with a good friend so it was pretty fun. my friend/roommate just flushed the toilet and I think it sucks down pretty hard. alright only eighteen minutes to go. the more I smell the bread the more I want to eat it. it smells really good. the tv is on right now and it is on mtv, the voice of our generation. I was watching a show on christina aguilara and realized how gorgeous she really was when she dresses normally. man I'm hungry!  I got to say I want to pierce my lip. the more I think about it the more I want to do it. I think it would so cool. and I want a tattoo. too bad my dad is anal about stuff like that. oh well, one of these days. we better beat the hell out of arkansas next saturday or I'll be pissed. my friend made me laugh because he heard this commercial for the dumbest movie ever, malibu's most wanted. I could go for some cereal. my mom's in europe on a cruise right now. queer eye for the straight guy is the dumbest excuse for television ever. what a waste of time that was. they don't even dress like straight guys. they are really gay and there style sucks. jimmy fallon is a funny guy I met him in new york. it is weird how peoples minds drift. I wish I could be a professional assassin. not even a ninja assassin, just one with a cool silenced gun. I don't know why. it just seems cool. to take care"""" of evil men. like in the boondock saints, the greatest movie ever. I hope I get to run track in the spring and I make the team. that would be like a dream come true. I would be a college athlete. that would be neat. and all the ladies love that. I think music is a great thing. I hope I find a bassist for my man while I'm here and we can play a show here at emo's. this is taking a lot longer than I thought it would. beyonce knowles is a good looking' woman. I don't know why she likes jay-z. to be famous would be nice, but to be a doctor would be nicer because I earned that. good charlotte sucks. they are terrible live and I don't get why people like them. the guitarist isn't even good. I'm half way done. that is nice to know. my mind is being strained. the texans one today and they beat the dolphins. that is awesome because some thought the dolphins would win the super bowl. we'll see about that. texas football rules. my old high school one its first game of the season yesterday and they did well. my little brother one his first high school of his career and he was pretty proud. He is on the a team and that is a big deal. blah blah, that is what my mind thinks. its neat to see what people can think of. I need to buy some milk for my room. I could go fro some cocoa-cocoa dyno bytes. they are so good, and chocolaty. mmmmmm. delicious. instant messaging is an interesting concept in these connected times of ours. that would suck to be a worm. have no legs and what not, I need to get xp for my computer so I have word, excell and power point. that would be nice. only six minutes to go. I don't know why people love asses so much. its kinda gross when people think about what they really are. chris rock is pretty find. he just has a really big mouth and I'm surprised he hasn't gotten beaten up. it was jack black's birthday not too long ago and he is really funny. I just started showing my friend how to play the guitar and she is doing pretty well. probably because she knows how to play the violin. david blaine is the most amazing street magician ever. the olsen twins are worth over a billion dollars. rock music is the best sort of music because I can get into it more I think. rap isn't real music. just like good charlotte. I like evanescence because that girl is hot and linkin park is good because they are different. the white stripes suck however because that girl can't drum to save her life. it is interesting to see how people interact. I don't know why. maybe that is why I want to be a psychiatrist. I'm trying to spell correctly on this and I don't know why. maybe so you can understand what is being typed on this crazy assignment. linkin park won the best rock video award. it was interesting. I don't know why. that band has a lot of asians in it. metallica is a well received band because they are good. I could never be a typical rock star because I can't think I could be that mean to people. ",1
"I think college is going to be the best part of my life. Coming from my high school, it seemed hopeless to find a place where I'd fit in. UT has such a wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people, that I think, I will have no problem finding someone like me. Of course, right now, I'm still a little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change. I really want to join a soroity and become active in as many Hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow. Maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me. Even though I only know a couple of people on campus, I feel more comfortable there than I ever did in high school.          Outside of school, things are good at home. I have all the love and support than I can ever ask for from my family. Without them I don't know where I'd be. I love them very much. I don't know why I can't tell them that. I guess I'm just too stubborn. I also get a lot of support from my boyfriend. Even though I didn't really want a boyfriend, I'm glad he's there. He brings a lot of fun to my life. I hope school doesn't take away my time for him. I know its going to though, ecspecially if I join all the organizations that I want.            Overall,I'm satisfied with everything. I know its going to be a long and hard four years, but I'm looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major.           ",0
"I live in Amarillo and I can't exactly drive home to see them. I envy the people in my dorm who only live a few hours away from home. They can visit their friends and family on every weekend or weekday for that matter. I feel a little guilty because I miss my friends more than I miss my family. Maybe that is because I had a better relationship with my friends than I did with my family. this is probably because I spent a lot more time with my friends during the past few years. It seemed I felt empty if I didn't see my friends for a day, but I could go weeks without seeing my family and I'd feel just fine. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, and I do feel slightly homesick, but I have a stronger relationship withe my friends. Whenever I spent """"quality time"""" with my folks, all we would do would sit on the couch in the living room and watch Seinfeld; we would never talk, but it really wasn't their fault. Whenever I would feel like talking about something important that was on my mind, they wouldn't have a problem with it, but I would feel awkward. It has always been that way, so it's not some kind of """"teenager"""" thing that just kind of happened during my rebellious years. My parents are the greatest, and so are my three brothers. I have one older brother that is about to turn 20, so the age difference is pretty narrow. We used to do things all the time when we were younger, but now we hardly talk at all. I also have two younger brothers, 8 and 14 who are also great, but they're not so easy to talk to. My brother, Kyle, who is 14, has a lot of problems I think. He doesn't have any friends and he always just stays home and watches tv and plays video games. When I ask him how his day was, he just says fine, and thats all the conversation really consists of. I couldn't really talk to him because I felt so sorry for him. I also worry about my mom because she loses sleep trying to find ways to help him. My youngest brother, on the other hand, has plenty of energy and self-confidence and a lot of friends. I think he'll be one of the """"popular guys"""" in school, and I feel bad when my little 8 year old brother can outdo my 14 year old brother Kyle. I also try to think up ways to raise Kyle's self confidence, but I'm really not much of a help. I find myself making fun of him unconciosly just like many big brothers all do, but I really feel bad about it. I sometimes know how he feels because in junior high I didn't always have five or ten friends to hang out and talk with, and I sometimes found myself at home on the weekends feeling like a loser, but I eventually found my place and my friends in high school, and I hope that's what he does when he goes to high school next year. He is old for his grade because he was held back in the first grade, and he has some kind of a learning problem and when I try to help hime with his school work he gets embarrassed and won't let me. I just really hopes he finds his place in high school or if not, in college, like many people do. so, maybe I should spend more time with my family when I get home in a few monthes instead of with my friends ",1
"Right now I am not stressed and I feel very comfortable. However, I feel like I should be thinking of ways of obtaining a scholarship so I can help my parents out. I guess you can say that I feel kind of guilty. I mean putting two kids through college is no joke. I guess I have been pretty preoccupied with that during my entire stay at UTAustin. Overall I like the campus. Most of the parties and events that I want to attend are off campus, but that does not keep me from having fun. The people are generally nice here. That was really unexpected, because most of the people at my high school usually considered themselves superior to the rest of the people. I wouldn't say that my high school years were the best because it was not. However I think that I could have made it better. However, now that I am in college, I feel that I can start my life all over again. All those mistakes that I made in high school are gone and I can try to learn from them. (Such as waiting until the night before a major exam to study) I think that college will definitely teach me how to balance my time. I am glad that my parents decided not to let me work because I do not know how I could have adjusted. However I know that I will have to work at some time during the school year. Hopefully I will be able to handle it. I am pretty much worried about my classes and what grades I will get in them. So far it has not been so bad. I know that the worst is yet to come. Preparedness is not one of my stronger assets. I tend to be flustered and nervous most of the time. A young woman that I knew from high school told me that the important thing to do in college is not to stress. Hopefully I will live up to that. I can't promise anything. I still feel upset that I did not get any type of scholarship. I felt that I worked hard, but then again there are a lot of intelligent young people on this campus and not all of them obtained scholarships. So in other words, I don't feel as bad as I used to.

"I have too much homework to do. It is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours. The homework in UT requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time. Also, at UT, you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management. Also, there are a lot of distractions like girls, basketball, sleep, etc. Going to early classes has been hard for me so far. It is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it. I think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about, or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand. This is because once you are lost, you really don't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed. I really think that my GPA is important this semester becuase I am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science. This is becuase I do not like computer science which is my current major, and business seems easier and a better track to go. Today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection. It kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student's number really was. I want my parents to bring me a bike to UT. It is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes. But I kind of don't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair, you will have to pedal over hills, and cars don't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians. I am kind of pissed that the school is closing Gregory Gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party. I think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night. Plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too. I really think that the UT football team is going to do well this year. Although they blew a big first game, I think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year. I don't understand why Chris Simms chose to come to Texas over Tennessee. He is such a good quarterback to be a backup. I think he should be starting over Major Applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic. I really don't like to do these things because it takes so much time. When I first started typing I didn't realize how long 20 minutes is, but it is a long time. When I finish this, I need to start on my english paper, and do my calculus problems. My calculus TA is really stupid because she cannot teach us. She skips too many steps, and she can't explain problems very well. I think that radio stations should not have morning shows. This is because I was listening to a radio station in the morning that didn't use to have a morning show because they were new, but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music. Also, they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to. I like it when it rains. But here in Austin is never seems to rain. I've been here for 2 1/2 weeks now and not a drop of rain. When it rains I feel better for some reason. Tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because I don't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon. And all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you don't learn anything. I like a girl here are UT but I don't know if she likes me back. But I am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to Emory in Atlanta. The girl that I like in UT though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that I am there. She also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous. The girl in Emory is a girl that I've known for 4 years and I think I stand a better chance with her, but I hear that long distance realtionships never work out. ",0
"I'm in my roomate's room right now, since my computer is not hooked up to the internet yet. I never realized how little she does. She has a piece of paper, apparently meant to be a homework assignment, but it's covered with the most random, 1st grade-type drawings I've ever seen. She obviously put a lot of effort into this. I guess she was trying to avoid doing her assignment. This room is a mess. I can't wait until my computer's working. I haven't checked my e-mail in a while. I guess I should do that, seeing as how I'm expecting scholarship information. I really need some more money, preferably free money. It'd be nice to not have to work for once in my life. Not like my parents help me. Thye have better things to spend it on, like my spoiled-rotten older sister who can't fend for herself because she's never had to. I wish I could call Mom evry month and tell her how much money I'll be needing this month to survive. It's pretty ridiculoous when you have to give plasma for food. I need to just file for independence, I basically support myself anyways. I'm actually thinking about getting my wisdom teeth pulled at one of those labs that tests anesthetics on you. I'm supposed to pay for it myself, but how the hell am I going to afford that?  Rent's coming up and I haven't even received all my financial aid money yet. Oh, well. Maybe I can somehow either win the lotto or get discovered. I'm going to a modeling contest in a week. Hopefully thing will go well there. I really need to get out of Texas. My boyfriend Brad lives 3 hours away in west Texas. He's supposed to start playing college football again in the Spring. There's going to be draft people there form the NFL. That'd be pretty cool too, except that if he moved to a different state, he'd want me to go with him. I'm not sure I want to succeed in getting out of here through him. Stephanie, my roommate, has some of my stuff in here. That kind of pisses me off. I don't take her shit. my other roommate Yoshi owes me $50 dollars. I need it for my psychology book (ironic, isn't it?). I found out yesterday that he owes all his friends money, almost $1000 total. I don't think I'm going to be seeing that money anytime soon. I don't get payed for another week, and my job pays crap. I want to get a new job, one that actually pays me decently, but unfortunately, I love my shitty job. I graduate in 1 1/2 years if things go right. That is, if I can get into the Psychology Dept. (once again, ironic). Why is Psychology the only major in Lberal Arts that I actually have to apply for?  I could've have gotten in easily when I first applied for school if I had known what I wanted to do. Oh, well, not much I can do about it now. I've missed way too many classes already, and it's only the 3rd week. I've never been sick in my life, and now my immune system decides to go on a vacation. I wonder if my parents realize that I'm probably never going to talk to them again after I graduate?  I know if I mean that or not. Sometomes I think I do. I don't think soomeone going to school full-time should ever be burdened as much as I am by financial responsibilities. It's jsut not right when, according to everything I've applied for, they make too much money. ",0
"I have watching Comedy Central for the past hour or so. The program involved people getting paid not to laugh while listening to comedians. If I were one of those people paid not to laugh, I wouldn't pay attention to the actual words the comedians was saying. Listening to the skit would most likely make me laugh, so I would think of something else. I would discuss with myself something really boring, so as not to laugh. Speaking of boring, I received two letters today from my boyfriend. He was talking about being bored in class. He attends A&M, the idiot. My parents don't know he's my boyfriend. They think he's just my best friend since that's what we were all last year. My sister, whose computer I'm using, doesn't know either. I hope she doesn't read anything I'm writing here. If she did, I'm not so sure she wouldn't tell my parents. My mother loves my boyfriend, but I don't think she or my father would let me visit him at A&M if they knew he was more than just my friend. Otherwise, I would love to tell them. They would be so happy for both of us, seeing as how they love him. I just want to be able to have him visit me and me visit him without my parents wondering why we're visiting each other. Plus, my parents are quite protective. I don't know how their attitudes towards him would change if they knew. All of my past boyfriends have been introduced to them only after we became boyfriend and girlfriend. My past boyfriends were very different from my current boyfriend. Their outlook on life, intelligence level, looks, interests, and families were exact opposites from his. He's exceptionally smart, and I'm not just saying that because he's my boyfriend. He loves Einstein, his theories, and computers. My old boyfriends loved roller blading, and non-intelligent ways of spending an evening, if you know what I mean. My boyfriend actually listens when I talk to him. He will also talk if I ask him a question. He doesn't lie to me, which is a big change. In fact, we spend most of our time together just talking about differing interesting things. You would think we would run out of things to say, but there is always more. We've had these talks for at least nine months and still have more to talk about. I can actually see spending the rest of my life with him. I can't believe I just said that. I never thought I'd be able to say that about anyone. Wow, I'm impressed. He's one of the closest things to my heart. It's weird actually talking about this. For the longest time, I didn't want anyone that close. Now it's kind of comforting. Oh boy, I have been typing for quite a while now. Sorry. Bye, and have fun reading this and delving into my soul. ",0
"I'm in the computer lab upstairs. I don't know what to write. there are a lot of people here. the computer next to me is broken but I don't know how. the guy who was sitting there earlier was kinda cute in a nerdy sort of way. some guy just walked behind me. there was a loud noise just now. don�t know what it was though. kinda scared me cause I thought I did something wrong and the people who control the computers would come after me and make me pay a million dollars for the entire system. wow the girl next to me got a long email. I got a few emails today. why do people wear socks with sandals?  don't they know it doesn't look good?  the computer screen is huge. I bet you a million dollars that this is the stupidest writing assignment you will get back from a student. I don't really measure up to the rest of the class. wow the girl next to me is typing really slowly. I'm in the I section. how come on some computers I and l look the same and they also look like 1. ewwwwww that girl should NOT be wearing something so tight. I've been at this computer for a long time. how come there are so many blonde people here. I wouldn't want to have yellow hair. I want headphones so I can listen to music. I'll bring them next time. I'd do this from my room, but I don't have my Ethernet set up because the computer store doesn't have any software there. recycling is weird. why don't they make it a law that you have to recycle. and if you don't recycle, you get fined like a million dollars. why do people read when they should log onto their computer?  I mean, there are TONS of people waiting to use computers and then you have people like this who read instead of type. why do people sit at booths in the cafeteria alone?  don't they have common sense?  a booth is not for one person. it's for more than one person. that's why there are tables everywhere. so you can eat at tables alone in the corner instead of taking up a whole booth alone. there should be a law against that. I�d enforce it. Emily's boyfriend's name is Steve. that's my boyfriend's name. only her boyfriend is close by. mine is far. it's sad. she's going to go out with me and her boyfriend this weekend. she's gonna have sex with him.

I�ll study after that. I wanna party. I drank too much coke today. i want water. I�m hungry. man it's cold here. how come my room is so cold?  I want to change the temp but then it might be too hot. every place is freezing here and it's hot as hell outside. is hell a bad word?  why do people think it's bad?  and why is God Damn so bad?  you can say ass on TV but not god damn?  and who decided it was bad anyway?  I wrote a high school essay about it one time but I have no idea. why are bad words bad words?  who decided they were bad. I want glasses.

I skipped class today. don't know why. I was lazy. I need to shape up or ship out. I never liked that phrase. who wants to ship out?  how can you ship out?  we're all on land. not at sea.

"I'm pretty stressed out right now, I just have to get this paper out of the way so I can start on my other 615 hours of homework. What is going through my mind right now, hmmm I haven't called home enough. I've skipped Biology too many times, but I still need an A. I think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. I can get through it though. What is going on in my mind right now?? Actually, I'm thinking I need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. I have a date tomorrow night with a girl that I hardly know, but she was cute enough I don't know what I think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. How is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. A date is not necessary for every single event, especially when I am dressed up as Country Club Ken (by choice of course). I just heard from someone that this socalled hot date I have has some personal issues. What is that supposed to mean? No one would go into detail, just that she had issues. She could be a bulimic head case for all I know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. I have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. I'm worried about my roommate. He acts strait but every once in a while I catch him staring at me when I get out of the shower. Now that I think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. In class, that is when I can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl I saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. There is one good looking girl on my floor that I keep going back to, I winder if she has issues as well. I have been to her room a couple of times, but I can't decide if it could happen or not, I do not like to go for things unless I am absolutely positive she will say yes. Maybe I think about girls too much, but I am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. How in the world does that always happen to me once I get on my own, I could always manage money at home, but the day I moved up here it just disappeared and now I am already left with hardly nothing. People always told me that, but I never listened. ",1
"Stream of Consciousness that term reminds me so much of Virginia Woolf and my long semester studying her and Mrs. Dalloway. I can't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how Mrs. Dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad. I feel so bad for her. I wonder how fast twenty minutes really is I bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but I guess it is kind of interesting I just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing. I am so glad that it is Labor Day weekend and I am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and I guess some studying too although that won't be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal. it is so interesting how I am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and I some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that I can concentrate on just about anything. I hope this year goes well because I think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year I if The semester goes well. I'm getting kind of sad now that because I am leaving town tomorrow I am going to miss the first Football which will be my first Texas football game and I have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun, but at least there are plenty of other games that I can attend. My hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering I haven't even typed for 10 minutes. I wonder if I am missing out on anything while I am sitting her typing this but I guess it isn't that big of a deal I don't think there are many people her anyway and I don't know where anyone is. I was thinking about how when I graduated from high school that I would be balling my eyes out but I didn't cry then I thought I would cry when My parents left me here all alone. but the weird thing is I haven't cried or anything yet I haven't even gotten homesick. I mean let's face it isn't like I would have anything spectacular to do even if I was home so I guess that helps in the homesickness department. It is so cold in my room I am absolutely freezing and There is no way in which to control the air, I need gloves and winter boots. I really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings I mean I know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat, but then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like I am surprised I haven't gotten frost bite from these frigid places. Well the time has actually gone faster than I expected it to it hasn't been all that bad once I got over the whole Virginia Woolf suicide and her book that I had to suffer through and analyze. It has actually been kind of fun I mean all I have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how I am feeling and that isn't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you write because personally I Don't' want everyone in the world to know how I feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part. I am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best. that is real comfort food. Wow I am beginning to feel hungry now but I don't know for what also I really need these twenty minutes to over so that I can run and go get a drink I am really thirsty. oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer. but hey I don't have to type for too much longer.

"This is the psychology writing assignment. I hear people talking and I do not like what they are saying I have so much to do today, and I've already done so much. what am I going to do when I get home. I think I'm hungry but I don't feel faint like usual. I want to talk to matt about things but then again he just gets upset. more talking that I don't want to hear. there is training going on and he seems to be annoyed with the guy. like I'm annoyed. I wonder if carol has written me back. this is actually a weird assignment, but very easy, my fingers are getting tired because I type quite fast. I know I have some mistakes but I doubt the professor cares. I met some guy in class the other day. his name is, well I shouldn't tell you the name. he draws stuff. that reminds me he gave me a website to go visit and I don't have it with me. that's a bummer, huih? I wonder what bill is doing. I shouldn't be thinking about him, I should be thinking about mat. matt matt matt. I know that guy that just walked in. he was in my mis class and he was annoying. why do I keep saying that word. annoying annoying annoying in my head. I'm really not like that and it's only been 3 minutes writing. what if someone can't type very well and they do this assignment. their brain processes stuff faster than what they are typing. I bet they would only get a few lines out before time was up. what is the point of this experiment. I would like to know professor! anyhow I'm still hungry I just want to vedge out because I've been at school all day long and it's already 7:10 in the evening. I want to go home but I'd rather not ride the bus. you know this morning the bus was so crowded. stop talking man! I want you to shut up. this guy is always in the computer lab. he mentioned that he went to college but never managed to graduate and now he works here. I don't know what I think about that. At first I felt sorry for him. Old Navy. must go there to return some clothes that doesn't fit me, not because they're too small, but because I bought them one size too big. That's not like me I bought the clothes in San Francisco. I know and now I'm returning them here. I think it was definitely an impulse buy. I bought a shirt that had #24 on there. oh god, it's only been 6 minutes. this is way too long. this is going to give me what is it calle? carpal tunnel syndrome. thanks a lot prof! I'm just hungry don't mind me. I actually talk to myself that's great to know. matt told me he thought I talked to myself, but I only do it when n someone is in the room because I know that person is listening. my sister on the other hand, talks to herself. in the shower, while getting ready, while doing something. she doesn't realize it, I don't think. and now she is a professor at a community college in san antonio, where my parents live. I'm actually kind of scared of what I might write here today because now there is 8 minutes left. can't wait for this to be over over over. yesterday I felt horrible. it was just a bad day all together and I recently took that pretest thing that 301 requires. it made me think of all this stuff I don't want to think about. I wonder if I'm really crazy and the survey is going to tell me that. like they would send me an e-mail saying  thank you for participating, and you're crazy"""" """"go see a psychiatrist"""" yeah that's what they would do. well they wouldn't because everything is so damn professional now a days. you have to sign consent forms and give up your unborn child and all that stuff. I wonder if I'm being funny. prof, if you're reading this, you must have a lot of time on your hands. that guy that asked me if he could borrow my pen. he had some thing on his head. it looked like pantyhose tied at the back. what is that? what's that for? I don't even think that prevents you from getting hot or cold. it's one of those fashion things I obviously I don't understand. yeah things are too strict now. you can't do things you used to and people feel """"safer"""" but it's just a lot of fear building up that's going to explode one of these days. how sad is that? I hope I'm in another country when it all blows up. I don't even think people realize it because not everyone is thinking that way. they just live their lives and not care. like people who don't vote. I just think that kind of indifference is why the country is going to s#$@#$ yeah I'm not going to cuss here. I bet you're having a good time with this, professor pennebaker. ok now there is only 7 minutes left and counting. whoohoo! I can't wait to go home. I've done all this crap online today because my internet does not work at home on my computer. it works on my roommate's but not mind. that's just a bunch of crap. that reminds me, I should get a netzero customer service number while I have the internet available. I bet it's dark outside. what am I having for dinner? sometimes I just have popcorn for dinner. isn't that sad? I just don't have that much money to be spending here and there. oooh. but yesterday I did buy chik fil a for lunch. that might have been a bad move because I was feeling nauseated after that. it's not good when you have to sit through an hour and 15 minute class. yes that's yours, professor! I like your class though. it's so different from what I've taken here at UT and I've taken A LOT, believe me! I just think this whole pre=health thing that I am doing is just me trying to prove something to myself (first and foremost) and to others. I just want to know that I can do it. I think the profession I want to go into, optometry, is a good profession. I think I spend a lot of time slacking off. sometimes I'm really down on myself and I'm very hard on myself. I  wish I were not like that but what are you going to do? at least I'm not like I was last fall. I was such a mess. my survey will probably prove that. it was a very dark time in my life. yesterday part of that came back and that is why yesterday was not such a good day. I cried like I used to cry last year and it wasn't like me. I thought a lot of that aspect of healing was over, but I guess every once and awhile it comes back. I just have this feeling that she is not gone and she is going to somehow come back into my life. is this supposed to make me feel better? well gosh darnet it's working. I usually don't say things like """"gosh darnet"""" but today must be your lucky day, professor pennebaker. I like that last name. I bet you have a lot of fun with that. I'm curious to hear what music is played tomorrow before class starts. uh oh only one minute left. better make the rest of this good. mmmm. chicken tenders. that's what I wanted last night but was too lazy to drive and get it. I'm not that much a lazy person. I worked out on sunday morning and am still sore from it. that means I'm supposed to work out today. only 10 seconds left I hope you've learned a lot from me prof. because you won't set     ",1
"I already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of Peter Keating and a bit less of Howard Roark in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary. ",1
"3:34 twenty minutes to write what I am thinking Well, I am writing this at a time when I should be in class, but at least I am doing my homework. Between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, I think I have this class covered. I must admit I hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. When ever I get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, I can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. Don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. The guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. I know him, and has just said hello, The only reason I know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is Hot. Holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. This is really fucked up. I am trying to evesdrop as I write this. He is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. Why does she date hIM? He's so nasty. I'm hungry, I ate not to long ago, maybe I want a cigarette. Busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument NAZI. He was on the sick out we all hate him. Some dude I don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, It was funny, I am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. I am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. I am hungry, I wonder what happened in class today I'll just read the next chapter of the book, I like the book it is interesting. Lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell Friday, actually every day is good when I am not in class and don't have anything to do. The dude next to me started talking to me, I hate him, I don't even know what he said. Hey 3:54 see you bye ",0
"Well, here goes. I'm in my room right now and it's very warm. My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. Matt came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish Matt could stay here with me in Austin. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. Doug say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can I�m restricted to because of my boyfriend Matt. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at Doug because Doug wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. Doug doesn't like the thought of me and Matt spending time  together. He's weird like that. Matt should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. Matt is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. Matt doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 4th. Matt's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that I�ll be going to the renaissance festival  with Matt and Doug. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. Doug  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into Amanda. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If y�all read this y�all will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked Elyssa. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again Matt can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love UT. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  I�m partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. It�s resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. Matt left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to Matt. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with Matt in Florida. We went to Disney with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. ",0
"I lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her I started to miss her. I had attempted to email her but she never responded, I guessed that she was mad at me. I have emailed her 6 times with no reply but I am a persistent bastard so finally today, in fact just before I opened this page I decided to check my email as I do every day and there was her email. it explained that she had not checked her email all summer, it may not be true but it works for me. I proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around 10 minutes. I will eagerly await her reply as I basically demanded to see her. We'll see if she accepts. I never checked to see when I started this but I will keep on writing until I run out of shit to say. I assume that cursing is not a problem, I understand that this is a class full of naive little freshmen but I think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities, don't worry I wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and I am an avid cusser so I hope this will do (that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing). now I am running out of things to say. I like most of my classes. my major is biochemistry. I am 20 years old. I have brown hair blue eyes,  I like to play football watch football,  OPENING DAY IS SUNDAY!  I live for football actually,  I like movies, I am filling in space. this is odd and I am going to stop now. thank you kent ",0

"I begin by wondering exactly what purpose this assignment serves. I also wonder what will pass as the year goes on. Caffeine. I suddenly have a craving for caffeine. I would get up and grab a Dr. Pepper, but that would interrupt my writing process. What would it be like to be known as Dr. Steve?  Do I really intend to go through with getting my doctorate?  And if so, what happens afterwards?  It boggles the mind to think of the ways in which I may change over the next several years. Wow, I certainly am typing fast. On my old computer, there would have been a delay between the time I pushed the keys and when they appeared on the screen. I very much like this new flatscreen, it certainly goes well with my new system. Every computer I build has some odd quirk to it that no other system demonstrates. It may be my fondness for ATI video cards, or it could be my personality reflecting in the way that I put these things together. All in all, the system works well, but there are times when I just want to drop-kick it out the window. That, however would involve opening the blinds, which would expose me to the eye-squinting sunlight. I have always rather disliked the direct sunlight, partly because it is directly associated with heat. I can stand heat when it causes immediate, measurable pain, such as the burning of a hot pan handle. However, the discomfort of extended exposure to the hot, sticky, mind-numbing Texas sun can drive me insane!  There is a point after which I do not care, but sometimes it seems as if that point never comes. Time is certainly a subjective concept to the human brain. The saying Time flies when you're having fun"""" is absolutely true in this respect. If only it were the other way around: uncomfortable situations seem shorter, and the pleasant experiences extended. Alas, that is merely wishful thinking. My roommate's girlfriend just called three times within a 15-minute period. Ah, there he is. """"The ol' ball and chain just called"""", says I. What an interesting concept this telephone is. From pretty much anywhere in the world, you can have instant contact with anyone else that has a similar device. Of course, there is a slight delay due to the limits of the speed of light, but as long as you are on Earth, this is a relatively slight matter. Last week, I spent time with my family looking at Mars in my dad's telescope. Mars will not be closer for next to 250 years, and it hasn't been this close in nearly 60,000 years. From what I have read and heard, though, it has been within a few hundred miles of this distance in the last several years. Calling last week an especially special occasion is barely the truth. The difference is like standing in Manhattan, walking 10 steps towards New Jersey, and saying that it looks closer. One-hundred odd miles in over thirty-four million?  Absurd!  Looking at the timer, it appears to be about time to wrap it up. Wow, I just had to correct my spelling on the fly about ten times. I guess that it's not as easy to type correctly when there is another person in the room. ",1
"Ever since I came to Austin about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in Houston. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. ",1
"okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 10 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem281. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it"""". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 8. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        ",0
"Right now I'm feeling a little stressed out and worn thin. I'm a real estate agent and a full time student as well. I've been to Round Rock this morning again for the second day in a row for a 9:30 appointment. I just can't seem to get everything done that needs to be done. I've got a ton of laundry to wash, my cell phone is ringing AGAIN, and tons of reading and studying to still do this week. I'm a little down because I had two deals at work fall through yesterday. I had to deal with another agent that was the most ignorant and unprofessional one I've had to deal with yet. His clients backed out of a deal on my listing and as a result I'm not closing on my client's new home. It's not a good time to be a real estate agent in Austin right now, but I'm trying my best and I guess that's all I can do. I'm not a traditional student and I feel a little out of the crowd in my classes. I've been working full time since I graduated over six years ago and going to school at night. I finally got to a point where I couldn't take any more night classes and here I am trying to finish up during the day. I've learned a lot and I value my experiences over the years. Sometimes I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems crazy I'm doing all this at once sometime, but bills have to be paid, I have to eat, and the cycle goes on. I do work hard, but I've almost forgotten how to relax and take it easy. I don't have time to watch TV and do a lot of things I really enjoy. I guess I'm more frustrated at the fact that there aren't more hours in the day than I am at myself for not accomplishing more. This is an odd assignment to do. I've never heard of something like this before. I am enjoying my classes even if I do feel like the outsider in most of them. I like to learn new things and have challenges I know I can get through and do well with. There are some nice people I've met at school, but most people I've noticed don't talk a lot and don't make eye contact when you pass by them. I haven't figured out why this is yet, but I'm curious. I'm friendly and smile and talk to people. It's strange they don't always respond. I was just brought up differently I guess. I'm not feeling really great right now. It's probably from stress, but I'm hoping it's just something in the air that will go away soon. I can't afford to be sick. It just won't work right now. My nose is all stuffed up and my throught is itchy, so I've been popping vitamin C's like they're going out of style. Let's see. . what else am I feeling? Well, I'm in love and very happy with my relationship. I came here to Austin a year ago because of him. We have a good relationship and get along great most of the time. Moving in together and moving to a new city was a challenge though. I was the most pathetic, depressed little thing when I first came here but I've moved out of that phase and am much happier now. I don't deal well with extreme changes. I set schedules for myself, but I don't always stick to them because I try to fit too much in. I've been late to everything it seems lately and I need to work on that. I don't like being late because it's rude and embarrassing. I don't have a lot of friends, but the few I have are very good friends. My sister just moved here this summer and I feel like a part of me that was missing before is back again. We grew up a year apart and were like twins growing up. We can do that thing where you talk without saying a word a lot of times. It kind of freaks people out, but it's fun. My cell phone is ringing again. I'm thinking about all the work stuff that I need to get done today. I haven't had time to get to my office yet and I've got at least six people to call back here when I'm done. I'm going to have a lot of weight lifted from my shoulders as soon as my deal closes on the 24th. I need the money for sure. That's my other stress, but it's getting better. Overall, I think I worry about things too much. I've always had enough to get by through good times and bad. Somehow I always make it through. I guess I'm stronger than I look. I'll be back to work in a minute. Maybe I can learn to balance my schedule better over the next few weeks. It'll be easier someday I'm sure. This has been interesting. I feel like I've been rambling for 20 minutes. Well, I'm back to work again.          ",1
"Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment. At least its easy, right? Oh well. I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am I going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. I really like this new piebald cd. its happy. I hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. I think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. I need to read more. especially for school. I just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. I'm tired, I should go to sleep. but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no ",0
"Start. the question is how can I make a good grade in this class? most people are smarter than me so I have to try harder to make a better grade. I know nothing, that is all I know. I don't know what to say when I see a stranger so I do not speak. frustrated. confused. tired. lucky. healthy. homesick. lonely. but its all good ill be alright tomorrow right? fuck you big country you bitch. there are so many new people here its overwhelming. I am mute. I want to make friends but I do nothing. stupid. harmless. harmful. nice. relaxed. worked out. bored. nothing really to say to mom and dad just what I did today. can't talk about some of the other things because there is no need for them to be burdened by my troubles. but they would like to hear it anyways. maybe I will try talking to them. am I crazy? I hope so. its so much more fun to be crazy. like in catch22, which I just finished reading. its really interesting to mess with people the way yosarrian did. I miss paris. I love it and hate it but love it more than hate. everyone is connected to everything else. especially in paris. I don't know anything right? because I am from paris? I'm so sick and tired of people from Houston, Dallas, Austin, san Antonio trying to make me feel inferior and they know everything so much better than I do. but I come from a small town and know I know nothing. who is smarter now? I love the country. there is nothing like it. big city people are pop people. they are so one way and not another. all the cheerleaders dress like brittney, all the guys dress like Backstreet boys or some rapper from the east coast they wish they could be like. in the country its all different. anything goes believe it or not. everyone listens to everything. everyone can dress however the hell they want to on any day and no one think differently. that's another thing that confuses me. I'm from the country and I listen to all kinds of music. everyone I meet is pretty much into one thing and thinks the other stuff is lesser quality until I put some stuff on and they say oh I like that now. but they know more than me. jester is like Westgate. drugs are everywhere and easily obtained. you just got to know who to ask. I'm glad I ain't into that. I stick with some beer myself. its funny how beer is harder to get than drugs here and everywhere I've been. the government has their focus on the wrong areas. I don't know much about government because it was so boring to me in high school. I may not even vote in this election because I don't see a real point in it. someone else has narrowed down my options so evidently they got that far they can do the rest. I miss brother sid. it hurt me when I found out he had passed on but I didn't cry. I really liked listening to him speak in church. he had a real way with words and was very emotional. our new preacher is a lot different as was to be accepted but its still not the same. he tries to make things to complicated and show his intelligence when everyone knows you are suppose to preach on a 3rd grade level. but why is that? that's like saying hey you wont get very far in your spiritual education if you never get higher that the third grade. third grade was when I broke my ankle outside running and some black girls started laughing at me. I stayed in school the rest of the day and was tough you know, trying to act tough. I didn't cry the next year either when I really messed it up jumping on a trampoline. I cried when I couldn't play baseball though. that was when I was good at baseball. before I wanted to quit so bad and cried while I was playing. of course I had a lot of shit going on in my life then. adolescence can be a bitch. but I was lucky enough to make it through it and once I got out of my depression I haven't really been in one since. I get sad a lot and have notorious mood swings but nothing major. rosanne is a huge influence in my life. i've never heard anyone else say that. she's has a totally different approach to life. laugh at yourself in the mirror every morning. make fun of yourself before others do so they know it doesn't really bother you and they wont make fun of you for whatever. water. drink. wet. still thirsty after every drink. don't know why that is. can't get the taste of chips out of my mouth right now. taste always makes me hungry. but i've already ate so there is no need to now that I am full and don't need to eat. I wonder what lindsey is doing right now? I think I have figured her out. she likes to tell people what she thinks will sound good and never lives up to anything she tells me. but she's my friend still. my friends in paris have all moved away. I wonder what andrew is doing in Arkansas right now. he just moved the other day I think cause of crazy ass aliece. she gets weirder and weirder everyday. like stevens roommate russell. that boy is strange. he thinks he is Mr. badass and knows everything. I wonder if he knows he's a spaz. he said my car system sounded like shit. he's listened to good systems and mine is shit. first time anyone has ever told me that before. maybe its true but still I don't even know they guy that well and he's only heard one time but he knows. I'm stupid. my arms hurt. they need to be stretched. I wonder how long i've written for. my roommate likes to play videogames and turn the sound up loud. have some respect man. I don't do stuff like that to him. I'm glad everyone isn't like me. then id feel different. have you ever thought of life as a cartoon or wished you could do stuff in cartoons? it makes it much more interesting. it also makes me more creative I think. or crazier. but I like doing it anyways. I haven't had a square in 4 days now. haven't had a beer since i've been here. maybe I will but I don't really miss it. they were wrong when they said I couldn't have fun without beer. what were they thinking? what was I thinking. I wish I would meet a girl that meshed with me. but if only get my treated badly again. oh well I'm not going to change cause I know one day it'll get me the girl i've been looking for. FINISH ",0
"My mind is pretty tired right now, but I can't get it off of having a good dark cup of coffee. I have gotten all of my work for this week done already so I'm at ease about that. Whenever I type I have to look at the keyboard so it kind of pisses me off. Now I'll let my mind wonder, I sometimes think of home and all of my trashed out friends there. Have you ever wished you could help a person you care about a lot, and they just won't listen to you? Well my friends back home have been doing drugs heavily for a while and I cannot do anything about it. In a time where controversy and sex sell the theme, it's hard to decide which is the winning team. There are just some things in life we can't understand, like why in the hell we can fight over land. I think we all need a helping hand, so we can rise together and make a stand. At a time perfectly linked to your transition can you even tell me your position? No because 90% of us don't even listen and make the right choice for our provisions. I see a new generation with many faces. Bringing together people from many different places. I think discrimination is in our past, but I do not know how long that thought will last. It is a society we ourselves cast, and sometimes it seems like a supernatural blast. To think of all our generations drugs, hell I myself have been associated with thugs. But still we have a consensual love, and I don't even think it comes from above. My thoughts and feelings always rhyme so prepare yourself because it's my time. Fuck all of the bullshit and fabrication, for we are the ones who'll shape this great nation. So I do have a proclamation What do we do without an education and occupation? In a time when money and power mean everything, how in the hell do the bells of freedom ring? Sometimes I wonder about our future in store, and if we'll still neglect the poor. We have so many people locked in cells, it's almost as if we're under a spell. Cast by our so called forefathers, and I seem to be the only one it bothers. For evolution will always take its toll, look back at how we burned the totem pole. Who will burn us and how will we know? Until we're allowed to run our own show. Everyone is so quick to judge, and even quicker to hold a grudge. Just because we all have different views, doesn't mean we cannot find a use. So even though this shit won't sell, when will we wake up and demolish this hell? Our constitution is all of our rights, but it is changed everyday in the supreme court lights. Who are they to decide the meaning? I think we all see to which side it's leaning. Leaning towards more control over us, I think about it sometimes so much I want to bust. So when I say this I will not blush, Why are we in such a big fucking rush? ",1
"what am I ganna do ? psychology, freshman seminar, all I can do is smoke a cigarette. gosh, am I really ganna get cancer? I hear that every cigarette you smoke takes 5 minutes off your life. my hair is getting long. I wish I could have long hair like Rapunzel. the blonde lady on the wallpaper of my old house. in the guest bathroom. she sat on an elephant. surrounded by trees and shrubbery. god how I used to want to be that lady. I remember as a little girl standing in that bathroom, staring at the wall and at myself in the mirror. where does time go? am I ganna be able to pull off this college business? a computer that is so stubborn. I have no clue how to use computers! I wish I was in all writing classes. I have so much homework. how am I ganna get into the school of communications? do I want to be an english major? gees! 10 hours at the sorority house a week! I wonder if I'll be able to concentrate there. the sound of the paper on my cigarette burning as I inhale. that sketches me out. I need to quit. I need to study. so, there was the door. I got a ticket to the game. what game? I have no clue! football? basketball? I have no clue! I need to get my act together. damn, I'm out of cigerettes. the food downstairs makes me nautious.

"     I'm cold right now. I should get a blanket. I miss my boyfriend. I wonder if he's at work right now. It's 11:28 there. Someone's being loud in the hall. Maybe it's those weird girls that Melissa and I had to   look at   last night. They wouldn't stop chittering!  And it was almost 3 o'clock in the morning!  I had to wake up this morning at 7, but I didn't get up until 7:33. I hate waking up early. My eyes are all sleepy, and I couldn't keep them open in Spanish!  I love my Spanish class. Prof. Montiel is quite interesting. Oooh!  The 2nd season of Friends is coming out soon. I should get that. But I like Prof. Montiel. I like his accent. This morning he told us that we (8:00 class) are going to adopt a poor hispanic family in December for Christmas. What a good idea. I need to go and find a service organization to join. I think a sorority would be fun, too, but I don't feel like paying for my friends. My friend Heather took out a loan for her sorority at A&M. Silly girl. But it's typical of her. Yesterday was my birthday. I don't like being at school for birthdays, I've decided. You don't get as much attention here as at home. I felt kind of lost, in fact. My roomie brought me flowers, though. And mom sent 50 million presents. But it's not the same as being there. I don't want to go home, though. I like being away from home. I just miss my cat, though. I like having something warm and furry to come interrupt my homework. He's so cute!  I also miss my dad. Poor dad. Mom's going to drive him crazy. Dad told me that he's going to start kayaking more often. Mom needs to get out more. All she does is sit at home, read, and worry about me. Definitely a disadvantage to be an only child. But I did have a pretty good child hood. I had enough friends. Too many, sometimes. I really like that Lucien character on Amelie. He reminds me of Joey. Only, Joey's not mentally ill. I would hate to have to wake up as early as Joey does every day. Four-thirty in the morning is insane!  Silly Marines. what do they possibly get done that early in the morning?  Don't they realize that the majority of their troops are ages 18-25?  I've heard that people in that age group, and then teenagers as well, are prone to stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning. Makes sense to me. I would do it every day if I could. I like staying up late (when I have the energy). For some reason I feel like I can get more done at night. Like cleaning/organizing my room, for example. Why would I want to do that at night when I'm just as capable of doing it in the morning?  That doesn't make any sense. I need to change the song on the stereo. I'm not in a very UB40 place. Righteous Brothers are good. But this song reminds me of Joey again. I hope that the Marine Corp. Birthday Ball goes well in November. I'm really nervous. What should I wear?  Good grief, I never thought that I'd type that kind of question. How flaky. But I am still wondering what to wear. Would a gown work?  And what color?  This isn't like a school dance or anything. This is a real thing, where Marines and their wives/girlfriends are there. Older people, I mean. I always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. I feel like they're all wondering,   what is she doing with him?   or   she's way too young to be here.   My hands are beginnning to ache. I keep backspacing my mistakes. Perfectionist. That's me. I wonder if I really am one. Maybe not. I wonder where Melissa is. I should look at her schedule. if I can find it, I mean. My feet are cold. How do I keep that from happening?  And why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's?  Is it some sort of evolutionary thing?  Or just another one of those differences?  I miss my friends. Maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. But I miss Brandon and Lauren. And Mary. I couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. My mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. Whatever. She could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. I don't get it. Sometimes I feel like she's the best friend ever. But then other times (*most times) I feel like I'm being left behind again. Why do I get left out?  I think I'd like me if I were someone else. Even when I'm with Brandon, or Lauren, when we're in a group, I'm not the popular one. I really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.  ",0
"Well, here  I am writing continuously for twenty minutes. The weird thing is that this keyboard is laid out differently than the one I have back home so it makes typing really difficult. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I got a cut on my finger and hitting the I button tends to hurt a little bit. I am a little concerned about coming to the end of this line but apparently it will automatically wrap my words for me. I am going on a trip to the beach tomorrow. Well at least that's the plan. We don't have anywhere to stay not to mention any food. Oh well, it hopefully will be a lot of fun. I am sitting at Mac 9. I wish they had IBM's in here. That would make my life a little easier. The computer in my room crashed and I can do absolutely nothing on it right now. It's weird I have been writing for about five minutes and I am only on my third line. Well I guess that's what long lines will do to you. There were really long lines at the student computer center the other day. MY roommate was such an angel and stood in line for me when I went to class. A girl just walked in to the computer room with headphones on. I think that is a little weird. I guess she likes to listen to music and type at the same time. I guess you can do laser copies in here. I will have to remember that. I went out for coffee last night with my roommate and his girlfriend. It was a lot of fun and I got checked out by someone really cute. I wonder if this computer lady will help me figure out my e-mail in a little bit. Last time I asked she dismissed me very quickly. That shirt reminds me of McDonald's. The one a guy walked in here wearing. I really wonder what you are going to learn from me by reading this. Probably that I am very random, (all my friends tell me that) They also tell me I am a crack head. I'm not really, it's just an expression they use for me because I am so random and jump from subject to subject. Don't you think it's weird that we still write stop on stop signs. We could probably save a TON of paint if we didn't and besides who doesn't know that a red octagon means stop. That sounds like a really bad commercial. I have to go to class at 1:00. I feel weird telling people that I am going to Acting class. I feel very pretentious. I really think I am going to like the class though. I have been in theatre since fourth grade I just completely lost my train of thought. It got derailed you could say. I wonder what derailed it? Oh well, I guess that's what you are trying to figure out from me writing this. Life imitates art. I miss Ronnie Geva. Not really, but she is someone whom I am supposed to miss. I really miss Amanda. She is one of my best friends in the world. I called her the other night and when I heard her voice I could do nothing but cry. The computer lady walked by. Apparently she chooses whom she likes to help and who she doesn't. I never know when to use who and whom. I think I am going to save this really quick so that I won't accidentally lose it. Wait never mind that would lose my train of thought. I think it would at least. I really wish I could read some of the other students stream of consciousness papers. I want to see how similar they are to me. Maybe they aren't similar at all and I am the weirdo in the group. That's what my sister would like to have me believe. She pretends that she doesn't miss me but I know she does. I wonder how this whole e-mail thing is going to work. I can't wait to e-mail my dad and Amanda. I would e-mail my mom too but I don't know her school e-mail name. It's scary how many e-mail accounts my family has, I think the grand total is eight. Maybe nine. I don't know if my sister has one at school or not. It depends which class she is in. Nine accounts and four people. There are way to many ways to reach us. This is an odd power PC. This computer contains the fonts necessary for the software packages Plato and Socrates. I  wonder what those are. Probably some English programs or something. At least that's what the name implies. El tiburon means shark in Spanish. I think there is an accent but I am not so sure. Fireworks are really cool. My mom and I love to go sit under them and feel the booms. A couple of years ago there was a grass fire near where we were sitting. It was kind of exciting. Not something like rescue 911 but still it was interesting for us. I hope you find this interesting and not just some drivel about me. Drivel is such a fun word. It reminds me of dribble. Well, I have to jet. I hope I didn't write for too long but It is fun getting your thoughts out on paper. Like I am doing now, Auggghhhh the insanity. Or sanity, however you want to see it I guess. ",1
"of course I don't ever really cry--or at least not very often. I've been waiting for a really big cry since I moved here a month ago--but no tears. I left some of my best friends--though I have over a dozen friends here from my home town of College Station--but not all of them and I left my house and my birth city and my parents and two of my dogs(the third one I brought with me). though I don't really know why I am writing this to the computer as if it will respond back or much less cares at all about my personal life. I suppose that i am just suppose to ramble and write what is in my head--yes I am so tired that I am repeating the directions for this assignment out loud to myself and I am actually so bored and tired as to write them down as part of my assignment. I suppose that that bit alright. it is now 1:28 am and that means that technically I cannot write again until after mid night tomorrow or today or whatever which is too bad because that would make my life easier to be able to do it tomorrow afternoon because I only have one class but I suppose I should stop bitching at the computer. because frankly it is a computer--of course now I am worried that this should have been some philosophical expression of how I, erin, tick as a human being--but now I am way to tired to rewrite this--if it won't send properly then I promise myself to do something deeper next time--for now, however, I'm done.

"it might be a good idea to join a coed frat for engineers because then maybe I will get some studying done and actually get help on my calculus from someone who knows more than I do. a bagel sounds good right now since I haven't eaten lunch yet, but not will jelly, I think I will have philly cheese instead. this place is a mess, if my roommates leave anymore of their curlers and hairdryers on the floor when I get home, I think I will have a cow. that's okay, they are great roommates, they always do the dishes and for the more part are considerate of my belongings. here on out I am going to eat healthier and exercise a bite more than I have been lately. I hope by me playing more racquetball lately will not effect my previous tennis skills. rob will die if I do get better because he hates to loss. that would be so funny if I could kick his butt in racquetball, but then he would be pretty upset. although I think I can relate to his family more than I can to him. his head is in the clouds will all of that philosophy he reads. I can't understand why someone would pick a worthless major like philosophy when all you can do is write a book or teach. why not do something with your life which you can apply and gain new knowledge from. besides I think everyone should have to take philosophy, because there are basic ideas everyone should just know, but not to major in. my roommates are home, I have to close my door. they are so loud, I think I suppose to cook tonight, looks like I need to go to the grocery. I think chicken, pasta, and some kind of bread, oh yeah, and a salad of some sort will be good tonight. I need to make sure they eat something later so lessen the affects alcohol will have on their bodies. I am so sick of drunk people anyways. all of those girls that came by last night, were all drunk by the end of that crappy box wine. anyways, it is gorgeous outside, I hope to find time to swim in the pool I haven't yet been in, I feel like I live in a resort living here, we have everything. I have a great life. I live two of the most wonderful people, I have a family who completely supports me and a boyfriend and school and everything. the little things in life for the most part I enjoy and I having freedom, enough to make any grateful person happy. and even if I don't have all these things, there is plenty to be grateful for. too many good things, great food, great wine and genuine love. although these enjoyments wouldn't be the same with the not so enjoyable things. I love life, no destination, just a journey and one that you can turn in any direction you want. life is what you want it to be. but I don't want to get caught up in idealistic idea, but should keep my feet on the. my roommate came in, no thank you. what was I thinking, oh yes. keep my feet on the ground by also being realistic, and many think that being realistic is the same idea as being pessimistic, I differ. maybe those are the people who are actually ",1
"     I was so excited about coming to UT and I still am but alot of things just over whelm me. For example, people in Austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools. Basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes. What it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. I nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. That really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. I know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. One thing that i don't like about living in Austin is that it is so expensive to live here. Every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. I really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. One more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. But i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. I wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. That is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. And now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. For example, in Dallas she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to TCU i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. My goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. I can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams. ",1
Ok so I am writing about my thinking. Well tonight was interesting. I had a great time at the Phi Lamb meeting. Laura was really sweet I hope that I will get to know her better. I wonder who my big sister will be in Phi Lamb. Hmm interesting. I love big sisters in organizations. Which is kind of crazy because I just talked to my big sister from the drill team I was a part of in high school. Random. Even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me. I promise when I have kids they will never be more than like three years apart. I can't believe that in ten years I will probably be married with kids and all that. Oh my gosh. Where has the time gone? I am actually excited about being a mom. My mom was amazing. She may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her. No one can argue like her that's for sure. I miss her. But I will see her this weekend. I can't believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game. It is crazy. I can't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home. Which is totally crazy. I never thought I would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast. But I guess that is a good thing. I will be here for four years so I should probably make it feel like home. So now that my boyfriend calls I am thinking about him. I can't believe I am doing this whole long distance relationship thing. It is the hardest thing in the world. I miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late October. I wonder if we will make it. I know we can but it is so crazy. Four years of being six hours apart. I wonder what we would be like married. It would be amazing to be his wife. He is the most amazing guy I have ever known. Everything I could ask for he has. But still I get scared sometimes. I wish I could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him. I guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away. I also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which wouldn't be good for either of us. I believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if I had him there with me all the time. Anyways wow it is already eleven. I really like this song. I had never really listened to Jack Johnson but it is very relaxing. I wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now I like this one too. It kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why I like it so much. I wish we had a TV though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger. Which is great but I don't know whatever. Tomorrow is Thursday. I don't really like Thursdays. My classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok I guess. I had a lot of homework for tomorrow. College is a lot different than high school in workload. Like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy. I guess its good that I am typically an overachiever. Well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me. But whatever. I hope tomorrow goes by fast. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go out on a boat. That is going to be so much fun and then Saturday is the football game. I can't wait for that. I have never been to a UT game so it is definitely going to be an experience. Wow it has been twenty minutes. I guess I am done. Ok bye. ,1
"I feel really good today because it is my birthday. I'm looking forward to being with my friends later on today. I'm thinking about tonight because my fraternity is having a match with the ZETAs. I'm pretty excited about it because they are the hottest girls I've seen so far. I kind of would like to go home though and see some of my friends back home. A lot of them are making trips back home this weekend to see some concert. I also would like to see my family on my birthday but I am sure I will see them soon. I don't really know what else I should write about except my birthday because it's all I have been thinking about this week. I plan to go pre party after I finish this writing assignment. So far I am loving it here in Austin and am really glad I chose to come school up here. The size of my classes is quite a surprise and something I just have to get used to. I really enjoy having all the freedom here compared to back home in Houston. I wish I had more time to just hang out but I stay really busy lately. Being a pledge in a fraternity really can be time consuming but it is worth it. I've met so many people these last three weeks and I'm sure it will be the same for the rest of the semester. Now I'm beginning to draw blank and can't think of much to write. Oh well, it's not like anyone will actually read this passage. I've got five minutes left on my time. I am so glad to be out of high school. College is much better though there is a lot of work to be done. My date better look good tonight in her eighties outfit for the party. The theme is an eighties prom but I just went got some clothes that look like their from the eighties. I can't wait to see what other people are going to be wearing. Well time is up. ",0
"All I want to do is sit on my couch and take a nap while sitting in front of the TV. I'm trying really hard to not procrastinate as much as last semester. I usually wait until the last minute to accomplish anything. This was assigned about two weeks ago and I'm just know doing it. I've had plenty of time to do it, but I find myself wanting to plop in front of the TV instead. I love being a couch potato. My mind wonders a lot and people tell me that I'm a daydreamer. Whoever reads this will probably agree that I can't keep my train of thought on one idea for more than two minutes. This weekend I have to go home and see my grandmother who is in ICU because she was in a car wreck. I really hate going to hospitals and seeing how sick everyone there is. It scares me to think of what might happen to me in the future. My mom told me that she probably won't even remember me. I can't decide whether or not to hang out with my friends when I go home this weekend. I know that I will and will not accomplish a lick of homework or reading, but I will still give it a whack and take my books home. I don't know why I even bother lugging them around when I know that they will sit in the corner of my room. My brother and I are not speaking and it's been about two weeks so I kind of miss him. I'm supposed to be in his wedding in November so we better start talking by then. I can't decide what I want to do tonight. I might try staying in for once but that is very unlikely. Even though there isn't really anything terribly exciting going on during the week I still manage to find anything to do but be at home. There actually isn't anything good on TV at 12:30 PM, but I sit in front of the TV anyway. Usually I keep asking myself why I'm watching this stupid show and wonder who in the hell actually thought that shows like """"Sister Sister"""" and """"the Smart Guy"""" were even remotely funny. Why do those shows even stay on?  I don't know a single person that watches or thinks that they are funny. ",0
"I have finally made it to college. I miss my family and friends but at the same time I am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. It's is something new. I feel confident that I will succeed here at UT, but most importantly, I want to succeed. I am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. I sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. However, each day I feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. Above all I find myself missing someone back home who I have only known a short time the most. He is a wonderful person with whom I have this extraordinary mental connection. Being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. It makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. I am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. Well I guess I will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation. ",1
"I'll try my best not to organize my thought though and just write what comes to my mind. This stream of consciousness reminds me of my senior author oh what was her name she wrote To the Lighthouse and Mrs. Dalloway. Her name will come to me in just a second. She was a very depressed person I still can't believe she committed suicide by drowning herself she must have really wanted to die. Oh well, I can't remember her name write now. It is strange that I can't remember her name considering I read over a 1000 pages of her writings and wrote three papers on her work. I think I can't remember because I feel too much stress the remember it. In fact, I feel like right when I stop thinking about it her name will pop into my head. I can still vividly see what the covers of all her books look like in my head. Ok I am going to stop thinking about her for right now and think about what I read earlier today from C. S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. It is amazing how much I am learning about the Christian faith and I have been a Christian for a while now. I like what Lewis says about society and morality. How what a person does my himself is important for society because laws do not make moral men. No matter how many laws one can write up the immoral man will always find new ways to get around the laws so what a man does by himself is important to society which had important implications what how society should run and about many privacy issues like abortion. Well I think that privacy is an important thing and it really bothers me how we use of social security number for everything and how the government wants to assign us all a medical id. I will vehemently oppose such a measure. It is hard to write all the thoughts that are in my mind because my mind works a whole lot faster than I can write. So while I'm in the middle of writing this sentence I have already thought of 2 other things. I am kind of disenchanted by politicians and politics. To get to such high positions of power, one has to compromise which means one must be corrupt but I wonder if that is really true I wonder if there can be honest politicians I wonder if there can be honest lawyers. I surely hope so  You know I remember reading one that Diana always had a feeling that she was going to be someone important one day. I wonder if everybody had that same feeling and if it is just a fantasy or a dream that everyone has I still can't believe she is dead you know I feel like I am kind of censoring what I write because of the possibility that so TA might what to read some of these stream of consciousness writings to get a couple of kicks out of it. I think I probably would if I were a TA  it must be really difficult to be a TA and be a grad student. it is hard enough just being an undergrad student. my head kind of hurts right now I wonder if that is from stress  I think it is. My apartment is quiet right now I am very glad I didn't go out with my roommates I like being by myself every once and a while. I love not having to worry about any body but myself but I also love being around people. I really do like having a roommate because you can talk and have fun together I guess everything has its ups and downs Even though today was the first day of class my first day is not really till tomorrow because most of my classes are on Tuesday and Thursday instead of on MWF  I'm really now to nervous right now but I am sure I will get stressed out this semester I really need to learn how to deal with my stress. if not make it go away at least manipulate it to my benefit. Ok I only have to write for a couple more minutes. It is interesting all the strange connections that one thinks about  it seems like I think about the same basic 15 things over and over when ever I have quite time to myself I wonder why that is I am excited about this psychology class. learning about human behavior is always interesting to me  I think some people like psychology so much because they want to learn how to manipulate people and control them -- I guess sort of a power issue  I hope that now why I am interested in psychology. Well, my time is up now It has been kind of staged my writing but only slightly so I still have in the back of my mind this the knowledge that some one might read what I am writing Oh well ",1
"Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 45 minutes. But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy Michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put """"so anyways"""" instead of """"so anyway"""" I think that sounds as dumb as """"laters"""" when one really means """"later"""". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how Cindy is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. Within reason that is. so anyway. I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted. I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. I am so proud of myself lately. I am being such a good girl. Although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at Trudy's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway. I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. I'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. I have been developing such good habits. I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early. O shit. I just got a little flash of procrastination. That sneaky devil. NO GO AWAY!!!. I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. I just don't have the time for that. I run every day . Mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. Damn that dinner. UGH. What else do I do. O yea. I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too. I haven't been drinking. I haven't been too flakey. With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. Anyway we are good terms at the present. I'm being a pretty good daughter. I finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. I want to write about something cool. No luck. I really want to join the p2 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes. Bad flutes in lol. I'm probably really bad by now. I wonder if there is practice rooms around. I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. And then I would act all shy and innocent. It's just how I act. Natural reflex to wanted attention. Sometimes I think I'm so stupid. And then they would flatter me and ask me out. And I would act like I wasn't really sure. I little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you. ",0
"I really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at Kinsolving, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. Pennebaker seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. I guess I will go for a little while, not too long because I have a class at 930 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. Why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? I don't freaking get it. It's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. WHY? Are the powers that be trying to torture me? Well, whatever happens, I will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. I just thought about something, I am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to Oklahoma for Labor Day to visit my auntie Bev, and my Uncle Lawrence. I wonder how Precious is doing. I hope she still isn't messing with that idiot Kevin, like I think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. I mean, I know that I have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but I learned my lesson. I want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when I need it. Is that too much to ask for? Gee, I can go on and on about men, and the experience s that I have had with them, but that is old and I am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that I can be on the dean's list like I want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and I hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that I do this year and my years to come. I know that I am capable of doing it all, but I just want to survive. This city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!  ",0

"okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 8-9:30 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :9:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute ",0

"The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 3 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in Austin. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at UT it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from Incarnate Word University in San Antonio. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. ",0
"tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. I've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as I've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.

"I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that Austin is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in Austin, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. ",1
"This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio, Texas. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in Colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life. ",1
I�m sitting at the computer. I just got done working out. my arms and chest are sore. The pain is good though. I want to go out. I want to start playing golf again but it is too expensive golf is fun but I like to go out partying but its expensive my girlfriend is bothering me oh well I like it my friend is talking about a boat it makes it harder to write but it is ok because I�m using his computer I want to play lacrosse but it is very rough I don�t understand how they play but don�t hurt themselves badly ya know well anyway I feel like running oh not really it is weird how my mind says stupid things that make no sense I think I will go to the steamboat and watch those two girls play again this will be their last time to ever play like it is a monumental breakup or something but hey what if one of them becomes good maybe I will be able to say yo man I saw them play live. noway  bro yea. cool They are pretty good I cant believe e I ever liked country music because it is all so fake I mean nobody writes there songs they don�t do anything but sing and look pretty especially the women. if you are ugly it is nearly impossible to be a country singer. unless you are Leann Rimes then you can tell every one that you are 14 and that�s ok because instead of the rednecks saying damn she�s got a nice ass I guess they could say she�s only 14 and that makes them happy. but if you think that ugly women is 14 you are sadly mistaken she�s back ok well I sure miss my Jim Roam I liked that show but it is on the air in Austin oh well Austin is cool anyway even if there is no damn parking. I miss the old days of just driving around town and then thinking to myself  I go there and hey what do you know there is a parking spot or even a whole lot of parking spots. yea but then I would have to live in my boring ass town where there is nothing to do at all I mean take tonight for example I�m going to watch a band play in pearland I would be sleeping but here I�m going to start drinking a couple minutes in fact I will start drinking now oh no there is a man possessed by alcohol on the computer you must stop him he could easily kill some innocent family of 4 walking along and that would be very very unfortunate. ok whatever I�m crazy no not really so I am just about done here according to the little clock in the bottom of the screen in the bottom of the screen cool I�m going to party I quit bye  ,0
"Pretty much, I have enjoyed my time here at UT. I am taking all my classes, and I am doing reasonably well in them. My calculus class does not seem to be too bad except for the fact that the professor pretty much gives us the book word for word in the form of notes except with indeeds and such that is thrown in there. My Sociology class is pretty good, the professor is a nice lady and is very enjoyable to listen to. We discuss all sorts of interesting topics and the favorite one of hers is that there are more than one genders. My Chemistry lab is a 5 hour class and it is ok so far, but we have only done a basic lab to measure the density of coke versus diet coke. I still have to write up the lab report but that would not be too difficult to do. My Chemical Engineering class is very laid back to the point where it is disturbing. We have 1 class meeting a week for a 1 hour period with many of the classes not being taught by the professor, but by other members of the Chemical Engineering department. There is no final and we end the class in November. To me that just seems a little disturbing. My psychology class is not too bad except for the fact that it is in a huge auditorium that for the most part is very dimly lit. The atmosphere in it is not very helpful to students who are tired after all there classes because it does seem to make falling asleep a whole lot easier. The material covered in the lectures is all very familiar to me as I did take Psychology AP in high school and I have kept all of my notes from the class. Unfortunately I only managed to make a 3 on the AP exam so I did not get credit. One thing I am contemplating right now is whether it is wise for me to be taking two social science classes when my degree plan only requires me to take one. I have taken Psychology before and I found it to be very interesting, but right now Sociology is coming out to be much more entertaining and the homework assignments are to watch two good movies (One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Empire of the Sun) and to write a short paper on them regarding the sociological ideas in the movies. Currently I just got off work from the Blockbuster on Guadalupe street where I had a nice night except for the fact that my brother called me on his cell from Houston saying he had run away from home. That was pretty weird when I found out he had run away and what was the cause of it. I did find out that it was all about an assignment that his lacrosse coach had given him and the assignment was an extremely religious one (my brother is an atheist). The coach said that the players were free to give him a book to read on a conflicting point of view, and my brother chose to give him a book entitled Atheism, the case against God"""". My parents were extremely mad at him and called him an intolerant asshole. My brother overreacted and called them assholes and said that he did not need parents anymore since they weren't really helping him out. My brother's views on God are basically that there is no God and he doesn't really care what others think about his views on religion. He also doesn't try to convince them of the fact that there is no god, he is merely doing as his coach suggested, providing a book with a conflicting view (my brother hasn't even read the book). I pretty much told John to take a walk and go get a soda so he could cool off for the evening and then head home if my dad hadn't found him yet. One thing about my family is that we are all very stubborn and don't back down from the views we care about. It leads to a lot of fights. After I finish this writing assignment, I have plans to play this really addictive computer game called Civilization III. In the game, you build an empire from 4000BC and research all sorts of technology, manage cities, wage war, and survive. In the current game I have going, I am playing as Hannibal of the Carthaginians, and my enemies are Alexander of Greece, Caesar of Rome, and Cleopatra of Egypt. Currently I am at war with everyone and in the process of wiping out Greece. My armies have been battling Greece for the past 5 hours of game play time which in years of the game is from the period of 1776 approximately to 1991. It is only since 1980 that I have managed to conquer many cities. Egypt and Rome were at peace with me until I launched two tactical nukes at the Greek cities. The declared war on me and I am not sure why. I did make an official declaration of war against Greece and then they attacked me. So now I am building modern armors (good tanks) by the hundreds, working with a communist form of government and I am going to eliminate greece before I wipe the rest of the world out. The only reason I am doing so well is that I have better technology than the rest of them and superior numbers. The can just move faster in their own territory, but I will conquer. I even have a nuke prepared to fire on Rome when I start to take them on. Farewell, I am off to conquer the world. ",0
 Right now I am sitting at the computer feeling very good that I am finally doing this assignment. It had been on my mind ever since it was assigned. I can't wait till I am done. Because I know I will feel a sense of accomplishment . Ever since the lecture on Tuesday every time I think I can picture that video we saw in class where the part of the brain was warming up or so called cooking. I imagine my brain is cooking right now trying to think of what to write next. Earlier today I found my emotions changing alot today and I tried to figure out why they changed so much at one point I was extremely shy and the next minute I was outgoing. Right now I feel very comfortable with myself and extremely confident. My thoughts are going every which of way right now. Because I feel pressure to do well in school from myself and my parents. I really would like to please them and show them I am responsible and smart. I feel as though it is not me right now. I find it truly fascinating that my mind is coming up with some of these things right now. I find it really intriguing. Now even after going to class I really feel like hearing the lectures really has made me realize alot of stuff I had not noticed before especially trying to feel what I really feel not what I just think I feel. It just occurred to me that I have not looked up once to see how much time has gone by. I could write this for a while just tracking my different thoughts and feelings and emotions. When I mentioned something earlier about my parents and how I wanted to impress them. I pictured my parents and started having feelings of love because I know they are there for me if I need them. I never have stopped and traced my thoughts before until now. I am wondering now if the tests are going to be hard in this class. I feel pretty hungry right now so I can imagine my stomach relaying something to my part of my brain telling me it is time to eat. I wish I could get controller the part of my mind that controls addiction because I sure would like to quit smoking. I feel as if I have no control over it anymore. When I smell cigarettes smoke. I feel my mind say wouldn't it be nice to have one of those. I guess quitting smoking is telling that part in your mind no and to be stronger than that. That was weird how my mind suddenly brought up smoking I guess because I know I have to quit because it is so bad for you. Well that�s time I really enjoyed this assignment.                      ,1
"     Well, today is September 11, 2002 and that of course means that my day was filled will deep thoughts and feelings and constant reminders of the tragedy that happened a year ago today. I remember exactly where i was the day the Twin Towers collapsed. I had just woken up and was on my way to class when i bumped into my boyfriend at the time who was on his way up to his dorm room. He stopped me and said   did you hear what happened?   Puzzled i scratched my head and shrugged i had been asleep up until like 15 min ago and now i was in such a hurry to get to my class that i had been oblivious of my surroundings. I now looked around the lobby to see that every t. v. had a cluster of people around it with their mouths hanging open. There was a whisper and constant murmur in the air that i hadn't noticed before.   What happened?   i asked. He started blurting about this and that about World Trade Centers being bombed or something to that effect. I sighed and said   really, that's terrible  , then i scurried off to class. Little did i know that what i had dismissed as simply government/political jumble would have such a severe impact on America and myself. When i walked into my class i was met with the same constant murmur, it seemed to be everywhere. I sat down in my seat(front row) and looked up to see that CNN was being shown on a huge screen at the front of the classroom.  My mouth dropped in horror and terror filled me as i watched with my very own eyes, one of the planes slam into a huge tower. It was then that i realized how serious this thing was. Then the second plane, and after that the third. America was being attacked. That phrase played inside my head fueling the growing terror inside me. America was attacked and would never be the same again. It was then that i realized something else. My mom was out of town. She had left on a business trip for the week to. was it Virginia, West Virigina? It was an annual trip and i remember her saying it was 20 minutes away from D. C. Wasn't that where the Pentagon was? I remember thinking i needed to call my dad as soon as possible to find out where my mom was. After class i ran to my dorm and found i had a message i pushed it and was more than relieved to hear my mom's familiar, and now beautiful voice telling me not to worry that she was okay but might be late coming back home cause of flight delays. Even now i have tears in my eyes thinking about how lucky i am to still have both of my parents and my family. I couldn't even imagine losing them especially in such a tragic way. Then this makes my feel so sad for the people who weren't as lucky. I pray for them and even though i have been extremely busy and overwhelmed i made it a point to go home to visit my family because you never know what could happen. My family is not a very expressive one and we hardly ever show our emotions for each other show, but yesterday i left my mom with a genuine   i love you   and a hug. ",1

I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others. now someone else is sitting next to me. hmm. its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority. but that can't be right. it must just seem that way. there are so many people and I don't know any of them. someones chair keeps squeaking. oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes. what is that ringing. I don't think cell phones are allowed in here. I need to write a letter to danny. I wonder if hanna plays this weekend. I know they do. but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon. I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them. I don't know which one is better or worse. oh well. that chair squeaked again. I don't see any printers. hmm. I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny. its almost eight. I need to read. I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going. well that answers my question. ",1
"I just messed up. it has been a while since I�ve typed. It probably won't turn out to good. I wonder what time it is. I am kind of worried about my friend from Sealy. I just got off the phone with her and she has lost twenty pounds. She looks really good but she wants to lose twenty more and I think that is a little to much . This assignment is so easy and I keep messing up. This keyboard feels funny. the backspace key seems further away than usual. I just stopped typing because I can't figure out why when you get to the end of a line it won't continue to the next line it just keeps going. My roommate is standing behind me reading what I am writing . I don't care if I misspelled something because they aren�t checking on spelling. I am so glad Chase called tonight. It makes me feel so much better to know that he cares a little. If he didn't call though I was going to call him and figure out whets up between us. I can't believe it is ten o'clock. I have been studying since about six. I talked on the phone though with my friend for about 30 minutes. I wonder why the words skipped down to the next page. I hope I didn't mess this up. I cant wait to get y hair cut tomorrow. I hope it turns out good. I cant wait to see Chase. I hope I am doing this right because there is only two lines of words appearing on the page. I wonder who my roommate is calling. Maybe it is that girl he met this weekend. about 15 minutes has already gone by. I am going to go on a diet tomorrow. I wonder why he keeps pushing all the numbers on the phone ,I keep hearing that beeping noise. I don't have that much time left and then I am going to take a bath. I can't seem to capitalize my I's. I wonder what the next writing assignment is about. I think I am going to do it tomorrow night so that I can get it out of the way. I wish I could type really fast. I wonder how fast Mary can type. I need to do some more reading tonight before I go to bed and I really need to see my math TA before class tomorrow so that I can get some help with my math. I wonder why the e didn't stay at the end of the word it skipped down to the next line. my typing has gotten better though since I started this assignment. I wonder who just came in the door. I have about one more minute to write. I wonder what my roommate is studying. I don�t know what else to write. I wonder if they are ever going to read this. If someone happens to read this HI!  I bet its pretty boring reading all of these. My time is up Bye! ",1
"I have done these things before and I really don't think that they work. I had to do one in English one time and I hated it. I guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now I will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. I love scream, its on the tv right now and I like this movie. ;  I here that the second one is do out this winter so I�m excited. I really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. The brain is so complex. I used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew I was thinking about itself. Hmmm, I don't know what to say  exactly. I am gonna play some pool after I get done writing this paper. I have a pool table at home so I am probably better than average but lately I've been playing worse and worse. It really frustrates me too. I hate when I don't play basketball for a while because then I go back and I'm just A LITTLE OUT OF RYTHEM OR I MISS A SIMPLE SHOT OR SOMETHING. Recently I have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and I feel bad about that because I always pre3ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. I'm being A BIT Distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. I don't know I f  I can really   fill up another ten minutes but I guess I can because I have to. It really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because I've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so I don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines I don't know if I agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because I know I don't think of sex that much. Imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny A hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. I often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. I wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . I coughed. ehehehehe  I think I have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. I wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get I would love to be able to read some of them . I think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. I don't know what I�ve been told . I like led zep but not all of their stuff. It is pretty good though . I wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . I hope so Oh my time is up so I'm gonna go know. Bye bye baby!!!! ",0
"I keep thinking about the future and how my life will alter during and after college. I wonder how my grades will be after the first term. I hope I can make my parents proud. I don't want my parents to view me as a failure and a screw up I want them to be proud. I want to be accepted by everyone I meet. I want to succed in life. I wonder how my math test will be tomorrow. I just wish that society didn't view people on how much money they make I wish I could go to a place where everyone was the same and there was nothing to worry about maybe the place I'm thinking about is eternal utopia or heaven. I wonder if there is a heaven what happens after death where do we go. do we ever see the """"creator"""" what is the creator is it god or did we evolve through evolution of mico o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",0
"I just had lunch, they actually had good cookies at the dobie cafeteria today. i'm really happy i found out that masha lives in dobie too, she kind of bothered me in high school, but i think i might like her now better than almost anyone i met. she's very sincere. i've been more happy than ever since i've been at ut only because i'm on my own. i feel no sense of homesickness at all, like most people are talking about, i'm the way i like myself without my mother who drives me crazy. i don't understand sometimes how in the world we're related. someone just came in. i love that feeling when you feel like your stuffed animals have personalities, the two dogs on my bed could easily be taken for real ones, well kind of, if one of them wasn't blue, maybe. but not really. alex and arif came by last night, two of my good friends from high school, it made me really happy; i was literally bouncing off the walls because i thought it was nice that they just came by unannounced; i don't know why it surprises me because i know they care about me, but when people i care about do something nice; it kind of surprises me. i could never keep a diary, i absolutely love writing more than anything in the world. i want to become a writer, but i always start with something and never finish or am honestly too lazy and that pisses me off a whole lot. i love it and i want to do it, but i don't know why i won't just do it. but diaries drove me crazy; i found myself being fake in them, i think it's easier to show your true self through other words rather than blatently posting,   i'm writing this about myself to understand myself   it doesn't work like that for me. you can see the real me through other writing i think . i downloaded this song called   forever   by ben harper. it is so good; it has the sweetest melody. it's very wierd; i sometimes write poems and just little phrases and i've noticed i use the color blue a lot. like the ocean is blue and once a poem about my parent's divorce and i used something about a blue world or something; i don't know where it comes from. my mother really drives me insane. her friends were in this past saturday and they came back amazed at my independence, how i looked, acted, just my persona and everything and they weren't like that  before about me. and i know that i do seem a little different; like a relief has been lifted off of me ; it's great. i like the person that i am. i spent too much time babying my mother, making sure i didn't say something to offend her or be upset because she was being ridiculous. and she told me how they though all of this and said it in such a way as to take credit for my development and for me being the way i am, sounding great and all. and i just wanted to scream that it is the opposite; it's only because she's not around. she can't seem to figure anything out for herself like that; she thinks she understands so much, but she doesn't at all and i think deep inside she knows she doesn't get it, but it just makes her feel better about herself to think that she understands it all, whatever it may be, just that she's in control, otherwise she wouldn't not let me stay out after ten some nights when all i did was go to a mmovie with my friends; she just does it to be in control and i wish she would see that she's only pushing me away and she already has; i don't think we will ever have a great relationship, not if she tries to understand me and herself. i just wish she could at least understand herself first. i don't want to be like her when i get older and that's partly why i don't want to agree with her on anything because by doing what she thinks she became the person she is and i don't want to be that person. that's sad and i don't like it, but it's just the way i think it is. i really want to go dancing. a song is playing that's called   just dance   and i want to do just that.

"I have an aching headache and coughing every five minutes. I can diagnose that I have a cold because of my symptoms. The symptoms plagued me for more than 3 days and will not go away. This is very upsetting because I am planning to go tubing with some friends on sunday. If this sickness is ongoing, I may not go tubing. I'm taking a lot of medicines to relieve myself from this sickness, but nothing is working. My frustration is aiding the sickness to persist. There's one class I'm having problems in. The class is microeconomics; I failed both quizes and so behind in my reading. I'll spend a lot more time studying for that class than any others. I always have something to do but my sickness is preventing me to fulfil it to my best potential. I met a lot of people and made new friends in college; it made me have a sense of belonging that of which I lacked in high school. After me sickness is gone away, I know that I will have a great time and have a sense of directrion in life. My floor is so friendly and nice. We go out together and a maater of fact we went to Olive Garden last Sunday. I joined many societys like the Pre-MEd adn Pre-Dent societies to better my future and put me ahead of others.  ",0
"Well hello there, I just decided to start my writing assignment. I'm bored since my roommate, Travis, for class so I decided to do this assignment today. I hope it isn't boring. It seems like an easy assignment, and since I'm not the best writer I'm grateful. I'm not the best typist either. It's a lot different typing something to hand in compared to typing to your friends online. My nose hurts and I'm tired. My throat tastes bad too. Hmmm what else. This is kind of a weird assignment. I have too many thoughts to write them all down, and I can't type fast enough. I'm struggling here as it is. For every thought I write down, a couple more are being wasted because of my bad typing skills. I keep having to go back and fix all of my typos. I have to call my friend today. I'll do it after I'm done with this. I saw a funny download about some coffee bean that was like the matrix. I liked it a lot, but I can't find the site where he got it, so I guess I have to call him. Also I didn't call him back last night either. I'm using the idea where you type it in notepad first then you paste it to the web, but I'm not sure if it's coming out the right way. I don't want to do this again, so I hope it works. I have to go turn down the air cause it's freezing in here, I can barely feel my fingers. There, it feels better already. I wonder what George is doing now too. He went out with me last night. I don't have anymore classes today, and I want to do something cool. I do have to do laundry. I'm not sure if that is how you spell it though. The bag is getting big and smelly. I have to clean before my old girlfriend visits. She is very nice and beautiful. I'm mad because we broke up. Long distance relationships don't work, but we still liked each other a lot. So far I haven't seen any girls here that I want to go out with. I'm not sure if it's because I really like Laura still or because my standards are a lot higher now. This is kind of fun just telling you everything, I'm doing my best now not to remember something really embarrassing that I would have to type to you. I think this is what a diary or journal would be like if I decided to keep one. I always wanted to do that, but I don't have the time. In second grade our class had to do one and draw pictures of our day too. I liked doing it and I tried to keep doing it but it just wasn't the same. I just lost the motivation to do it. It's always fun to read my old second grade one though. I was such a dork back then though. Not that I'm Mr. Popular now though. It sucks here because at high school I knew everyone and had lots of friends. Now I still have some of my friends but it will take sometime before I know what's happening on the weekends. I still really want to meet a girl here, but I just haven't seen any that I really like. I just don't want to go up to random girls and ask for their number either. Personally I think I'm selling our if I do that. I'm not sure why but I feel stupid, like I'm trying to be somebody that I'm not. I just glanced at the clock and I have about a minute left so I'm going to stop now. I'm pretty impressed with my work here. I hope you like it, if you read it. ",0
"     Well I am sitting in my apartment thinking how weird it is to live by myself with out a roomate. I stair at my fish, and don't know many of my neighbors since I am new to the Austin area. My room is a mess, I am a total slob and hate to admit that. However, I would clean it up if I had a guest or to. But not during the week me and my friends are busy doing homework and trying to inteact with orginizations around the UT campus. I still miss my dance at Blinn. I worked so hard for that team and myself finally made friends in that little town. I am happy to be at a new school though for a new fresh start. Tryouts for the UT dance team are on thursday and I am debating back and forth if I will make it and how bad I really want it. I know for a fact I really want that spot on the dance team it would be a complete honor. But then again I have this attitude that if I don't care the dissapointment will not hurt as bad if I don't get the spot. I am just so use to being on a dance team and belonging to a group. Everyone knows me as the dancer. so what am I now if I don't make the dance team?  I actually miss home its been about a month and a half since I have seen my parents and I miss my 2 cats soo bad!  I miss my ex boyfriend terribly and wish I could see although he is 3 and 1/2 hrs away at Sam Houston University. I miss those hugs he would give everyday even when we were friends they honestly made me feel good inside. I am acutally quite bothered that my boyfriend won't call me back. I haven't seen him in 3 days and just wanted to see him for a little while. Everytime I ask him if I can see him and have to ask still after 5 months of going out he always answers with a I don't know. I feel like I need a lot of attention and hurts my feelings when he seriously does that. Not allowed to hang out with my best guy friend because these two don't get along however I don't agree with that and hang out with him anyways. I don't feel as I have to clear everything with him. I am happy that I have my two best friends here though quite close on campus. One my bestfriend from highschool didn't see much of eachother there for a while because I went away to school for 2 years and she stayed home. Alice and me have been roomates for 2 years in a tiny dorm room and decided that we wanted to live by ourselves for a change. I actually enjoy it and can do as I please. I am aslo worried about finding study buddys for my classes because I am sure my grades will be better if I study with others. Its hard to just start talking to people. when I am new I can be a bit shy. But once you get to know me I am a quite talkative person full of energy but people don't know that unless they approach me. I need to dye my hair red again becuase my mousy brown hair is starting to show again and I hate it. . glad I don't have to go to work today becaue i have soo much to do this week. I should really clean up my apartment because I have a major ant problem going on here especially in the kitchen. Its one of my best friends birthday's today I called her up and shes going out tonight wish I was here but I'm not in Houston. Wish I could be home. My dad just lost his job but has been wanting to leave for awhile. And does have a back up he has his own business called    Inland Homes  . Now I am glad he can dedicate all he can to his dreams which is having a successful business of his own. I am worried about him though he has been very stressed out latley. I need to call T. C to get help with my homework. . I will pass that darn T. A. S. P test soon! I don't have any other choice I am eager to get out of math and graduate college.  ",1
"I have a paper to start writing for English, and I'm dreading it because it will be very hard. It's about the short story """"A Room of One's Own"""" by Virginia Woolf. In that story she also wrote in sream of conciousness so that is kind of weird. I really do not like the book at all. It's incredibly boring. It takes a feminist standpoint of women writers, and since I am not a feminist and only took that class because it was all that was open (I wonder why),I cannot relate to the anger Woolf seemed to have about there not being many women writers. Now, I am trying to figure out exactly what else to write about in this paper. It is really hard for me. I did the other assignment first because I found it much easier to do then this one. I don't completely understand exactly what I am supposed to be writing about, but we did stream of consciousness in my AP English class last year, and I think that it's all about writing exactly what the thoughts are that come into your head as they come into your head. My geography class is awful. the teacher is so boring. I've almost fallen asleep every time I go into that classroom. I decided to sit closer today to try and pay closer attention to what he's saying. I wonder if it's just a myth that the closer you sit the more you pay attention. Maybe that could be a psychologiacal survey we do- if one has not already been done on that. Now, I have again drawn a blank in what to say. it's so much easier to think when you don't have the pressure of having to write it down. I think my fried Alison is mad at me. She goes to A&M, and I had to write her an email about A&M's unfortunate loss to FSU yesterday. It's not like she hasn't made fun of UT. I feel like I'm back in Jr. high!  Alison and I have been friends forever- actually only since 9th grade but it sure feels like forever. I miss my friends at home. I feel like we've gotten so distant from each other and it's only been a week since I left. I talked to my friend Ann last night, and she was distant to me also. We just didn't have much to say, our lives are completely different from each others now. It's so weird how much people change from each other when you change their surroundings. I guess we were so much alike because we were constantly together. that could have a big effect on things, huh?  I wonder how long my friendships with people will last. The only one that seems to be maintaining right now is with someone that I wasn't even very close to this year- it's so odd to me how that happens. This twenty minutes sure is taking a long time to end!  I have to go put some money in the bank today. Actually I have a ton of errands to run today, but I need to finish my homework first. I still have a lot of pages to read in """"A Room of One's Own"""" even though it was supposed to be read by today. Oops!  Then I have that awful paper to write over it. I mean who really cares about Mary Carmichael, Mary Beton, and Mary Seton? I don't even know how to start writing it, I don't even completely know what I'm supposed to write about. Well, it's been twenty minutes and my thoughts are becoming jumbled so I'm going to stop writing now. ",0
"I am bored, I don't know what to write. I think that I am going to enjoy college. I miss my friends and family from back home, but I am starting to mak new friends here. I will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. If I do go, I want to make sure that I will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that I went I didn't really get mush time to sleep, so I was pretty tired on my way back. I have been tired all week long now. I went to bed after midnight last night and then I had to get up this morning at five so that I could go do the PT test for the airforc ROTC. We didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. I wish that we could have worked out too. I really hate it while I am doing it, but afterwards I feel pretty good. Tuesday, when I got done with my PT test, I started throwing up on the field. I was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when I had to start the two mile run. My time for the run went up a minute. I will try to get that back down. I want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. I want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. But I care more about those than the run. I need to make up an excercise schedule for the ROTC. I don't really know when I want to do everything. I will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. Since I have to wake up at five on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. I will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, I will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. That should be plenty of excercise. I will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. I wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but I barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. I think that I will like it in the Air Force. It doesn't look like I had thought that it would be. They were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on TV. It looks a little more respectable that the Army. I hope that I will like it. On Tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. I want to find out what they had to do to get them. Someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 GPA. I'll bet that there is more to it than that. But I want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. If I have to get a loan, it will look better. It will also make me more elligible for scholorships. I am going to need the money. NExt year,   I think that I will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. I think that I would like that more than living in a dorm. It is too noisy here. My roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and I always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. I know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when I am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, I just want to scream. But next year I will have my own place by myself. That will be nice. The only problem will be that I will have to cook for myself. I don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. That probably won't be very nourishing. I will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. Maybe Melinda and I could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while I go to school. She could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. But I don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. I would really like to help her out, but I don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that I helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. It was very irritating, also. Still, she is a very good friend that I know will always care for me. She is very nice. I just don't think that she is very good handling money. But not everyone is good at that. She is very good with kids, and I'm not very good with them at all myself. I never know what to say to them. I start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, I run out of stuff to say. My cousin Dillian liked me pretty much though. My mother was telling me about how he was so excited that I always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. But I was pretty bored when I was watching him. I couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. It wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour. ",1
"I feel kind of nervous right now. I have never done anything like this before. at least not as something to turn in for a class. lately, I've been thinking about school and how this semester is going to. I need to start looking for a job sometime this week. one of my best friends is coming back from Sacremento, CA this weekend, so I'm really excited about that. I haven't bought all of my books yet, so I'm hoping to do that soon, especially for this class because we have a test pretty soon. I took this class last semester but I totally slacked off and got a D in it, but I need to take it again in order to get into child psychology. I don't want to let my parents down again. my sister took this semester off because she got bad grades last semester. I know that I can do really well this semester if I really want to and I think that I do. I just really hope that everything works out ok. I guess you've probably noticed by now that I ramble on and on. I think that stream of consciousness is really cool. I think it was Virginia Woolf who made it popular. I think it was her. I  loved the way she would start talking about one thing and then that thing would remind her of something else and then she'd go off on that. I don't know how much I'm supposed to be writing . I think this assignment is neat. I hope that I'm going to be able to handle working and goingt to school. I worked at late night at jester last semester, and I think it was the hours that threw me off because I would work from 8pm to 1am. I live at kinsolving this year and I think that it's a lot better than Jester. I think I've been writing quite a bit already and I think that this is my stream of consciousness. all that I really do think about is doing well this semester because I want to be an elementary teacher already. so I guess I just hope.

So twenty minutes?  I'll probably finish at 12:40 and then oh that guy is     wearing a blue god its hot she has really black hair and this room is really hot it's     funny how I keep repeating the same thing over again I don't know what to right     Lakamini was in chemistry class today I feel bloated and stupid for writing that on     my assignment Monday I am going to have to go to cardio and weight training and     I don't want too my hands are getting sweaty and I'm not sure if that's how you     spell sweaty but this gum is really getting hard and I feel bad for chewing so much     gum gosh I can't believe it took me like four times to spell out gum I wonder how     many minutes I have left I don't want to look up at the time because then  the time     will go by slower so I really need to practice more on my typing I make to many     mistakes and then  it makes me frustrated see I wonder what my mom and eric     and dad and chito are doing I think my mom is going to make chito some pasta     which Eric really likes and I forgot to capitalize is that how you spell capitalize well      I forgot to capitalize the other names I'll just do it when I am finished if I can     because I don't know if the computer is just going to shut off should I keep     pressing the cap lock key when I don't even need it maybe I'll go by Wendy's and     get a salad but this gum reminds me of Mexico It's only been seven minutes and     why did I capitalize the I in its should I put a comma the person reading this is     going to think I am stupid why did I do that why did I need to stop making so many     mistakes my legs are so sore and the my vision is starting to blur kind of  probably     because I was in the sun then I came inside why am I putting periods at the end of     a word it's  not like it I'm tired after this I will email meghan oh who cares if I don't     capitalize her name yeah only nine more minutes to go good because my arms or     whatever they are called are starting to stick to the I can see my nose my arms are     so sore from all those push ups these chairs are really comfortable that guy looks     like some guy from san antonio I wish I had clear skin again without holes but I     keep going to the stupid doctor and they all tell me the same thing and I am so     tired I just wish somebody I keep uncapitalizing the I how do I put little commas     around the I oh well I only have five more minutes but so many girls here have I     should sit up  this computer is really nice I could put it in my room I don't think I am     going to wow our brains do do a lot of thinking that's probably why my head hurt     sometimes from all the thinking or probably I am wrong three more minutes that     ola organization was good but  I felt like I was in the youth group because all they     did was talk spanish daniel is going to get mad at me because I didn't call him     after class we'll probably go watch cabin fever it is supposed to come out today I     wonder if it will be good  my finger s are all jumping around the wrist is hurting     from all the one more minute to type I don't  god I can't type I haven't typed what     did I just do my toe itches but should I keep typing for more I guess it would look     good or maybe not because whoever is going to read these I am sure doesn't     want them to be that long that way I wonder how much longer I have been typing     for probably only one minute  but I am going to stop now because I have to go to     class in about fifteen minutes. ,0
"     The first thing that comes to mind is that when I do these things I don't know what to write. I just sit trying to think of things to write. This to me is like one of those awkward situations like when you are with someone you don't know and have to make small talk. This is like tring to think of something to say to that person the only thing is, is that your the only person here trying to think of something to say to the computer. Another thought popped into my head and that is that I don't know what to do in my speech class. I have to give an interview to someone and be interviewed by someone and I have no idea on what I want to do with that. I had an idea and the professor was going down the list of names asking us what we were going to do ours on and I had an idea and the girl before me took my idea so now I am left here with no thoughts on what to do in this situation. I will just have to go on and think of something else to do on this project, athough I am not to really worried about it. I wonder if while doing this writing experiment that the reader ever takes into consideration that some people might have periods where they just don't think about basicly anything. That they are just in a daze where no clear thought comes into their mind and they have absolutely nothing to talk about. I was just wandering. Now a song that I hate has just come on that I heard for the first time while I was visiting for the first time that part the family that you don't talk about because they are imberasing. I don't think I spelled that word right, but anyway it was in Arkansas and I don't plan on ever going back there again. Now another song I hate has come on but I am in a delimma because of this contineous writing thing I can move my fingers to change the station. I now looked up at the clock seeing that I only have three minutes left and this is not as hard as I thought it was going to be, but my essay has been pretty boring because I am tired and had nothing to talk about. The reason I am so tired is because I have an eighto o' clock clase everyday and it really, really sucks. Well, I only have 2 seconds left and actually I would like to talk for a longer period of time but I guess I will talk to myself on paper where you can read at a later time, bye. ",1
"     I'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. I was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best I can do with how ready I am now. It's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, I've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. Habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. You'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. So much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. Only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. That which makes things most apparent is contrast. I could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if I drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then I'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which I don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. Escher's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 2 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from GEB, EGB, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. Even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. With any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. The anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. But what is to name something?  Very far from actually understanding it. So we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. Murphy and Godel, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of Murphy's law was true. I hope that makes sense to someone besides me. How can anyone ever trust words?  They give us so little to go on. Try describing an experience you had to someone else. They'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. Divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. The impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. I am the universe and I act in the universe. I can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. Let's try some meditation. You hide, they seek. Sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. Instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. This is as true now as it will be now. Hahaha. oops. I don't know what it means. My ass hurts. I should shift or something. That's better. I think I forgot what I was supposed to be thinking about. Don't take points off, please, haha. I still don't know what it means. Any of it. I've done this type of thing before but the time I remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. The goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. Phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one I was handwriting and somehow, I still can't explain it, I just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd ",1
"I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 40 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 5 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. ",1
"I'm not sure since I've just started College and haven't had any tests yet. I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 15 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. ",0
"at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in Austin or if I should return to NYC and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 4. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like Reid or Jason or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. Danielle is the only person who I can count on and maybe even Nicole if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       1. get a 4. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the Boston area in case I feel the need to leave.    2. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 6 pack by years end if it kills me      3. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      4. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) ",0
"Today has been a pretty good day, I guess. It's Thurs. , so it's closer to the weekend, which always makes life feel better, for one reason or another. I've had a lot of homework, and I know that the fun is only just beginning. I hope that somehow I will be able to keep a healthy balance between social life and school life. So far, I honestly think I've been spending more time studying and reading for class than doing anything else. My dorm floor seems kind of rowdy at times. I just wonder how all these people can just go out and hang around and do all this stuff all the time. Don't they have homework, too? I wish that I was just really really really smart so that I wouldn't have to work so hard to understand things, especially things that seem relatively simple to many other people. I went to the SI group for Psychology today, and I really liked it, although we didn't cover much class material, considering it was our first SI meeting. However, I like the small atmosphere, and I like Anna. I think that if I have any questions, it will be easy to have them answered then. I'm starting to worry about not making new friends and stuff. I guess it will all work out in time and I'm just feeling insecure for no reason. I would like to have someone to go to the game with Sat. (today is Thurs. , Sept. 7), but my closest friend here has to work, and I haven't met anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to go together. Oh well, that will all work out, too, I suppose. I kind of like this writing thing, because it's like writing in a journal, and I think it's healthy to write about feelings and such. Sometimes I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing with my life in general. I'm undeclared in school, and I have no real idea of what I should do with my life in the future. Certainly one day I will recognize that I have a specific purpose to serve. I would like to figure that out, soon, though. Tonight I'm going to Starbucks with my roommate. We grew up together. I really like mocha and caramel frappacinos. It's really interesting to me how popular coffee drinks are now. We had a discussion about this in my sociology class. It's such a trend right now. I'm starting to get tired of writing, now. I have that irritable feeling where it's just almost miserable to sit here and do this. Well, it's really not that bad, actually, I just want to get this over with. check it off my list of things to do. My family misses me! They're very proud that I'm here, though. I hope that I can continue to make them proud. I guess that all depends on the tests. I don't even know what to expect. I just pray that I won't do that terribly bad. I'm definitely going to do my best. Okay, six more minutes. Do you know how long six minutes is when you're sleeping and about to get up? I cherish those last few minutes in bed, really I do. My mom called me this morning about forty minutes before my alarm went off. That was annoying, but luckily, I had no problem falling asleep again. I can't believe some people that have worked at the University get paid only $20,000 a year in some cases. That's incredible. I'm not sure a strike is appropriate, because students are paying money to be taught, but still I was shocked to hear that from Prof Pennebaker. Girls keep screaming down the hall and I feel like I'm nine years old at summer camp. That's weird. I've been thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. I'm thinking that it would be easier to study if I lived off campus, but easier to get involved by living on. Maybe next year I'll try getting an apartment and see how that goes. Well, my time is almost up. Bye. ",1
"My chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. I find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. I have come to the realization that Indian producer people truly are strange. This realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. I mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. The people upstairs just made another random noise. It sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. I'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since I don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. I really don't know what they do upstairs. The people next door to us are just as strange. They screen their phone calls I think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. But then I hear them in their room. Actually, I'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. We've gotten some random phone calls. Some of these calls came from people I know very well and yet I can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. I just realized that I have very random thoughts; I think that this means that I'm not really focused on what I'm doing or something. Actually, I'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. I just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. That is quite sad; generally I always have something that I can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. Yet when I'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. I wonder when I'm going to get rid of my cough. I refuse to take cough syrup because I don't like the taste of it, and so I'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. I don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. Then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. That would most definitely not be a good thing. I guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. At least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. Grape is a good flavor. Chocolate is a good flavor too. I like chocolate. Actually I like all sugar; I think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar I intake daily is what causes my oddness. But sugar is good nevertheless. So is chocolate. I don't think it causes acne. How can something that tastes so good be so bad? Of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, Italian food, etc). Ah well. I never knew twenty minutes could last so long. It's neverending. I feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. There was just another random thud from the people next door. I think they must have dropped something plastic. I just realized that I don't really know any of the people who live around me. I think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. That's kind of sad, considering I hear from everyone that """"People who live on the same floor as you become your family"""" and I don't really seem to sense that. We all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. That, to be honest, is the one thing I didn't like about UT. The fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. Even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. We all have our high school buddies. Well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. If I had counted the number of times I hit the backspace button during this exercise, I think I would come up with this huge number. I never knew I'm so bad at typing; I have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet. ",1
"I just had a conversation with Sarah. She can be so touchy sometimes. It seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she can't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying. Just a few minutes before hand, I was telling her about what I need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness"""" writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect, she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that wasn't pre-planned. I told her that that was not """"stream-of consciousness"""" because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story. Then she just got irritated and told me that I don't do that to her. And I was like, """"What?"""". She doesn't make any sense. Oh dear. Surat is screaming her head off and I have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight. It is 10:30 and she usually starts screaming about now. Surat is a nice bird though, other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood. She usually keeps herself pretty entertained. There she goes again. I should tell monica to cover her. Moni is probably busy with her studies. How am I supposed to tend to my bird while I am doing this assignment? I have to stay here and complete it or then I wouldn't really be doing the assignment right. That brings up another point. What is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 20 minutes. Are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment? Would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break? Ok, I had to go cover the cage but it didn't take more than five seconds(literally) because the cage is on the other side of the room that I am in. That is a relief. Now she isn't screaming. Now what should I write about. Hmmm. I had a yoga class today. Ashtanga Yoga. It was very difficult to do and very fun. I hope to become really flexible this semester. I also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester. I got a texercise pass from Gregory gym for 55 dollars and I have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes. It is wonderful. I just wish I didn't have this psychology class at 3:30 to 5pm because two really good classes go on at that time. It is really disappointing. I can't believe I am taking a psychology class(301) this late into my undergrad. I am a senior and I am just taking this class because I decided just recently I want to go into Counseling Psychology. And in order to do that I need 4 Psychology classes with a """"B"""" or higher. I am going to make an A in this class. This summer had a large effect on me. I realized that I really didn't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family. I think I just spelled that """"adequate"""" word incorrectly. I hope this assignment isn't going to be graded on spelling. That would be ridiculous because this is a """"stream of consciousness"""" paper. What if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly. This page doesn't have a spell checker. People are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing. Have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing? My sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers. That seems so ancient now and that was only about 11 or 12 years ago. Its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years. What is going to happen next? I will tell what will happen next. We will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left. The earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise. I think they should study that in psychology. Why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings? We are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources. We are causing a great imbalance in nature. Would they even be able to study that in psychology? That might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they don't want to admit how ridiculous humans are. or rather, can be. I really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology. Or at least I have more experience in those other two areas. I tend to take the middle ground however. I am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and I am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment. I think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist. Am I going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology? I hope not. Psychology is a good field, don't get me wrong, but one has to remember that everything has its faults. I took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments. Some of the questions were funny to me. I think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica. Haha. My 20 minutes are over. Guess you don't get to read about my opinions on erotica. ",1
"My main thoughts right now consist of music. I am thinking of a new song that I wrote about my thoughts on the people that I have seen at UT. Music I feel is the greatest thing in the world because I get to release all my emotions through a song. I think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. These reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. Surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. I don't believe any of them write their own songs, so I can't see why people would think they are talented. This brings me to something else I do not like about people, they are generally fake. What I mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. For example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. This things I do not do and hopefully never will. I feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. I thought by coming to UT that I would see less of this type of attitude from people but I now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. From this point I would like to say that UT is great(except for parking)and that I do like more people here then I did in high school. I am not sure what I want to do with the education I am receiving from this school but I hope that very soon I will recognize my calling in life. ",0
"     As of now I wonder what will become of me at the University of Texas. These first few weeks have opened up many new experiences to me. Being able to make decisions by myself and not have to worry what my parents think is weird to me. My dad was the principal at the same high school as me which limited me to what I could and couldn't do due to the fact that he had a reputation to uphold in the community. Back in my home town people would associate me with my dad and hold me to different standards than everyone else at the school, but in college I don't have to worry about my fathers reputation and I can be the person that I really want to be. This is strange because my whole life I have had to worry what other people think of me, but these last few weeks my whole life style has changed. It is strange living away from my home town because many of my friends are there and I have lived there all of my life. I am sure I am going through the same things many other freshman are going through right now. Having to meet new friends and find my place in Austin is harder than I thought, but at the same time I like Austin a lot more than I like my hometown. My roommate is cool and it seems like we will get along fine over the year. I was worried that I would get a bad roommate because I have heard so many horror stories about bad roommates, but I guess it turns out that I was lucky. I can't wait for the next UT football game. I missed the first one against North Texas but I have my ticket for the one against Houston. Many of the people that I already know up here are going to be tailgating and have invited me to go with them to the game. Hopefully during this time I will get to see some of my ex-neighbors that I grew up with. The television is starting to get on my nervous because some dumb movie is playing and this monkey keeps making stupid noises. I find it hard to try and write for 20 minutes straight. To follow my thoughts is hard because it seems I try to hide them even from myself. I think this might be due to the fact I could never say what I thought when I was growing up. I always had to follow the   norm   and if I didn't my parents would scold me and tell me not to think that way. Since my parents both come from a more traditional up-bringing I don't have as many experiences as other kids have had.    ",0
Why am I doing this assignment?  I do not want to be here? I think I want to go to sleep. I wish Greg would shut up so I could do my homework. When I play basketball I wish Dustin would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish Dean would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in Houston. Dwan needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish Greg would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. Greg needs to shut up. Greg is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. Greg better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily Greg left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket. I need to find that guys number but I lost it so I guess I will never find it. I hate HOT I think they are gay . So I do not know why Dustin is listening to it. I wish I could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. Why doesn�t he listen to some other music that sounds better. I wish I could go back home and drive my car. I miss driving my car. I got a Honda Civic. It is silver and it is all mine. I am thinking about bringing it up next semester. I wish they would turn this music off but then again why do I care. I wish they would play some Tupac or Snoop. I have two more minutes. I wish the two minute would go by faster. I need to get some carpet for my room . I'm thinking about switching my major. I might go to business or I might just stick Psychology and try to go into physical therapy after I finish college. I have one more minute left and then I am done. Toad is stupid. I hate Puff Daddy this song is sop overplayed. ,1
"Well, I'm listening to 3 Doors Down. My friend told me about this song, and it's pretty good. It's about people being in love. I'm about to change the song to So Far Away by Staind. They're my favorite band. My roommate isn't here right now. I just got finished eating with my brother. He is 31 and the best big brother. When he dropped me off at Jester that was the first time that I have cried since I've been here. I didn't even cry when my mom left. I guess our relationship is stronger even though I don't get to see him that much. I think my roommate and I are going to Lake LBJ this weekend. I have a house on the lake. We'll probably invite a few friends to join us. I guess get away from the dorm life and act like it's summer again. Man, I have a lot to do. I need to return two books, mail a couple of letters, and some other stuff. I should be writing this down. Oh well. Hmmm. I'm running out of things to talk about. Oh yeah, the smell. It smells kinda funny in here because we had chicken wings the other day, and we still haven't cleaned out the dishes. Oh yeah, I have to do laundry too. Dang, that's going to be a pain. I have tons of laundry to do. I'll probably wait until this weekend because then I can use my own washer and dryer. I won't have to wait for anyone else. Now I have to go to the bathroom. I wonder if that counts off if I stop for a second. Well, I'm going to try and hold it in. I wish we had a bathroom in here. Then it wouldn't be that big of a hassle to go to the bathroom real quick. Hmmm. my roommate and I have been hearing these strange noises from the room above us. It sounds like this people are having sex like the bed is moving or something. We're not sure yet, but I think we're going to go up there and see what's going on. We thought it was a laundry room, but who knows. I've been trying to find this song. I know the tune of it. I just can't place the words so I'm having no luck. I'm just adding words that sound good. I heard it in my brother's car, but he was talking and I didn't want to interrupt. I'm looking at some pictures on my wall. Wait. someone just sent me a text message. It was a guy named David. I met him last Sunday walking passed his room. He seems like a nice guy. We went out last night to a movie in Dobie. We got there early so we had about an hour and a half to spare. So, we decided to take a look around Dobie's room so we just started knocking on doors and taking a look at people's rooms. It was crazy, but I liked it. Nothing was planned out. We just started hanging out and then we thought a movie would be nice and just went. It was excited. I hate having things planned out. I don't mind just sitting at home and being lazy. Just taking things when they come along. I don't know if. damn, I hate pop-ups. one just popped up while I was typing. Anyways. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad. Well, I have about a minute left and that David guy is coming over. Perfect timing. I think things happen for a reason. I'm into reading horoscopes and stuff like that. I guess it's kinda childish.

"Gosh, I'm so tired right now. Crazy. and oh so overwhelmed with school. I mean how much reading could I possibly get this semester. I hate having vision problems. it just feels like everything is this world is working against me. I mean the blind people get all of their books on tape before me. well reality check. I CAN'T READ MY BOOKS EITHER. I guess I could make a big stink about it. because by law they have to arrange for me to get assistance for my disability. but its too much hassle and I already feel really uncomfortable about my disability. I mean. I just hope that if I transfer schools that they will give me more individualized assistance. something UT has no idea how to do. Why do I hate my roommate so much. I think I need therapy for how much I hate her. I actually get a pang in my stomach when I know she is at the apartment. that is a major problem. adn when I go into my apartment I close my bedroom door in order to say don't even try to talk to me"""". and the really really sad thing is that I don't think she has a clue how much I hate her. I haven't had this much rage towards someone since 11th grade. and those are the only two people in my whole entire life that I have ever hated. Staci and my spanish teacher . Its weird some people just rub me the wrong way and there is  no forgiving them. I get along with everyone. I mean everyone. so for me to have an enemy it is actually quite odd. I wonder why dan and vab always have to act like they are cool and don't care about stuff. It actually really bothers me. I mean, for God's sake, show some freaking emotion. Its so ridiculous. ummm have I mentioned how tired I am?  my eyes are closing on me. I really need to get more sleep in the future. I wonder if I really should transfer schools. I mean. that would mean moving back into my parents house. that would mean I can't come home drunk. I can't bring guys back to just hang out. gosh. all the fun stuff I do here would have to end. but then you just weigh that against my future. I mean I think if I got more assistance for my disability, I would go farther in life. which obviously is my ultimate goal. No one even knows I can't see well. I hide it so well,. I've known people for 3 years and they still don't know. I mean. they'll make fun of my vision but they never put 2 and 2 together. I wonder if I would if I was in there position?          oh my gosh. I'm soooooooo tired. now my eyes are burning. is this a sick joke?  I still have like 8 minutes to go. I don't know if I'm going to make it. my money situation is horrible. I seriously spend too much money on alcohol. I mean I spend so much freaking time studying during the week, that I feel like I  DESERVE to go out on the weekends. ya know. so I just spend my money on that. so why isn't it raining outside?  It was raining so magnificently last night. I love it when it pours rain. I reminds me of my dad. We always would go outside on our patio when it would thunder and lightning and just watch it. It was always so amusing to me and my sister and I would always have father-daughter bonding time. I miss my dad. why does he have to live in Egypt anyways. What a joke. my family does not deserve that one bit. Thank God he has a good and secure job though. otherwise I would be at a community college instead of UT right now. only 4 minutes to go. ummm. yep. once again I am tired. I got invited to a party tonight. I kinda don't want to invite dan. cause he always acts like he is too cool. when in all reality I'm too cool for him. so he feels like he has to act that way in order to compensate. Why is Suneal GAY. He is such the perfect guy for me. that royally sucks. Aren't there any straight wonderful gentlemen still left in this world of ours. I sure haven't found them. /. oh my!  1 minute. yippee        honestly that was a very excruciatingly long 20 minutes. I think you could have gotten the stream of consciousness point across by making it 10 minutes. but whatever        times up. oh darn!        peace out         ",1
"I am sitting at my desk at work. I should be doing other things. I'm angry for having to work today. This should be a day off. I could have taken it off but then I wouldn't get paid. No paid vacation for part time. I am tired even though I got a good amount of sleep last night. I really  shouldn't be tired. I don't feel like going to the gym this afternoon but I wil. I go the gym five days a week and I don't know why. I really don't see any real difference in my body. I started going really to improve myself but I have noticed no change in the several months I've been there. Never the less I still go everyday. I guess I'm just hoping it will pay off. I would really like a nap. Even if i skip the gym and go straight home I can't take a nap. I have homework to do. Not really required home work but reading and prepairing for classes this wek. I am realy trying to stay on top of all my classes this semester. If I slakck off I'll have serious problems in some of my courses. I'm not really sure if this is what I should be writing about. I'm just writing about what I'm thinking about as I sit here tyoing away. The more I think about it these are pretty normal thoughts for me. Most days I am tired and want to skip going to the gym. And most days I still go to the gym. Despite not seeing results I'm not what I would call discouraged. I never think of quiting going to the gym, I just wonder why I see no difference. And everyday I think about all the things I have to do at home that evening. What checks I need to write for bills. I need to write my rent check tonight. I also need to elt my roommates know that the electric and water bill is due soon. I need to change the elevtric and water bil out of my name because I am moving. Thats another thing I have to do when I get home tonight. I havve to start deciding waht I can fir into my new apartment and what I have to store or sell. These are all really basic thoughts for me. I'm always thinking ahead and planning what needs to be done at night or tomorrow or nex week etc. I am very organized, maybe too much if there is such a thing. I dion't really know anyone who is as organized as me. My mother doesn't call me organized she calls me controlling and anal retentive. I prefer organized and in control. I'm not always in control, but she doesn't know that. I don't tell her how out of control I feel in my relationship with my boyfriend. This is also another normal daily thought for me. Why I stay with someone who doesn't feel the same for me as I do for him. Or at least he is not sure. I often wonder if I'm stupid for staying, or is it just him who is tupid because he can't figure out what he wants or what he feels. Maybe its both. Thinkng about how much time I give to my boyfriend and how to limit that time is also a normal daily thought for me, at least lately. I am a planner, I like to know what the plans are for tonight or tomorrow night or the weekend. He doesn't make plans with anyone until that evening arrives. I've gotten to expect that from him but I can't say I've gotten use to it. I wish he would tell me his plans ahead of time but I know that he won't so I'm learining to adapt. I guess it is probaly good for someone like me to be with someone who makes her just relax. I know that everything doesn't have to be planned but for some reason I do try to plan everything I can. Controlling the caos I guess, or to try to control the best I can. I am really out of daily thoughts. I don't know what else to say. writing for twenty minutes straight is hard. My thought are just normal. I am listening to the radio and I don't know this song. Not that it matters I just leave the radio on at work for some background noise. Oh wait, I do know this song. I just didn't recognize it at first. I have a lot of reading to do tonight that I'm not looking forward to. Biology mostly. M developmental calss looks like it will be challenging but possibly very enjoyable. Who am I kidding, by the end of the semester very few classes are enjoyable they are just over and I am always glad just to pass. As orgainsed as I am  I sometimes feel overwhelmed at the beging of the semester trying to get everything organised and figure out what classes to give studying priority to. I usually study first the class I have next. I will fo home and read biology before I read psychology because I have biology tomorrow and psychology is not until wednesday.     ",0
"I've never done this before, but hey, whatever. College is all about new stuff, and this is a lot better than some of the other assignments I've had to do so far for classes. I don't really know what to say. I just got done emailing my sister who teaches at a college in San Antonio. I miss her. And borrowing her clothes. I miss my little sister, too. It's funny because I didn't think I'd really miss my family and most of the time I don't, but the other night I just got this sporadic mental picture of my Dad. It was like he was standing in front of me, and it made me want to cry. It sucks that he won't ever really be able to help me with physics or chemistry or any of my hard classes again. Such is growing up. So, no one's going to read this. That's pretty good because I'm just writing crap right now and it's all very random and nonsensical. I love that word. I try and use it whenever I can. Ha! This is crazy. Actually, Pennebaker's class is one of the best I have this semester, but that's mostly because he's so funny. I only took it because this girl I know said she knew Pennebaker's daughter and that she'd been to dinner at his house or something and he was really funny. And he is. And he speaks on topics that are at least interesting, but then again, most psych stories are interesting. I mean, some of my professors are crazy. I have this one professor who barely speaks English, which is cool and all, but really, how can I learn from someone I can't understand? And the really bizarre part is that at the end of every sentence, he says, """"In Asia. """" At least, that's what it sounds like he's saying to me, and I've discussed this with several other people in my class and they all think he says something like that, too. I don't get it. Does he mean that only certain bacteria grows in Asia? Because that's what we're studying right now. Bacteria. And it's not even interesting. I mean, who really cares about ERs and lipids and lysosomes? Well, I guess that's a pretty dumb question. Of course, botanists and biology people and premed students care. I personally want to cry every time said professor goes on a schpiel about protein in the cells. Really, guy. But I have to take the class, whether I want to or not. I only need a few more hours of science, anyway, and so next semester, I'll probably be taking rocks for jocks. Ah, geology. My eyelids are getting heavy just thinking about it. After this, I have some serious catching up to do. And it's not because I miss my classes or anything. I mean, I don't even drink. Except for wine, and that's really only when I eat out, which I do less and less these days. These dayswhat am I talking about?! I've been here for less than a month. It feels like I've always been here, though. Which is weird. I love Austin, except for all the drag rats, who are stinky and mean. Seriously, they're nasty. And what's with the way they all act like they're homeless? They're not, most of them anyway. My neck hurts. That professor I was talking about earlier, the one who speaks English very poorly? He sings in class. Right in the middle of class, he'll just bust out with a song. And it's not like he's singing to himself. I mean, he's wearing a mike. We can all hear him loud and clear. And the only song he knows how to sing is """"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning. """" Except that he garbles all the words up and it's so charming. He's like a little boy, except that he's kind of old, and not as cute as a little kid singing. Anyway, if it weren't for him singing that song all wrong, I would never go to class. That's pretty weird of me, right? ",0
" Hi, my name is Ashlee Vicars and I am a new student at the University of Texas in Austin. I absolutely love it here! It is so much more than I expected. I am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here. I didn't know anyone here when I came so I decided to go through the rush process and go greek. I was very disappointd in the greek system. They are so political here in Austin. I felt like I was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents didn't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush. A lot of the legacy stuff didn't make sense to me. Oh well, I ended up pledging Alpha ChiOmega and I absolutely love it !  The sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun!  I have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already. Right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and I am typing this for my new psych class. I am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend. We were together for the past year and I was so in love with him, but he was 21 and I was 18 and that 's not a bad age difference, but he just wanted to party all of the time, which is okay, but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me. That also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so I broke up with him. But I still miss him so much. But moving to Austin is a good thing for me because I am away from everyithing from back home and I can start all over. He wasn't good for me at the time. Hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out, but until then I am not putting up with that and i can do better. I love the new girls in my sorority, they are so sweet!  It made me think of that because  a new friend of mine Jill, knew Jacob, my x-boyfriend, and they were friends their senior year. Its knda crazy becasue I am from Pottsboro, an hour north of dallas, she is from Plano, and he is from Prosper. I met Jacob at the lake when I was modeling for a swimsuit store. We fell in love and spent the next year together. ANyways, i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me. Everytime I talk to them they arelik how are yoyr grades?  When it has only been 2 weeks and this is like the first assisnment I have turned in. They are so worried that I am just down here partying and not going to class. I don't know why they think that because coming to UT has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl!  I am so happy here!  My mom got upset with me last night  becasue i told her I was going to the Tulane vs. Texas game in New Orleans and she said no, and I said well I'm old enought to make my own decisions now. Why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun?  And then I was going to eat dinner at 10:00 at night and she flipped out on me because I had class the next day. She is being unreal. And I havne't talked to my dad in over a week because we just argue about how i should be using my time wisely at college. I don't even want to go home and visit anymore. I have always had a good relationship with both of myparents so I don't know why now it is a problem. I love them to death but I just can't talk to them for a couple of days. My roommate is cool, but she sometimes gets on my nerves. She never cleans up after hersolf and she always has one of her two boyfriend over here (that don't know about one another) and she is sleeping with both of them and then asks me to cover for her. but at the same time she is doing their laundry here and being inconsiderate of me. I don;'t know, i'm just really stressed out right now. MY new friends here ar eawesome though. I guess I keep talking about them because this is the first time in 7 years that I havene't had a serious boyfriend. But I like the single life sometimes, I don't have to answer to anybody or call in and check in with anyone anymore. My friends just fight with their boyriends all of the time. I came from a small town where you were able to be involved in everything. I played basketball, ran track, softball, was a cheerleader all thourhg school, did student council, sisters of service, fellowship of christian athletes, and took a few leadership roles and it was great. But a lot of girls hated me for it. I was alway ssweet to everyone but the girls always taked bad about me because I was friends with their boyfriends or was with the guy they wantred. Now that I am in Ausitn, i don't have to worry about jelaous girls anymore. Which is so awesome. I used to come home from school and cheerleading practice crying because of some of the things the girls would say to me. THey were so hateful and mean. I loved to cheerlead, but half way through my senior year iI quit cheerleadeing because the girls got so bad. It was really messed up. I always argued with our sponsor because she didn't like me and I had no respect for her because she cheated on her husband and slept with the football coach and she was just horrible. And then she tried to date my boyfriend. This was our sponsor, what kind of authority position was she to be in?  Anyways, this is just what all is on my mind . I will make my parents happy and come home with awesome grades this semester abd they will be so proud of me!  That is my main goal in life right now!       ",1
"Well, I've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. Right now, I'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. Recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. I think Stephen was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. I just found out today that the classes I plan on taking over the next 3 and a half years will earn me a BS in Computer science, and a BS in Mathematics. At first I just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when I was talking to Dr. Turner today he told me that I should check to see how much of the major I would be completing. I hope a double major will help me get into grad school. Right now I really want to go to Carnegie Mellon to do my grad work. They have a really great CS program there. That's assuming of course that I remain a CS major over the next few years. But I don't see my interests changing or anything. I really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. We're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. Luckily this is typed and not spoken. Well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. I misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. Its really bugging me, so I think I'll go fix it right now. I know that if I look around my room I'll see something that I want to talk about. Usually that subject will be computer related. Its really sad. (Sad but true dear reader) Why does that make me think of high school. Weird flashback I guess. Never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because I had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. All extremely intelligent. I wish I could meet more intelligent people here. Most of the people I know are either average, or just plain dumb. I did meet some cool people in my CS 307 class. But its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. That reminds me of the math problem I solved today. Professor Freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. He encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. Well, so far I'm the only one I know who came up with a solution to his problem. The last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. I wrote a dinky little program in C to compute all the data, and then I pasted it all into Excel to plot it. Right now I have another program like that running. Its been running for about 140 hours right now. Something like that. Its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking. I wonder how long I've been typing. Probably at least 15 minutes. I really haven't been keeping time. Oh well, once this hits a page on size 12 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when I paste it on the web). My DVD player comes in pretty soon. I've been waiting for at least a month because the first one I got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. I need to buy some DVDs for it. Probably will get the Utena DVDs even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. I like anime. ",1

I can't I have no $$$ I have a job interview tomorrow. I hope I get the job so that I can eat and buy gas to go home and tell Truyen how I feel about her. FUCK you your never going to tell her that. Someday I will. yeah right. No If I just go to her and say, hey I really like you and I want to marry you, she will run screaming and never want to see me again. I can't do that. But I can't just sit in my biology class with all these beautiful women and think about her all my life. I need to do something. The time has expired. ",1
"I wanted to write about something traumatic that happened to me because, apparently, traumatic experiences and how to deal with them is a pretty big fandango in this class. Something just happened, though, so I want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so. The computer assistant in the theatre department (where I am right now, being a theatre major and all) just complimented me on my hat, a black fedora I bought in Greenwich Village about a year and a half ago. I was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive Experimental Theatre wing of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. After a fairly successful audition I concentrated all of my efforts of exploring, something I had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time I visited. This time I was alone, though. The time before I had my brother, eighteen months my junior and my closest friend, at my side and all was well. This time I had to w2ait a couple of days for his arrival, since he couldn't get off school and I could, being a senior and having a few excused absence """"college days"""" on my hands. So I set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of Little Italy that didn't ID and I found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of New York, stumbling upon Strawberry Fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later. After three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me. When I picked him up at the airport I noticed that I had taken to thinking of myself as a New Yorker. I had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and I related to each other. This changed over the next four days, though, as he assimilated into New York the way I had and we set out to Little Italy to begin our evenings with a little pasta, a Nat King Cole impersonator, a jug of white wine every night, and a restaurant owned by the mob.  After taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last (having just dropped twenty bucks on some Thai food that smelled like sewer filth). It was our second to last day in the city and we decided to thrift store shop and try to extend our dollars as far as they would go. Then we saw them. In a small shop in the Village (not that there aren't a billion of them) we both saw fedoras that just said """"you"""". We ended up dropping our last fifty dollars on our new hats and had to pay for our ride to the airport ( a limo, surprisingly cheaper than a taxi because it had a set fare) with a handful of quarters. We hadn't eaten for two days and there wasn't a meal of any kind on the plane (not even peanuts) so we wound up in Houston on a two hour layover with nothing to do, empty stomachs, and no money. I ended up begging, trying to sell a stack of demo tapes I had cut for two bucks a pop. I ended up selling two, and we ate the best Taco Bell that has ever been eaten by a human. I remember that the only people who bought the tapes were other musicians. Maybe it's a karma thing (""""Wow, that guy looks pathetic. Better buy his tape because that could be me someday. """")  One way or the other they understood. I was upset just because my plan was to randomly hand out this stack of tapes to people as they departed for different corners of the country, hoping that they would like it and that underground distribution would abound. Maybe it worked: I still don't know. I know it was passed around quite a bit in south Texas, but not much further than that. Oh, well. By the by, I'm really tired right now because my band played a two hour show last night. We haven't played that long in about a year, since clubs usually limit you to an hour or less. We used to go two hours without even trying when we were playing for our friend's parties, but now we've gotten lazy. Last night really woke us up. I was so drenched in sweat that I actually had to wring out my shirt after the show. We didn't even get a decent crowd until the last thirty minutes or so. That's ok. Better things will come along soon enough. We play every Thursday at Black Cat, which has no cover and is all ages. For some reason, this alone does not attract a crowd. It's really upsetting. I know we're not a bad band, so it's really frustrating when you can't talk people out of disco dancing at Bob Popular to enjoy a free show that accepts all ages and doesn't involve a DJ. Someday. About that traumatic experience. About five months ago I was hit by a car while I was crossing the street into Trudy's off Guadalupe. It was late and I was wearing all black and the guy didn't see me. I was looking the other way because I saw the car that hit me but he seemed too far away to reach me. I was more concerned about cars coming from the other direction, which is a curving road that is hard to see down. When he hit me his fender shattered my leg and I was thrown onto his windshield. He didn't brake until then and the force of him braking as I hit the windshield sent me flying into the road about twenty feet out. I never lost consciousness and never really felt all that dazed or affected by it. I just calmly looked up, announced that my """"fucking leg was broken"""" and asked one of my friends to call 911. Then I just lay down in the road waiting for the ambulance. It started to rain. That night I was taken to Brackenridge and left alone for about an hour at a time in the ER. Only one of my friends cam to visit me. She held my hand while they pieced my leg back together and set it into a cast. They had already pumped me with morphine and I heard them mumble about amputation a time or two, but eventually they settled on inserting a rod from my knee to my ankle. The morphine did nothing to me, though, because they gave it in light doses and after years of recreational drug use I wasn't really affected. That and the pain was coming from the one part of my body where intravenous drugs couldn't possibly go. I ended up just biting down on a folded-up blanket, not wanted my screams to disturb others in the ER. Over the next three days I was observed and recovered quicker than anyone imagined. My family came to be with me from San Antonio, except for my dad who was in Orlando on business. He wanted to rush to Austin to be with me but I didn't want him to see me tied up to machines and weak. I knew he couldn't handle it. After about a half hour of coaxing he stayed in Orlando. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol in twenty years after getting a kidney removed before I was born. That night he drank himself into submission. Slowly my friends from the theatre department began creeping in until I had a steady stream of visitors and a room full of flowers, candy, and porn (don't ask). The faculty came to make sure that I was alright, something I never would've expected, and one night my nurse ( a Mary Poppins sort of woman) turned my bed so that I could see the tower lit up in orange. I've never had school spirit or pride in any organization whatsoever, but for some reason I cried. For some reason I loved the sight of the tower at that moment. I've recovered completely. I was angry for a while and spent a lot of time screaming and damning anyone who could walk while I made my way around in a wheelchair. I marveled at the fact that, even when I was on crutches, nice families at the Arboretum would still pull their children closer and hold their purses tighter. I began to keep a journal, but by the time I had written five entries my anger was gone. My depression was gone. I couldn't even dwell of death, which I know I had cheated. I was just glad to be alive and to put it all behind me. Now I'm physically and emotionally recovered. I don't have nightmares and I don't fear cars. I don't know why. Maybe I'll learn that this semester. For some reason I recovered very nicely in all aspects from this whole awful little episode.  The good thing is that I'm happy and sober now. I had attempted suicide twice this past year, once just two weeks before the accident. Then I was put in a situation where I didn't try and death actually came for me, and I fought to stay alive. That's always struck me as odd. Oh well. For whatever reason I am a happier, if quieter person. Things are good. I'm looking forward to psychological experiments this year. Now I'm off. I've written for about thirty minutes and I think it's time for a cigarette. Bye bye now.   ",0
"""""antisocial""""--that is what it said in large letters as I walked into my dorm room today. Everyone on my floor thinks I am antisocial. I hate the way that people do not ever understand the difference between anitsocial and shy. I wish that people would just to understand people more and hate them less. I guess it is partially my fault. I long to meet new people and make new friends but I spend all of my time locked in my room talking to all of my old freinds that are hundrends of miles away. They are all coming to visit me tomorrow for my 19th birthday. lots of them are coming. I guess it will at least show all of the jerks on my floor that I am not as """"anitsocial"""" as they think I am. They are all so stupid anyway. All they do is get drunk every single night. How can they think so highly of themselves living that way. When do they ever study? The true is that I am jealous of them, I have always wanted to be so carefree and fun. But, I would never pick on anyone, EVER! I guess I could go out and party everynight, but that just isn't me. I would fell silly if I ever went to one of those wild parties. Besides, I am going to be a doctor, I need to stay and study. It makes me sick to imagine the possibility of not getting into medical school, it is my dream, the only thing I really want. But, I am not the most desipined student, I love to slack off and sit and play on aol. I will never get into a good medical school and then I will be lost, it is the scariest thing I have ever had to face. It is so scary that I try to protect myself. I am a diehard romantic and it is amazing that in my lowest moments I think about marrying Ty in order to secure my future. Ty is my ex-boyfreind that I would never be happy with but I in the business honors program and wil surely be rich someday. I often think that if I marry him then it will be okay if my medical school falls through. I know it would be stupid but I think it at times. What I really want is someone to sweep me off my feet, like in the movies. I love okd black and white mushy romantic movies more than anything in the world. The are so sweet and beautiful and you can always tell that they will never fall out of love and that they really will live happily ever after. Such a nice thought. I guess I cna't ask for a fairy tale but I know that I will never get a divorce. NEVER!  I was always so proud growing up that my parents never divorced. I always thought that it somehow made me better than everyone, like I had something to do with it. Well, the last day of school on my Sophmore year my mom called me into the living room and told me she was moving out. I thought I was going to die. The effects of this event have been bothering me ever since. I am so clingy now with guys I date that I drive them insane. I have this unbelievable fear of being left by those I love, and I wwent through a phase were I cried everyday for a year. I am going to be a much better parent to my kids than most. I am going to sing to them and show them hapy movies and take them to museums and plays and play games with them. I will puch them to be wonderful, but not too much. And I will make sure that every moment of their lives they know how much I love them. I can't wait to have children. I do worry thought. sometimes even the best parents can't always innfluence their kids to be good. Tonight Ty is taking me out for dinner. I invited my roommate to come with us, she said she would and I feel bad because I think it hurt his feelings that I asked her. I just can't help it. Even in high school I would invite the band director that everyody hated to walk around with us in Disney World. He looked so lonely walking by himself. I hope I find someone to appricate me being like that. ",1
"     This is kind of new and interesting. I have never done my homework like this before. I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment. Psychology is such an interesting field to study. It is my major in fact at this moment. I don't know if I will change though. The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder. With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything. I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer. I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together. I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. A dark haired man just sat near me. He didn't sit at the computer directly near me. I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really. People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway. For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. He wasn't very charming. That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't. He really isn't my type. He is in the business school. Ehh. I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'. Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money. People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner. I was that poor. I think it is because of this, I tend to value education. I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. That to me  ",1
"I'm thinking about if I am going to get the job that I want at the PAC at the university it would suck if I didn't I am proud that the OTC called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like I didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so I can't type as fast and I keep having to go back and erase but I like pressure I thrive under it but I don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words I do not like those because I am so used to using slang that I just do not type it anymore and I also hate having to capitalize my I's it makes me mad having to go back. Right now I feel a little stress because I am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday I had a meeting and I did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all I could read was Biology which is another class I don't understand I never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either I feel lost in that class it is so difficult I feel like I dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not I just keep thinking about what Prof. Pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. Like screaming I guess but the Professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home I had a divided keyboard the """"flowy"""" ones and now I have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment I like but I feel like I shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid I's and I forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the I messed me up again. Well forget it no more caps; the I's are going to be in lower case. Sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit I need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend I get to go home though I want to go to the game I have not boguht the sports package and I didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot I guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so I feel like I should go for him but I'm not going. Now I get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe I'll get sick when I go home like Prof. Pennebaker said probably because I feel the migrane coming. I hate migranes I hate having to find a job hopefully I get a good one I have an interview on Tuesday I hope it goes well and that I make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. I wonder how the bus works I keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause I have seen it once after running to the engineering building because I was late I saw the bus and I think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but I will take a look around and see if that's how it works. Now I feel like I have run out of things to say I still have to do the experiment for this class I want to do the survey but since I am under 18 I have to get my moms signature and I feel like I should be happy about going home I mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like """"huh"""" and I hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is """"kidnapped' I know I worry too much but I don't want anything to happen even if it means that I have to do all the homework, I've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was I talking about I don't kno, I need to make friends me and my roommate get along but I need other friends and now I have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends I saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart Asian in the elevator today I feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that I have are okay but I don't really relate to them why I don't kno I feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least I hope they don't and if they do I don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still I have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really I am surprised I wrote this much I thought I was going to run out of this to say but I like this assignment when Prof. Pennebaker said it I was like yes no grammar rules I don't particularly like grammar but I try I mean I suck at it in my papers I always score low on it 2 minutes and I have mentioned my time too many times I tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and I did nto so now I keep talking about NOT because I want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts I think it is the flourescent lighting I think that is how u spell that and I just put the letter u for the word you and I am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and I keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh I thought it was over but I am going to stop now because a I don't want to talk for too long and I have to go turn of this light and I am thinking about what I just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if I should put my name at the bottom but I won't because I have the code thing. well this was productive and I did not put well in caps.

" I am leaving to see my sister at the University of Oklahomea and I will also see my high school friends this weekend. It feels strange going back to my home state. I feel like I have moved on in my life and in just these past four weeks I have matured into a completely different person. I feel that by going away to school I have learned lessons I would never have acquired by going to my state school. It smells like an old lady in my room because my roomate broke a parfume bottle three days ago and the smeel seems to have resided permanently in our carpet. The smell is so strong I can barely concentrate. People in my dorm slam their doors so loudly. It could scare a person in total relaxation. I am late to leave. My friend who is driving was suposed to be here about ten minutes ago. I guess this tardiness is a good thing becaus I need to write my paper. The problem with this paper is I can't type as fast as my brain can think. I hate Instant Messenger. You have it on and people automatically think you want to talk to them. And then after you fail to respond there is this constsnt message   Are you there. . Are you there. Well, I guess you don't want to talk to me.   This isn't the case at all. It is just that I have too many things going on in my life to sit and have small talk, such as,   Oh how is school?    I need to acquire better typing skills. That parfume smell is giving me a killing headache. I am glad I am leaving this weekend. Hopefully the smell will begin to difuse into the air. Our room is pretty clean for the first time since school has started. This is probably because my roomate is also gone so, she is not here to leave all her belongings strewn across the floor. Twenty minutes is along time to write. At first you don't think it is a long time, but when you are actually up against clock it seem like eterninty. I have alot to do in the coming weeks. In two weeks, I have my first exams in all my classes. On top of having study, I don't know what the tests will be like nor do I know how to do alot of the material we are covering in chemistry. But I cannot worry about this now or else I will submitt myself into ultimate stress. Yes, I am fligthing instead of fighting. I wonder if I will get to meet up with my parents this weekend. I thought at first when they left me at school that I would miss them uncontrollabley, but in relaity I didnt even cry. I don't know if this is becaus ei just havent allowed myself to cry for them or if I am just truely subconciously ready to mvoe on in my life. My back also hurts. I don't know why it hurts, but it does. I can't remember any activity I have participated in where my back would ahve been injured. Maybe it hurts from running. I am having a mental block. ",1
"I am sitting here with my feet on my subwoofer. I should be reading psychology, my webcam isn't on right now. Jars of Clay is a good band. I don't really have much to write. Maybe I should go to the sophomore versus freshmen football game at Clark's Field right now, but I'm doing this instead. Justin Shih just IMed me. Justin told me to go play football because this assignment isn't due until the 12th and today is the 6th. I think I'm scared about falling behind in college. I've done all my calculus HW the day they came out. I never was this diligent in high school. I have nasty cough, it's been like this for a few weeks now. I hope it gets better. Two of my best friends are in Houston, I don't really have much to do without them here. I'm hungry, haven't eaten breakfast or lunch. God is bigger than the air I breathe, the world we'll leave. This is a song by Delirious?, a band from the UK. I slept in this dorm last night by myself the first time. I miss my parents and my brother. My brother is working in California, and for the first time I feel how much everything has changed. I miss my parents, they have done so much for me. I want to do well in college so that their money doesn't go to waste. I love you mom, dad. I feel a little sad that I can't see my parents whenever I want now. I can't eat dinner every night with them like I used to last year. My neck hurts. I wish I was playing warcraft III right now. I don't understand this assignment. Maybe further on in the course it'll make more sense but right now this makes none to me. These thoughts are not at all coherent. I hope I do okay on my economics quiz on monday. My poker book and chips still haven't arrived yet. I ordered them last week too. I wish people would send me care packages. My roommate just received a birthday present/care package from his girlfriend. I wish I had someone who would send me things. I've written a lot. I wonder if all the papers turned in are this long. This must suck for the TA to read. 400 students turning in non-sensical and incoherent papers. There's that cough again. I wish I could control it. My hands are tired from typing constantly. This assignment sure is long, 10 more minutes to go. I hope I get an A in psychology. if I beg for an A in this paper I wonder if it'll help. Just 9 more minutes to go. I can't think of anything else to write. Maybe this music is throwing off my concentration. Jars of Clay is now playing. they're a good band. Didn't I write about them earlier? Oh well. People don't call me, I wish someone calls me. I'm tired, I could use a nap although I woke up at 1:30 today. I wonder what Michael, one of my best friends, is doing. I should go to his room after this. Just 7 more minutes. I can't wait until this thing is over. Time sure goes by slowly when you're counting it down. I need to go to sleep early tonight, got to wake up early tomorrow. EV Free church is good. I need to check out Austin Chinese Church too though, to see how each compares to each other. I need to do my quiet time today, before I forget. Sometimes I feel like such an inadequate Christian, I have so many failures. I guess no one is perfect. I wonder what my brother's doing right now. It's 1 o'clock or so in California. I wonder if he likes it there. I wonder if I really like it in Austin. or if it's just an illusion. I think I like it here. I have friends, I think, things to do. I don't know. It's all so confusing. Sometimes I just want to hermit and not have social contact at all. I like to live in a big city such as New York because it's busy, but yet I don't' like loitering in big crowds or hanging around large groups of people. I wonder if that's weird, or maybe I just feel inadequate around large groups of people who I don't know. Like last night at CBS I didn't know a lot of people and I drifted from group to group loitering but did not feel like I belonged. Just 3 more minutes left to go in this assignment. It cannot go by any slower. I should go eat something after this. But then dinner is coming up soon. I hope I have time to get some more studying done this afternoon, or maybe tonight. I wonder if this is the longest paper turned in. probably not, there're some girls who can write nonstop. They probably double the length of what I wrote. I wonder if I am even doing this assignment correctly, I don't know how to track my thoughts or feelings, it's like I'm writing in a journal. Oh well. I can't be penalized for trying. just 30 more seconds to go. let's count it down    30    29    28    27    26    25    24    23    22    21    20    19    18    17    16    15    14    13    12    10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    done ",1
"so I'm sitting here. I don't know what to talk about. except for the fact that the latest mars volta cd is amazing. I especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music. its panned all different kinds of ways to where if you're listening to it in a portable cd player or anything that has a distinct sound system you can notice all these minute details that they have injected in there. any other way would require you to have incredibly sharp hearing sense. I can't believe I have a kitten now. my mom told me to take care of it and get a job to support it. I just laughed at that. is it getting hot in here? I swear. one second I'm cold and the next I'm burning up. and for some reason I'm having a hard time typing right now. I think its because of the temperature. that and lack of knowledge of what to say. my cat is crawling up my leg and meowing right now. I wonder what it is that she wants. I wonder why the mars volta decided to say now I'm lost"""" as the most definitive part of the chorus. its pretty great anyways. aww. the cat wants to snuggle in my lap. too cute. I'm going to have to do so much reading tonight. sheish. so many classes and concepts to keep up with. something smells like kitty litter. uggg. kitten. she needs to stop biting me. ahh. she is going to tear my sweater. that is my favorite sweater! I've been everywhere and through everything in this black sweater. I started out with it during my emo days of high school and then grew up wearing it. good times and bad, I've worn this sweater. man. I can't wait until I have my interview with saul williams. its going to be so rad. I can't wait to do research on him so that I can know about every little detail to talk about. hold on. I need to take the sweater off. great. right when I decide to do that the air conditioning decides to come on. just my luck, it always works out this way. I wonder if I could ever get my poetry published. it would be amazing to claim that I wrote a book or compiled just a whole bunch of all the poetry I've written. sometimes I get paranoid that someone's going to copy and steal it since I have it online. not a good idea rola. boy I really like this song. I wish I could write songs this amazing. I just wish my band didn't decide to split. they did it and didn't tell me. lead singer slash guitar player is the last to find out. really genuine folks. that is how life decides to roll the dice though. man, that party after the mars volta showithsaul williams interview is going to be killer. that is, if anyone decides to drive 3 hours and spend the weekend here. hopefully they will. that would be crazy. I need a band again. we need to get our dang cd mastered already so that I can play it on the radio. I need to remember to get one of joey's cds when I'm back in irving so that I can get them to play that on the radio. man, I really hope he gets signed soon. he is so talented and puts so much effort into everything he does. it just feels like he gets nothing out of everything. all the sacrifices he makes and all the time he spends, and he just ends up getting screwed over by life in the end. I wish I could make everything better. I wish I were a magic fairy who could wave a magic wand and make all of his dreams come true so that he wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. I wish I could do that for anyone. I could pick who's deserving or not. that wouldn't be fair though since I wouldn't be deserving of making such decisions myself. dang I'm so philosophical. good thing that is my major. uh oh. I told a psychology write-up that I'm a philosophy major. I'm assured to fail now. eh. I'm so tired. I wish I could get more sleep. it was pretty nice to talk about depression today. hah. I used to be depressed. severely. I'm so glad that all of that is in the past. its nice to look back and learn about yourself. I'm such a changed person. and I keep changing. and I keep analyzing myself and noticing different things about myself from day to day that surprise me and don't surprise me. I wish more people at school knew me. I've always been the person to walk the halls and have everyone know my name but me not know anyone else's name. that is my deal. people would know me. it sucks that this college can't be like that. what? in like fifty five thousand people? you're lucky if you find your own hand in that many people. the buses are so annoying. everytime I walk up to the dang bus stop and stand in front of the doors it just leaves without me. like it knows when I'm about to come so that it can leave. that is how the buses here in austin know when its time to leave the stop. they just see me coming and its the all-time cue. that is what they teach the new bus drivers in training. if they ask """"so when do we leave?"""" they say """"when rola comes. """" my head itches. press the """"finish"""" button when you're done. twenty dang minutes is a long ace time to keep writing nothingness. its all good in the hood, I have like less than 6 minutes to go. w00t! you know. it seriously sucks that people suck. I wish people could be a whole lot nicer than they are. but what is nice anyways? gosh. we can go all philosophy on that as it is. spend like an hour and a year on that subject alone. screw it. I'm not in the mood to analyze anything. I'm just so tired. and that kitten won't quit messing with the blinds. if only I could stop typing this, get up, and stop that. she is making the blind strings look like snakes from where I'm sitting. and now the string is caught in her paw. just great. its like I'm babysitting. no, it feels like I'm a mom now. just more and more responsibility for me. but she is so cute that its worth it. man. I wish I could play an amazing guitar riff like the one I'm hearing right now. I miss playing music a lot every week. I miss being on stage. gosh I wish I had that feeling right now. ultimate bliss. no! instead I'm sitting here typing this stupid thing so that I can get credit in psychology. I better make a freaking A in this class or I'll be so pissed it will be the end of the world and destiny at the same time. if anyone read what I'm typing right now. I'm sure they would pee in their pants from how afraid they would be that a person like me exists. they're probably getting a lot weirder responses than this though. right? RIGHT? less than one minute and I'm a free-bird! and that is not a pun! whoever yells to play that at shows. dude. you're so behind on the times! that is like the oldest thing to say ever. you're just joining the masses when you submit to saying that at every show you go to. tradition or not.

"Good Morning. Eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours. They say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but I feel ten is a little more at par. I'm trying to wake up so the music of the late Elliott Smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to. It's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, I don't think I could have got  better roommates. I love sitting at my laptop when I wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath. Our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying. It's absurd really. So monday night I found out from some of my friends in College Station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there. Damn Aggies. can't live with them, can't kill them. It's a cruel world. But I'll be better off without her I think. I talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart. Where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit. But you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face. But I suppose it's like Morgan Freeman says in the movie Seven, """"love costs, it takes effort. """" That's true. Back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves. He told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases. For instance Alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt. God she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author. But she has no conscious knowledge of art. Ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money. And well obviously she doesn't know what """"love"""" really is. But then again maybe I don't either. But I know I loved her, I believed her lies. I bought the  false love she was selling for cheap. I still love her I suppose, I can't deny it. But she loved herself, before she loved me. And now I have to do the same. I have to be strong and let time heal all. Another thing  my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing. Like I was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life. She had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing. And I quote Ben Harper, """"So many people to love in my life, why do I worry about one?"""" I know there are better people out there so. And I have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever. I honestly felt bad after I chewed her out and she was crying. Try and figure that one out. I suppose I'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last. But I don't believe that saying. Nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end. I believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them. I'm glad I don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much I enjoy college compared to high school. High school, what a joke. You are not pushed, you are not inspired. In high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd. To conform and be normal. I always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country. But then again I am just one person. So I try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by. I guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace. I try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions. I think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not. For instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car. Just relax and roll down the windows and cruise. But if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable. It's sad when people don't care important issues. I guess I just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc. I think life is a crazy thing. A conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action. I think that maybe one day, I'll have all the answer, and then I will die. Maybe  one day I will find a love that is true. Maybe. Maybe I think too much.       ",0
"I am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, I have mono. Soon I will find out whether or not I have strep throat. In fact , I need to call the medical center hotline later, although I guess it really doesn't matter that much because I am already taking penicillin. Last night I could not sleep at all I was in so much pain. I would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. But, then about an hour later I would wake up and wish I was dead, not literally, but I just wish the pain would go away. I can deal with feeling sick all the time because I know that will eventually go away. I have so much stuff I need to do still, but I never have the energy to do it. I miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, I guess that is part of growing up. Texas plays Rudgers this weekend here and I already have my tickets, I wonder what that whole day will be like. I also miss all of my friends from high school, but I got two letters 2 days ago. I always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. Even when I was a little kid I would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. I was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and I argued all the time. But, now I seem to really miss them, I think because I am sick I miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when I was sick. I wonder how my brothers are doing, I haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. Everything here at UT is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. The people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. I hope I can actually make good grades in my Calculus class, which is really hard. I guess  I need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. Computers are really interesting. They seem like part of the """"system"""" and red tape involved in everything. Not that I don't appreciate or like technology, It just isn�t personal at all. I need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why I think I miss my family, they were always there to talk to. I know I can graduate from college, but I sometimes wonder whether or not I really can. I also wonder about the many paths my life could take. Will I be truly happy in the future? Will somebody love me enough to marry me?  Will I ever find a person I want to marry. What job will I have, how much money will I make. Will I be as successful as my Dad?  Can I live up to all of the expectations of my family?  Sometimes I see answers to these questions, I don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination?  I feel like time is passing and I am not really making an impact. ",1
"I am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. I like that movie 50 first dates. I said that because I'm watching t. v. oh I already said that. well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. I pray to God that she's. I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer. I watching the monk. I love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it. I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown. I am almost half way through this writing assignment. I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them. I forget how many hours I need. Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 5 hours. I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel. I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. Derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. I hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on BET. I got to find something a little better to watch. I just changed to what not to wear. I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress. I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling. I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery. I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. I would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because          ",1
"     Well i just got back from Houston, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though Austin isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 30 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from Houston. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. Danielle, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get HBO here my mom taped the last 2 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no HBO! Hopefully Emily gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 14 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. ",1
"Well, I'm sitting here at my computer on my desk thinking about what to write  gosh I cannot spell right now  this is really frustrating. It's different when you type this kind of assignment because when you write things on paper, you don't have to worry about misspelling anything because you are writing and when you type, sometimes your fingers don't type the right keys and everything gets all messed up. Well I'm going to see my boyfriend in about a week and a half my hands and fingers are getting tired of typing  and his picture is right here on top of my desk. He is so wonderful. I wish we weren't at different colleges. It would be so much easier if we were in the same city so we could see each other more often, It's only been 3 minutes since I've been doing this and I have 17 more minutes this is going to be a really long assignment. It seemed easy when I heard about it, but it really isn't that easy. My fingers really hurt and I wish I could just write this out, but I guess you have to have it in email format. Well I'm really anxious to see my boyfriend. Every time I think about him I get a really big smile on my face. I told him that even when I talk to people, sometimes I'll just smile in the middle of what I am saying because I'm thinking about him. He's in Houston, going to Rice. I was really interested in Rice a couple of years ago because my cousin, who's 4 years older than me, went there and he really liked it there. Anyway, I've been trying to book a bus ride over there, but it's pretty hard to do that, especially when I'm trying to juggle my tine between trying to book the ride and going to class and everything like that. But hopefully it'll all work out ok. It's going to be really fun because I haven't seen him since he left for Houston on August 20th. It's been so long since I've seen him. We talk on the phone occasionally, but that gets really expensive really quickly and so most of the time we just email each other and I'M each other. But his schedule is so different from mine and its hard to talk especially when I need to study but I really want to talk to him. It's so hard. Ands all this studying is getting me tired. It's only the 4th day of class and already I feel burned out from all the reading and everything ok  I think it's been about 11 minutes, uh oh  I stopped writing because I lost track of how long I have been writing but now I know so that's' good. Gosh my fingers hurt. I've never typed this much before with out taking a break. Aye ok, I need to get my wrist pad because they hurt. All right, that's better. Now, back to Jake  that's his name. He's supposed to get online again at midnight and I really hope he does. He's been going to bed really early lately and it sucks because then I can't talk to him as much as we normally talk. I love him so much. It hurts inside to think of him and I really want to be with him right now. But I don't want to talk about that to you because it's my problem, that's why I'm going to see him next Friday. I'm so excited to see him. He's seriously the best thing to happen to me for a really long time. We've gone out before, actually my freshman year of high school we were dating and we've been going out off and on since then. I seriously think we were made for each other. He is so sweet and he's really in touch with his sensitive side, and that really turns me on in a guy. I like it when guys cry too. I mean, not too much, because then it seems like they're too sensitive, but if he cries a little, it means he's sensitive and that totally turns me on. Anyway, I'm probably leaving next Thursday so that I can spend the night with my other friend, Pam, who also goes to Rice. I'm going to go to a party on Friday night with her and Jake and then I'll spend the next two nights with Jake (but we aren't going to do anything) that's another thing I really admire about him is that we both have the same morals and expectations and he is really sensitive to my feelings and wants. He has got to be the best thing going for me right now  besides of course being at UT. That is really awesome too. Anyway, I'm running about of things to say, oops that didn't make much sense, but I'm almost done  hooray! Anyway, I'm staring at my really bright yellow hilighter right now and It hurts my eyes. I need to go pick up my football tickets tomorrow after my philosophy class because I'm in the draw. I wonder how I can get 8 tickets besides mine  that makes a total of 9 tickets. My whole family is coming up to Austin for the Houston game on the 23rd because my birthday is the 24th and we are celebrating it that Saturday. Well, it's been about 20 minutes so I guess my first official psychology writing assignment is done. That makes me feel good. Well, bye! ",1
"I wish that I could type more quickly, so that I would be able to follow my thoughts. I should take a typing class like don said he did. That makes me think of my trip to Mexico, look. there is a picture of that trip on my desk. I am glad that I got into san jac!Hopefully the spirits will accept me. Man, I forgot to put my name on the back of that picture. I hope that they do not disqualify me for that. I don't want to get rejected. I cannot believe that I got those scholarships. I am glad that I did, because Lauren did. I got more proportionally than she did. It shouldn't really matter. Well it does. I can hear the movie on behind me. I love the 80s movies like this one. I like the kevin Smith movies too. Jay and Silent Bob was disapointing. I liked Kate and Leopold. I wish that I could have true love. I do not think that I really believe in it any more. I want to, but I can not trust other people enough. I think that it is my father's influence. He always says that you can fall in love with anyone that you choose to love. I Hate that. I hate that he told me that so many times when I was young. I hate how my parents fight all the time. I hope that they do not get a divorce. That would be horrible for ray ray. Poor guy. I do not even know if Daddy cares about him. I know he loves him, but he does not really like him. I can try to make up for that. If we were orphans I would take care of him and lauren. I think that i wish that we were orphans sometimes. Just so that there was something worthwhile in my life. I have not done anything in y life. There is almost nothing different in the world because of me. This is a depressing line of thought. I should try to be happy. I always think that unhappiness is a weakness. Another gift from my dad. He does not even know that I think about that stuff. Xena is awesome. I wish that I had some kind of powers. I think I might be able to have paranormal dreams. Maybe I just want to so badly. I wish that magic was real. I would give alot to have some real magic in my life. I think that I am starting to doubt my faith. I do not feel very bad about it either. I stayed up till six am last night. I hope that I can sleep tonight. I am going home next weekend. Some people are not going home for a long time. Just at Thanksgiving. MMMM thanksgiving rules. I am glad that my family loves and misses me, and that I can miss them. I hope that I can meet alot of people while I am here. I want to be in love. I want to have adventure. And I want everyone to know it. I wish I could be famous, I wish I could be a hero. I hope that I am strong enough that I could be a hero. I am afraid that I am not strong enough. Should I keep acting strong, or be what i am. I am afraid that my friends will find out that I am not what I seem like. I wonder if they are really what they act like. I should not lie anymore. Not, actual lies, but weird ones. I love some of my friends. I used fatty. That is wrong. I have to be a better friend. I used her to make friends with her roomate. They do not like Teresa anymore for some reason. I hope that I do as well as I can here. Ihope that as well as i can do is enough.  ",0

"Psychologists. Always trying to understand how the mind works, and how it doesn't work in some cases. Can such things be understood, or are we merely deluding ourselves that knowledge of any kind can be attained?  I guess I've always found psychology to be a very pretentious field. though an interesting one. We all want to control our lives, and anticipating the actions and desires of others helps us maintain that facade of control. Perhaps I'm getting into a more philosophical realm at the moment, but that is where my thoughts take me. Is free will merely an illusion?  I've thought about this a lot. Unfortunately there are no definitive answers to this or other questions. Is there a god?  I've never heard a logically sound argument for the existence of a god. I allow for the possibility of a deity, but it certainly wouldn't be the Christian God. I think ultimately that I have to agree with the existentialists. There is no proof for or against the existence of a god, so we should stop wasting time speculating and just deal with this life. Few people can deal with that. Our fear of death makes us create religions, so that we can pretend there is some semblance of life after our earthly bodies die. These are not new thoughts, I'm just thinking on demand; my mind moves most easily to the pathways it knows, and I present some of the more coherent ideas here. Is someone actually reading this?  Do you understand that I am human?  I am not an object. I am in a body, but I am not the body alone. I am a mind, vast and complex. I am. Do you feel superior because you can analyze minds?  I ask you this, so that you can ask yourself. Do you enjoy treating people as objects?  Do you even admit in your conscious mind that you treat people as objects?  Perhaps not. It's possible that I'm being slightly unfair to you and your profession. Still, it is good to raise questions. We are all just a bit too complacent and easily controlled. I see the need for religion, but I think many of us are above that. I don't need to buy my morality from someone else. What moralists and philosophers do I respect?  Plato, for his logic. Kierkegaard, except the theism. Kant, for his explications of metaphysics and epistemology. Nietzsche, except at the end of his days. LaVey, except for his dependence on rituals and his arrogance. Psychologists and behavioral scientists?  I stay away from most. At some point I'll get back into it, but I was just too turned off by Freud and his pretentious assumptions. Other reading?  Fiction, lots of it. I would name a few dozen authors but then why subject myself to the judgments of someone I can't even see. Music. I find music to be very important. You can't get by without music. And you can't just listen indiscriminately either. I think a real understanding of notes, rhythms, chords, and instrumentation is required before one can say anything about any kind of music. Do you understand music?  How are you reacting to my questions?  You must be used to asking the questions instead of having someone else ask them. Are you getting anything out of this?  Is this more interesting than most responses to the same assignment, or do you even care?  Are you turning to a colleague and saying """"hey, this kid was actually making a futile attempt to understand my motives. """"  Fun with role reversals!  I considered producing a surreal and rambling narrative for this assignment, but then you might have taken that a bit too seriously (""""bob, we got another wacko here""""). Ah well, time passes and other pursuits await. Goodbye for now.  ",0
"Stream of consciousness, I can't even spell it right, in any case I'm sitting here its 10:50 in the morning and I do not feel like doing all this crap today. too many classes when I'd rather just sit here doing nothing whatever its stupid anyway I feel like sleeping or some nonsense. nose itched. anyway I wonder what I'm going to do tonight about all that homework good god its exhausting I should taken less hours or at least not calculus that class it kicking me in the butt, I don't know anything. tangents. velocity. who freaking cares I'm no physicist, but for some reason to be an economist I need to know how to calculate velocity of a ball and decide what dosage to give patients based on tangent and secant line. honestly I don't care  I just want to get out there and keep going. chris is probably at school right now, I wonder what he is doing. oh he is in government, he better be bringing that C up to a B right now on that test. if he just tried he could be so much smarter but I distracted him and made him get the c to begin with, but its still his fault. damn nose. whatever. I just want him to do well on this one. I like it when he is smart but I don't always because I begin to feel inferior. in any case, I love him no matter how he is I just wish he had help himself more. he is working tonight, so we can do something this weekend, I paid like 50 bucks last weekend because he had no money,  its not like I'm rich. I work for my money I took out loans. my dad has not had a job since he got out in 8 months. I'm not rich. he starts his job on october 1 so that is really good because my family will be a lot better off. its quite exciting for us since we've had such little money for a while now. I'm not going to get stuck up because of it either. I wish someone would send me some mail  I check that stupid box everyday and I don't get anything why can't someone just send something to be nice  beth got a box and I still have not gotten anything. just a fucking postcard or something would be nice. oh well. ill mail someone something first then they'll have to write back, or not. I like my penguin picture, he is waving but he looks sad. I'm sorry penguin. thirsty. yuck. that cherry coke is disgusting, it tastes like carbonated water. gross and I paid 85 cents for that shit. what is up with my face itching while I?m writing this stuff. ooo. I'd rather be playing my game right now, although I really should be working out ill never be ready for thr PFT like this. can't do all those pushups and I don't know how fast I run. ill run till I vomit I guess. nose ITCHES AGAIN. I love chris he is such a nice boyfriend. not like those other guys who didn't really treat me right. chris is not perfect but he has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship and madison and all the shit that caused. in any case, we are happy now and madison can kiss my ass. he asked me to marry him in a sense that we aren't engaged but we will marry each other, we're moving in pretty soon together,  I wish he had stop being such a mama's boy and tell her to get over it. I'll probably be the one that convinces her to pay for it and be happy about it. saves a lot of money and chris and I can be together. we fight and stuff but its never big stuff. my parents will be fine with it. my dad will take a while to get used to it but my mom will support me if I really want it. it saves like 300 a month by doing it this way. MY NOSE!. 15 minutes. u got to be kidding me   this should be over by now. he should make it 15 minutes for next semester's class. actually 25. I want them to work more than I did. lalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalallllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. your my best friend. oooooooooo  youre more than a lover there could never be another to make me feel the way you do. oooooooooo  we just get closer fall in love all over. what a good song love that tim mcgraw his wife is cute too such a cute couple. jamie just got online. that girl does not know how to have fun whatever. choochoochoo. my brain feels pretty blank. I'm all thoughted out, I got class in 52 minutes and I don't feel to good from that stuff. in 3 days I take AFOQT, and then go home and see my family and chris  fun times, ill work too make some money for this week and buy that cute Aeropostale sweater. so cute 40% off too hope I don't miss that sale, I don't have a car to go buy it now or else I would, I can't wait to get my truck in like a month when my dad starts his job  a blue f-150 so pretty ",1
"Twenty minutes seems long, I wonder what the footbal game will be like. I miss my best friend. I'm glad to be going home next weekend. My own bed. It is lonely when no one is around me. WOnder what my roomate is doing? Why is my floor so quiet right now? I'm glad I don't want to be around anyone right now. I hope clubbing is fun tonight because I do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in Jester. WOnder if I'll transfer next year? I hope I get into the busines school, but at the same time if I don't I have an excuse to leave Texas. I miss Connecticut. Autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in Texas? I hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. I just want to be back in my comfortable bed in Connecticut not in Plano texas. I know I must be upset because I could barely eat at lunch. Why has no one called me today? I call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. Oh, this is my favorite part of this song. I am gald I decided to put on Dave Matthews while I did this. I wonder if my cats miss me? I bet they miss onnecticut too. I hope I meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. I hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because I suck and I don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. I am praying that I don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. I do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but I like to know a guys name, maybe his major. Now I am getting too worried about the thing maybe I should stay at home. No, I will not do this to myself again, I can't this is completely ridiculous. Just because I don't know these people too well doesn't mean that I can hide from the world. how am I going to get know these people better if I don't go and do these things. IHOP was fun last night and I tought it wouldn't be. I am glad I got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. I think that I am loosing weight, I should be because I have been eationg a lot less since I have been here. No snacking for me!!! Plus I walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 15. But I could do with out the heat. That seems like a little too much for me. It never was that hot in Connecticut. Okay, maybe, but I just miss it up there. All my friends, even though they are at college. I wish it was senior year again. Everything was so much less complicated then. Now I feel as though I will never have everything that I did there. I tried to appreciate it all when I had it, but I didn't appreciate it enough. I had so much and even though I still have the memories I miss it all so much. I know it won't be the same when I go back, but I miss the security that I felt there. I know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but I do not want to have all this growth I happy with myself and what I was and don't want to change. Maybe if I am lucky I'll be able to graduate in three years. I already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. I miss Mrs. Jestin and even Dr. Dennis. Why can't I just adjust and love everything? well I guess I just have to keep on doing what I am doing and that is that. all I know is that I will never forget what I left behind. ",0
"it is about 93% hispanic and 5% anglo and 3% other. my house is an hour west of south padre island, where my family owns a condo at suntide I and a sailboat in which we dock it at the sea ranch. I will arrive home aroung four thirty or five to go back to my highschool and surprise my boyfriend jason. he will be practising basketball when iget there because he doen't expect me home till six. then I will go home and see my mom, sister,and dog cocoa. cocoa is a chocolate lab that has been missing me very much . she gets extreemly excited every time my boyfriend goes over thinking that I should be around there some where. around seven I will leave  to go to about an hour of a football game. see the cheerleading squad that I miss and the band march which I miss just as much. then from there iwill leave and go to the beach, with jason. my mon and sister willalready be there. when I get there my mom promised to bbq my favorite foods, since the dorm food has already gotten old. then at the beach I will spend quality time with my family and take cocoa for walks on the beach, where she loves to run in the ocean and chase sea gulls. I most importantly can't wait to take those long romantic walks on the beach at night with my boyfriend, whom I love and miss very much. on saturdaymy dad and little brother will meet us there after the hunting trip. sunday my  neighbors will come down. they are my family down there because our closest relative is in wisconsin. they will bring all there children, which adds up to seven. my boyfriends parents and little brother will also be meeting us down there as well. I can't wait to spend time with all those people, and  tell them about my new family up here. I just got into a sorority, a week ago tomorrow. alpha delta pi  is the one that I got into, and I love it. they make us study ten hours a week at the house which I think will a positive thing for everyone. however I will miss my roommate this weekend. her name is alyssa bauer and is also a engineerig major like myself. I'm going into civil though and she is going into mechanical. but we get along very well. this is her lab top that I', writing  this assignment on right now. she is so sweet. she is even saportive of me being in  a sorority. and we went pot luck.

"     I wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, I am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy. I am surprising myself lately though. I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all. I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. I wonder when life is going to get easy. I have been working hard since I was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. Trying is the key word. Sometimes I think I missed out in high school. I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do. If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in England, Surrey was  nice. London is amazing. I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it. I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. I enjoy taking drives though. When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. Kind of  like sailing. Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. I feel so  stupid. But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid. too many to list. I can  not wait to go to the football game. I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen. Christina Aguilera's CD is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. It is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here I am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like  70 unbelievable this is supposed to be Texas. I am so glad my Aunt and her  partner are here , even if Lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see Linda. I love accents, I wish I had an english accent. for some  reason I especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love. Another reason I want to move to London, I love the way they talk. I  also love Orlando Bloom who also lives in England, he is gorgeous. But  sometimes I wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. That irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet. They are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet  deal actually, I wish someone would pay me to be someone else so I could live a  fairy tale. Sometimes I wish life were like a movie, not like the Faculty though. more like Kate and Leopold. Mostly love stories, that would be amazing. Though  at the same time it might be too predictable. One can wish though right. I wonder  what I am going to be when I grow up, I mean really grow up. I really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if I have a personalitly, or if I  am just here. How is it possible for people to exist anyways. I don't know if I buy  the whole evolution thing or the Bible. If the Bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from. And if  vice versa then how did the Bible come about. I still  believe there is a God because I think it is important to have something to believe  in. But sometimes I think what if God wasn't real. There would be many times I  would be lost in my life in that case. For some reason. I think there is some sort of  force that looks out for people,  ",1

"So here I go. I'm writing. Don't know what though cause I think this is hard. Tapping fingers. click, click, click I wish it was Friday This is very artificial. Rereading my words  I don't like it. I thought I would have more to say, but so far not much is coming up. I'm a very bad typist? whatever. Let's go on. I like my rings. I have only four on my fingers, I think I need more. All silver. There was a pause there. So much for writing for a full 20 minutes, including ALL thoughts. :)I like that. Look(!),I bet I don't even get a scrolly bar thing. Yes, my one page stream, more like trickle, of consciousness. So anyways I guess I'll be like everyone else and tell you about my dog. He's a cutie. A mutt but I love him the more for it. I think he's his own breed or dog or whatever. Yup, he's a shortie. We're always tripping over him, poor thing. (Pause) Tap, tap, tap. I wish I could type faster, like the girl next to me. Damn her. oohooh, my time's almost up. Did I mention I like my nails too. I painted them real pretty. I'll have to show them to Chela. I can't wait until Friday.

"Right now I am a little worried that I am not doing this right because I don't really know what I am suppose to be writing about. Well, I am excited because my best friend, Courtney, is going to be in Austin in about two hours. She started school in Waxahachie about two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since then. We are going to the lake tomorrow and Labor Day and I can't wait. I love going to the lake with Courtney because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. I am excited about school starting. I have always planned on coming to UT, but I never thought the day would ever actually come. All my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. I think that I will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester I am going to have to take a nursing 310 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that I have to give. I hate giving speeches. I always think that I'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech I start to shake and sweat. I am getting better at it though. I believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. My freshman year in high school I was terrified of getting up in front of the class. I would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what I was saying. It was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. During my junior year I was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior I played at region band and almost made district. I also performed skits and memorized a Shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. I am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that I don't know very well. It's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that I know well or my family and friends. I just feel like people that I don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. Now I just try to forget about that and try to focus on what I have to say. As a nurse I will have to deal with people a lot. I enjoy talking to people one on one, but I will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so I will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. I hope that by the time I graduate college I will have no problem speaking in front of people and that I might even enjoy it. ",0
"My suitemates are talking very loudly in the bathroom. I really should go to bed so I won't be tired in the morning, but I want to get this done so I don't have to worry about it later. The tag on my shirt itches. I need to cut it off. My suitemates left the bathroom, so it's quiet again. My roommate is studying still. Someone just slammed a door down the hall. My suitemates are being loud again. My back kind of hurts. It must be from carrying my backpack around all day. I'm really tired. At least I don't have class until 10 in the morning. I'll get a little more sleep. I need to remember to go to the Co-op tomorrow to pick up the backordered book that just came in. I bet I'm going to end up annoying my roommate typing for twenty minutes straight. I should probably tell her. good, she wasn't paying attention. She asked me why I had to type for twenty minutes. I've only been typing for 5 minutes! My suitemates are still in the bathroom, but they aren't being so loud anymore. My feet hurt from walking all day and my back still hurts. I hope I do well on the economics quiz tomorrow. I studied all my notes and read the chapters. I'm getting sleepier, but I have to finish this. They're being loud again. They are loud a lot. I think the second night I was here, they came in at 4:30 in the morning and woke me up banging around in the bathroom. Me and my roommate are quiet. Someone just got out of the shower and immediately got on the phone because someone called for her and was waiting to talk to her. I think it was Dani, but it may have been Amelia. I can't tell their voices apart yet. I think Amelia is the one with a job at Footlocker. My roommate is popping her knuckles. I pop mine a lot. I need to stop. Everyone says it makes your knuckles big when you get older. I don't think that's true because it is just releasing air from the joint. I just popped my knuckles out of habit. Someone just slammed a door again. Everyone always slams doors. Maybe they don't do it on purpose, but it is still really loud. I only have five minutes left. That's good because I think my roommate is done studying for the evening. Now she is typing on her computer and laughing. She must be IMing someone. It is probably her ex-boyfriend who lives in El Paso, or maybe it is her friend Louie that I met the other day. I wonder who's online that I can talk to right now. Probably no one. I need to go to bed anyway. I'm glad I gat my Calculus homework done. I got a 94 on it, so I'm pretty happy. That's good considering I didn't get any help on it. I need to find a study group for Calculus. I probably need them for all my classes. My roommate asked me if our suitemates are always going out. I said yes. They do go out a lot. I don't think I've ever seen them study. My friend said she hasn't seen her roommate study at all either. I wonder how they are going to pass their classes. I'm almost done. I only have 30 more seconds. Then I get to go to bed. Good night! ",0
"Well, lets see . . . I guess the foremost thing I have on my mind is moderate confusion about what exactly I'm supposed to be writing about. I guess that doubt and lack of confidence about what I'm suppose to be doing is a part of my thoughts and what not and thus is appropriate to write about. Hehe, now I feel confident and more sure of this whole writing assignment. Wow, how quickly my entire psychological outlook can turn 180 degrees. What else?  Im not hungry or anything, not really tired tomorrow. Im a little worried about whether Im going to be awake enough to pay attention in my 8 o'clock class tomorrow. I'm also a little preoccupied by something someone said to me today, labeling me as too quite and inaggressive in committing myself to just about everything. I guess they might be right, I am a little hesistant to get involved in anything I think might not work out or turn out as I expect. I was thinking about rushing for a couple of frats, but then I realized I didnt even know what they were about. I was caught up in the promise of brotherhood and having fun and being a part of something special, but then I realized I didnt know what I was getting in to and that I might not be able to get out if I changed my mind. Thus, I decided not to rush, perhaps because of the fear of commitment and unfulfilled expectations that someone stated dictates most of my actions, or perhaps because I had a valid thought in suspecting I really don't know much about what precisely the fraternity actually did or stood for, who knows?  What else am I thinkin about?  How about how much longer Im suppose to be writing for. I've been writing nine minutes and I havent really noticed. This assignment isnt as bad as I thought it would be and is actually kind of nice. Almost like a diary of my thoughts; definately good for venting. Man, I sure hope this is what I'm suppose to be doing. I hope I didnt entirely miss the purpose of this assignment and not ger credit. I mean, Im writing about my thoughts and stuff, which seems to deal with Psychology and the human mind, so I think Im doing good here, but Im really not sure. Man, I'm getting a little behind in my reading. A lot of the lectures in many of my classes seem to cover the text exactly so Im a little unmotivated to read. I know I should and I know there is some extra information in the book, but really Im just lazy or something. To be honest, Im unsure of what I need to do to succeed in college. I've yet to take a test or quiz so I don't really know what the deal is. I know it is suppose to be harder than high school, or so many people tell me, but then again some people tell me its about the same as high school but with more reading. I don't know . . . . I know I should prolly be more focused on my studies but Im really cocky when it comes to academics. I know the University of Texas is a fine school with many intelligent students, but I still feel Im more capable than just about every one of them. I guess its part cockiness and part confidence. I don't think my attitude about the matter will be altered until I take my first test and totally mess it up. But if I just coast and do fine on the test, Ill keep on coasting. I mean, I pay pretty good attention in my classes and remember a lot, so I think I'll be okay. Ouch, someone just snuck up on me and smacked me. Can't they see Im trying to do my assignment?  How inconsiderate. I guess I would probably do the same. Notbody wants to hear that someone else is busy studying and doesn't have time to do anything even though all of us at some time or another must do the same and decline some invitation to some undoubtedly riveting event or activity in order to tend to less exhilirating, more educational ventures. Hey, only one minute left . . . maybe not, hehe, maybe I can still have some fun. Man, this writing assignment was tyte. It flew by in no time. Actually, I think I feel better now then I did before I started. How cool, if anyone ever read this, these writing assignments rock! ",0
"Just got home in Houston. It's a 2 and a half hour drive. Thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. I pulled to the side and got out of the car. She got out too and I looked at my bumper just a few scratches. I let her go. I am in a hurry! I have a doctors appointment at 4pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 5pm. there goes my afternoon! This is been a busy week and a depressing one. I knew I was going to see Jenn at the CSA meeting but somehow I knew even though I didn't want to see her. I still ended up saying hi to her. What is wrong with me!?!?! I should have just skipped it. I should have also not forced Rona to go into the CSA meeting room. I think she got a little mad at me. I didn't really care. She said she saw Henry and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. She is afraid that he would say something to Shawn or Eugene or those dumb losers. Even though they were my high school friends, I still think Shawn has changed. Well people change. What can I say? I changed for the worst. Does anyone change for the best???? Sometimes I wish I would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. But I end up making the bad ones that I am regretting. Oh well. my friend Chris is messaging me again on I'M maybe it's time to go. Mom is coughing I hope she is ok. She said she is sick because of the car accident. I wonder how bad it was. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to Austin. You see another bad choice of mine. What can I say!?!?!. I am speechless really want to change radically. Stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present??? ",0
